### [1] [Digital Wargames to Enhance Military Medical Evacuation Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06373)
*Jeremy Fischer,Ram Krishnamoorthy,Vishal Kumar,Mahdi Al-Husseini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEWI是一个基于Unity开发的3D多人模拟工具，用于模拟战场医疗撤离网络，提升学生决策能力和学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏在课堂环境中模拟医疗撤离网络并评估规划和决策性能的工具。

Method: 开发MEWI模拟器，模拟战场约束和不确定性，包括患者交互和设施网络。

Result: MEWI显著提高了学生对医疗撤离知识的学习效果和协作决策能力。

Conclusion: MEWI是医疗教育高保真培训工具的重要进步，为联合部队提供了改进医疗撤离教育和操作的关键见解。

Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and
critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating
the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing
a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and
treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to
simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline
planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the
Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer
simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and
uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty
collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and
evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious
island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road
and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as
many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during
didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations
of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical
Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from
student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning
decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify
general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially
improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative
decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of
high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings
offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and
operations across the joint force.

### [2] [Representing Prompting Patterns with PDL: Compliance Agent Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06396)
*Mandana Vaziri,Louis Mandel,Yuji Watanabe,Hirokuni Kitahara,Martin Hirzel,Anca Sailer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Prompt Declaration Language (PDL)的新方法，用于解决LLM提示工程的复杂性，通过提升提示的灵活性和可优化性，显著提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架要么通过限制性API隐藏复杂性，要么提供难以自定义的固定模式，使得高级代理编程变得困难。

Method: 提出了PDL，一种新颖的提示表示方法，将提示置于核心位置，支持手动和自动调优，并整合了LLM调用、规则代码和外部工具的组合。

Result: 通过实际案例研究（合规代理），PDL的提示调优实现了高达4倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: PDL通过抽象化组合的复杂性，提高了程序员效率，并提供了可优化的声明式表示。

Abstract: Prompt engineering for LLMs remains complex, with existing frameworks either
hiding complexity behind restrictive APIs or providing inflexible canned
patterns that resist customization -- making sophisticated agentic programming
challenging. We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach
to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing
prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while
capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and
external tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL
aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative
representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's
utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the
prompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement
compared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern.

### [3] [Jolting Technologies: Superexponential Acceleration in AI Capabilities and Implications for AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06398)
*David Orban*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了Jolting Technologies假说，提出AI能力发展可能呈现超指数增长（即加速增长或正三阶导数）。通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证检测方法，但实证验证仍需纵向数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI能力发展的超指数增长模式及其潜在影响，为未来实证研究提供工具。

Method: 开发理论框架，通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证检测方法，分析缩短的创意到行动间隔和迭代AI改进的复合效应。

Result: 通过模拟验证了检测方法的有效性，为理解AI发展轨迹及其对通用人工智能（AGI）的影响提供了数学基础。

Conclusion: 研究为AI发展轨迹的潜在影响提供了理论支持，对研究和政策制定具有启示意义。

Abstract: This paper investigates the Jolting Technologies Hypothesis, which posits
superexponential growth (increasing acceleration, or a positive third
derivative) in the development of AI capabilities. We develop a theoretical
framework and validate detection methodologies through Monte Carlo simulations,
while acknowledging that empirical validation awaits suitable longitudinal
data. Our analysis focuses on creating robust tools for future empirical
studies and exploring the potential implications should the hypothesis prove
valid. The study examines how factors such as shrinking idea-to-action
intervals and compounding iterative AI improvements drive this jolting pattern.
By formalizing jolt dynamics and validating detection methods through
simulation, this work provides the mathematical foundation necessary for
understanding potential AI trajectories and their consequences for AGI
emergence, offering insights for research and policy.

### [4] [Comparing Dialectical Systems: Contradiction and Counterexample in Belief Change (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06798)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文证明了q-辩证系统比p-辩证系统更强大，而后者又比d-辩证系统更强，强调了反例和矛盾在自动信念修正中的互补作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究辩证系统的目的是为了建模代理如何通过更新知识库来寻求一致性，并统一动态信念管理的可计算框架。

Method: 区分了三种辩证系统模型：d-、p-和q-辩证系统，并通过理论证明比较它们的表达能力。

Result: 证明了q-辩证系统严格强于p-辩证系统，而p-辩证系统又严格强于d-辩证系统。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了反例和矛盾在自动信念修正和数学推理中的互补作用。

Abstract: Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent
updating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by
Roberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working
mathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth.
Dialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an
automated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief
management.
  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems:
(d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be
inconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding
a counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an
open problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are
strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known
to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights
the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief
revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and
research communities.

### [5] [SCC-recursiveness in infinite argumentation (extended version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06852)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何将SCC递归语义扩展到无限论证框架中，提出了两种方法，并评估了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SCC递归语义在无限论证框架中因缺乏良基性而失效的问题。

Method: 提出两种扩展SCC递归语义的方法，并基于Baroni和Giacomin的标准进行系统评估。

Result: 发现方向性在一般情况下失效，但在有限框架中部分语义满足方向性。

Conclusion: 研究为无限论证理论奠定了基础，支持处理无界或动态领域的推理系统。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a foundational tool in artificial
intelligence for modeling structured reasoning and conflict. SCC-recursiveness
is a well-known design principle in which the evaluation of arguments is
decomposed according to the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the attack
graph, proceeding recursively from "higher" to "lower" components. While
SCC-recursive semantics such as \cft and \stgt have proven effective for finite
AFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to
generalize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.
  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite
setting. We systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's
established criteria, showing in particular that directionality fails in
general. We then examine these semantics' behavior in finitary frameworks,
where we find some of our semantics satisfy directionality. These results
advance the theory of infinite argumentation and lay the groundwork for
reasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains.

### [6] [Scaling Towards the Information Boundary of Instruction Set: InfinityInstruct-Subject Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06968)
*Li Du,Hanyu Zhao,Yiming Ju,Tengfei Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种系统化的指令数据构建框架，通过分层标注、种子选择、数据合成和模型诊断生成高质量指令数据集，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令数据集在覆盖范围和深度上有限，导致模型在复杂任务和罕见领域表现不佳，需要系统性改进。

Method: 采用分层标注系统、种子选择算法、进化数据合成和模型诊断生成，形成闭环迭代优化指令数据。

Result: 构建了InfinityInstruct-Subject数据集（150万指令），实验证明其能显著提升模型指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为指令数据集从数量扩张到质量提升提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of
large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks.
Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for
enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction
datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may
still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.
This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of
task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the
instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction
data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,
an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis
process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These
components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage
and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct
InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million
instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.
Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage
and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work
lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous
evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to
qualitative improvement.

*Jieren Deng,Aleksandar Cvetkovic,Pak Kiu Chung,Dragomir Yankov,Chiqun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出三个协作代理解决传统旅行规划系统的不足，提升查询解释、导航精度和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统旅行规划系统静态且碎片化，无法应对现实世界的复杂性和突发变化。

Method: 提出三个代理：旅行规划代理（空间网格和地图分析）、目的地助手代理（精细导航）、本地发现代理（图像嵌入和RAG技术）。

Result: 系统显著提升了查询解释、导航精度和抗干扰能力。

Conclusion: 该系统在从城市探索到应急响应等领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving
them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving
environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper,
we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating
user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter"
navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative
agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and
map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination
Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation
leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image
embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to
trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system
demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation
accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications
from urban exploration to emergency response.

TL;DR: FR3E框架通过结构化探索提升LLM推理能力，解决RLVR的不稳定探索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在提升LLM推理能力时存在探索不稳定的问题，需要更有效的探索方法。

Method: 提出FR3E框架，识别高不确定性决策点并进行针对性探索，构建语义基础的中期反馈。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，FR3E提升了训练稳定性、生成长且连贯的响应，并增加完全正确轨迹的比例。

Conclusion: FR3E通过结构化探索有效提升LLM推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but it struggles with unstable
exploration. We propose FR3E (First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore), a
structured exploration framework that identifies high-uncertainty decision
points in reasoning trajectories and performs targeted rollouts to construct
semantically grounded intermediate feedback. Our method provides targeted
guidance without relying on dense supervision. Empirical results on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks(AIME24) show that FR3E promotes more stable
training, produces longer and more coherent responses, and increases the
proportion of fully correct trajectories. These results highlight the
framework's effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning through more robust and
structured exploration.

### [9] [Unveiling the Underwater World: CLIP Perception Model-Guided Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06234)
*Jiangzhong Cao,Zekai Zeng,Xu Zhang,Huan Zhang,Chunling Fan,Gangyi Jiang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CLIP感知损失模块和课程对比正则化的水下图像增强方法，以提升感知质量和内容恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像质量受光吸收和散射影响，现有深度学习方法忽视人类感知且缺乏解空间约束，导致增强图像感知质量下降或内容恢复不佳。

Method: 利用CLIP模型的视觉语义特征提取能力学习提示对映射和评估图像质量，并将其作为感知损失模块融入增强网络；结合课程对比正则化增强CLIP感知空间约束。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和泛化能力上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 结合CLIP感知损失和课程对比正则化能有效提升水下图像增强的感知质量和内容恢复效果。

Abstract: High-quality underwater images are essential for both machine vision tasks
and viewers with their aesthetic appeal.However, the quality of underwater
images is severely affected by light absorption and scattering. Deep
learning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved
good performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human
perception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.
Consequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual
quality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE
method with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss
module and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a
perception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual
perception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model
is leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the
quality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated
as a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the
perceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model
is integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the
constraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,
mitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.
Specifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize
the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,
ensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and
negatives with varied quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and
generalization ability.

*Ali Nasiri-Sarvi,Hassan Rivaz,Mahdi S. Hosseini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARC框架通过统一潜在空间和跨模型语义一致性，显著提高了不同AI模型间概念对齐的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法因模型间概念空间不兼容而导致的跨模型解释性受限问题。

Method: 引入SPARC框架，采用Global TopK稀疏机制和跨重建损失，实现跨模型和模态的统一潜在空间。

Result: 在Open Images数据集上，SPARC将概念对齐的Jaccard相似度提升至0.80，远超之前方法。

Conclusion: SPARC不仅实现了跨模型概念对齐，还支持文本引导的空间定位和跨模态检索等应用。

Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,
such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically
produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods
like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each
model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model
interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for
Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,
unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,
vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is
enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,
ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given
concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages
semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically
improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than
tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared
sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar
high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of
how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring
manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned
representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided
spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal
retrieval. Code and models are available at

### [11] [A Probabilistic Approach to Uncertainty Quantification Leveraging 3D Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06269)
*Rushil Desai,Frederik Warburg,Trevor Darrell,Marissa Ramirez de Chanlatte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesSDF是一种新的概率框架，用于量化神经隐式SDF模型中的不确定性，解决了现有方法在几何一致性和计算效率上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学模拟应用（如森林环境中的流体流动）需要精确的表面几何和对不确定性的感知，而现有方法缺乏直接几何集成，导致不确定性图校准不佳。

Method: BayesSDF利用拉普拉斯近似，通过基于Hessian的指标量化局部表面不稳定性，实现高效且表面感知的不确定性估计。

Result: 实验表明，BayesSDF在校准和几何一致性上优于现有方法，为下游应用提供了可靠的不确定性度量。

Conclusion: BayesSDF为不确定性感知的3D场景重建、模拟和机器人决策奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly
those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial
challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and
geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric
integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface
geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define
continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical
modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify
local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally
efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that
uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry,
providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF
outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency,
establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction,
simulation, and robotic decision-making.

TL;DR: LIRA框架通过结合语义增强特征提取器和交错局部视觉耦合，解决了大型多模态模型在分割和视觉理解中的不准确和幻觉问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在分割和理解任务中存在不准确分割和幻觉理解的局限性，主要源于视觉理解能力不足和细粒度感知缺失。

Method: 提出LIRA框架，包含语义增强特征提取器（SEFE）和交错局部视觉耦合（ILVC），分别提升分割准确性和减少幻觉理解。

Result: LIRA在分割和理解任务中达到最先进性能，并发现分割精度与语义相关性正相关。

Conclusion: LIRA通过结合语义和局部特征，有效提升了多模态模型的分割和理解能力。

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in
segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations:
inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem
primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of
fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a
framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual
comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced
Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic
and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2)
Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local
descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks,
offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we
find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with
the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship
and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the
Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension
tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

Abstract: Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems play a crucial role in
applications such as historical document digitization, automatic form
processing, and biometric authentication. However, their performance is often
hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly
for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation
techniques designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of HTR systems. We
systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent
advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the
challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting
samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data
scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and
rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies,
which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key
academic sources such as IEEE Digital Library, Springer Link, Science Direct,
and ACM Digital Library. By evaluating existing datasets, assessment metrics,
and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps
and proposes future directions to advance the field of handwritten text
generation across diverse linguistic and stylistic landscapes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CCPDA的数据增强方法，用于改善野火科学中多类分割模型的训练效果，特别是针对火灾类别的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于收集和标注图像用于训练分割模型成本高昂，且野火科学领域缺乏可靠的公开数据集，因此需要一种有效的数据增强方法来缓解这一问题。

Method: CCPDA方法包括三个步骤：(i) 识别源图像中的火灾簇，(ii) 应用中心化技术聚焦火灾核心区域，(iii) 将精炼后的火灾簇粘贴到目标图像上。

Result: 通过数值分析和多目标优化比较，CCPDA显著提升了火灾类别的分割性能，优于其他增强方法。

Conclusion: CCPDA有效解决了小规模手动标注数据集的训练难题，并在火灾类别分割中表现出色。

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation
models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this
challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets
with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data
Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of
deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving
segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)
identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization
technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined
fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity
while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The
effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical
analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a
weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps
elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which
carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,
ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of
the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with
small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA
outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario
considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

*Fuyuan Zhang,Qichen Wang,Jianjun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR2通过对齐干净和损坏图像的类激活图（CAMs）来提升预训练CNN的鲁棒性，无需架构更改，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在常见损坏（如噪声、模糊等）下性能显著下降，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: AR2采用CAM对齐策略，通过迭代修复（CAM引导的细化和标准微调交替）增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: AR2在CIFAR-10-C等基准测试中优于现有方法，平衡了干净数据准确性和损坏鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AR2为提升模型在多样化损坏环境中的可靠性提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when
exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital
distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this
paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet
effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2
operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean
and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention
even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair
strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard
fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments
show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in

Abstract: Multiple object tracking (MOT) technology has made significant progress in
terrestrial applications, but underwater tracking scenarios remain
underexplored despite their importance to marine ecology and aquaculture. We
present Multiple Fish Tracking Dataset 2025 (MFT25), the first comprehensive
dataset specifically designed for underwater multiple fish tracking, featuring
15 diverse video sequences with 408,578 meticulously annotated bounding boxes
across 48,066 frames. Our dataset captures various underwater environments,
fish species, and challenging conditions including occlusions, similar
appearances, and erratic motion patterns. Additionally, we introduce
Scale-aware and Unscented Tracker (SU-T), a specialized tracking framework
featuring an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) optimized for non-linear fish
swimming patterns and a novel Fish-Intersection-over-Union (FishIoU) matching
that accounts for the unique morphological characteristics of aquatic species.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SU-T baseline achieves
state-of-the-art performance on MFT25, with 34.1 HOTA and 44.6 IDF1, while
revealing fundamental differences between fish tracking and terrestrial object
tracking scenarios. MFT25 establishes a robust foundation for advancing
research in underwater tracking systems with important applications in marine
biology, aquaculture monitoring, and ecological conservation. The dataset and

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for
applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction.
Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture
but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce
SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core
contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic
bio-impedance signals from 3D human meshes using shortest-path estimation,
soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for
data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with
decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring
label-aligned synthetic data. We evaluate SImpHAR on our collected ImpAct
dataset and two public benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 22.3% and 21.8%, in terms of
accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively. Our results highlight the promise of
simulation-driven augmentation and modular training for impedance-based HAR.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在新对象或陌生环境中的泛化能力有限，且附加组件增加了计算开销，因此需要探索高效的动作预测方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了35倍推理加速和145 Hz的吞吐量，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: VOTE框架高效且泛化能力强，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Method: 设计了PCL-Former，包含Proposal-Former、Classification-Former和Localization-Former三个模块，每个模块配备专用损失函数。

Result: 在THUMOS14、ActivityNet-1.3和HACS数据集上分别提升2.8%、1.2%和4.8%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PCL-Former通过模块化设计和专用损失函数，显著提升了时间动作定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of transformers and multi-stage architectures
in video recognition and object detection domains. We thoroughly explore the
rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage
architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This
exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer
architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated
transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the
Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may
contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories
within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the
temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate
the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three
challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments.
We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each
individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art
TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS
datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: THOR是一种基于热感应的实时自适应RGB帧采样方法，用于高效捕捉和分类手部活动，显著减少数据量和计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决穿戴式相机连续处理RGB图像时的高功耗、大数据量、隐私问题和计算资源需求。

Method: 利用低分辨率热感数据识别手部活动切换，动态调整RGB帧采样率，并结合热感线索定位手部交互区域以减少图像处理范围。

Result: 仅需3%的原始RGB数据即可捕捉全部活动段，手部活动识别F1分数达95%，与全RGB视频（94%）相当。

Conclusion: THOR为穿戴式相机实时监测手部活动和健康风险行为提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Wearable cameras are increasingly used as an observational and interventional
tool for human behaviors by providing detailed visual data of hand-related
activities. This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging
of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However,
continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant
power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video
data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial
computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time
adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal
sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use
low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches
from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling
rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during
periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the
hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in
each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part
of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate
our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30
activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9
countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3%
of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments,
and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to
using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for
the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and
health-risk behaviors in real time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件自动编码器的高效事件数据压缩与重建方法，显著提升了事件相机的物体检测性能，适用于实时边缘计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧式视觉系统在动态环境中存在运动模糊、高延迟和冗余数据处理问题，事件相机虽有潜力但面临稀疏和噪声事件流的挑战。

Method: 采用卷积编码的事件自动编码器架构，结合自适应阈值选择和轻量级分类器，优化识别精度并降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在SEFD数据集上，模型精度与YOLO-v4相当，但参数减少35.5倍；在嵌入式平台上实现8-44.8 FPS的高帧率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了事件相机的性能，适用于低功耗、高速实时边缘计算应用。

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in
applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency,
and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic
environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at
the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object
detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an
event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs
event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The
proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive
threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition
accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the
existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$
fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi
4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8
FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the
state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance,
making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge
computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习和大型语言模型的视频推理方法需要大量监督微调和长链思维标注，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 跳过资源密集的监督微调步骤，采用纯强化学习训练和稀疏到密集的视频测试时间缩放策略。

Result: 在多个视频推理基准测试中，Video-RTS平均准确率提升2.4%，仅需3.6%的训练样本。

Conclusion: Video-RTS通过纯强化学习和自适应视频缩放策略，显著提升了视频推理的效率和性能。

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with
large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant
challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,
making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a
new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved
data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time
scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL
samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL
training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or
extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more
efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves
inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate
our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS
surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy
using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%
improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning
benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and
adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong
reasoning performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Mask6D的新型预训练策略，通过结合2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图，提升了单目RGB图像在复杂或遮挡条件下的6D物体姿态估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前姿态估计网络在复杂场景中难以提取具有区分性的姿态感知特征，尤其是在目标被遮挡时RGB信息有限的情况下。

Method: 引入2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图作为额外模态信息，结合RGB图像进行基于重建的模型预训练，并设计了专注于物体的预训练损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于以往的端到端姿态估计方法。

Conclusion: Mask6D通过预训练策略显著提升了姿态估计的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using
monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current
pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware
features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB
information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate
this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named
Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and
visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB
images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D
correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the
pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the
integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard
cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training
loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the
background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware
network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose
prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous
end-to-end pose estimation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉-语言模型（VLM）生成的整体粗粒度特征，与检测任务的细粒度需求矛盾。

Method: BC-HOI框架包含ABG和LSG组件，分别通过注意力偏差和细粒度监督提升交互特征质量。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中表现优异，开放和封闭场景均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BC-HOI框架有效解决了开放词汇HOI检测中的细粒度特征问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging
task that detects all <human, verb, object> triplets of interest in an image,
even those that are not pre-defined in the training set. Existing approaches
typically rely on output features generated by large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to enhance the generalization ability of interaction representations.
However, the visual features produced by VLMs are holistic and coarse-grained,
which contradicts the nature of detection tasks. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Bilateral Collaboration framework for open vocabulary HOI
detection (BC-HOI). This framework includes an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG)
component, which guides the VLM to produce fine-grained instance-level
interaction features according to the attention bias provided by the HOI
detector. It also includes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Supervision
Guidance (LSG) component, which provides fine-grained token-level supervision
for the HOI detector by the LLM component of the VLM. LSG enhances the ability
of ABG to generate high-quality attention bias. We conduct extensive
experiments on two popular benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO, consistently
achieving superior performance in the open vocabulary and closed settings. The
code will be released in Github.

Motivation: 传统自监督学习（SSL）方法在数字病理学中因依赖小区域补丁级训练和自然图像增强而忽略复杂领域特征，且数据效率低。

Method: EXAONE Path 2.0通过直接在全幻灯片级别监督下学习补丁级表示，提升了数据效率和性能。

Result: 在10项生物标志物预测任务中达到最优平均性能，仅需37k WSIs训练。

Conclusion: EXAONE Path 2.0显著提高了病理学任务的数据效率和预测性能，为领域提供了更高效的基础模型。

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle
due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via
self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings
via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks.
However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are
essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular
characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for
natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain
less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive
computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To
address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation
model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level
supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves
state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks,
demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

Conclusion: CDR-CA任务及多源DPP方法为结果多样化提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval
for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods
focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,
the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,
which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called
CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims
to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the
application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a
simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)
to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified
similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent
Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: HDR视频重建中，交替曝光方法导致的曝光波动常引起闪烁问题，需要一种更稳定的解决方案。

Method: 使用双摄像头系统（DCS）分别捕获参考和非参考序列，并设计EAFNet网络进行特征对齐、融合和重建。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，验证了DCS在HDR视频重建中的潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的DCS和EAFNet方法有效解决了闪烁问题，为HDR视频重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from
alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue,
we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one
camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other
is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation.
To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive
fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a
pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively
emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the
enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork,
which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by
aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the
reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce
ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great
potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured
by DCS will be available at https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS.

Result: FIFA比现有评估方法更符合人类判断，Post-Correction有效提高了文本和视频生成的事实一致性。

Conclusion: FIFA和Post-Correction为解决VideoMLLMs中的幻觉问题提供了有效工具，提升了模型的事实一致性。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often
suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual
input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also
fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address
this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that
extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies
via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using
VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction
framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation
methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in
both text and video generation.

Conclusion: GreenHyperSpectra为植物功能性状评估与表征学习的交叉研究提供了方法论框架和数据支持。

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential
variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However,
conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at
ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable
solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral
data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral
data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across
sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods.
Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing
real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait
prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation
framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We
successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient
multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised
baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in
learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a
comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection
of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment. All code and

*Chaoshuo Zhang,Chenhao Lin,Zhengyu Zhao,Le Yang,Qian Wang,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为KSCU的新方法，通过针对扩散模型的关键步骤进行概念遗忘，平衡了遗忘效果与生成能力的保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念遗忘方法难以平衡遗忘效果与生成能力，导致扩散模型的安全风险。

Method: KSCU方法利用扩散模型的逐步采样特性，仅对关键步骤进行微调，减少参数更新。

Result: 实验表明，KSCU能有效阻止不良图像生成，同时保留模型生成能力。

Conclusion: KSCU是一种高效的概念遗忘方法，适用于文本到图像扩散模型。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion,
which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely
used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing
concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to
balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this
limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU)
method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling
characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation
process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally,
KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the
final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and
fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the
number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing
the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive
benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs
from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's
generative capabilities.Our code will be released.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Percep360的全景生成方法，用于自动驾驶，解决了现有方法在数据分布固定和可控性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要全景感知，但数据采集和标注复杂耗时。现有生成模型无法实现高质量可控的全景生成。

Method: 提出了局部场景扩散方法（LSDM）和概率提示方法（PPM），分别解决信息丢失和可控生成问题。

Result: 生成图像在无参考质量指标上优于原始拼接图像，并提升了下游感知模型的性能。

Conclusion: Percep360在自动驾驶全景生成中表现出色，具有高质量和可控性，代码将开源。

Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving,
enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a
single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete
panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation
pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing
street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration
capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing
datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In
this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for
autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data
with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on
two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the
inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose
the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama
generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps
between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable
generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method
(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling
controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e.,
no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in
real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data
consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality
metrics and enhances downstream perception models. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/Bryant-Teng/Percep360.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种完整的流水线系统，将英语语音转换为流畅的3D手语动画，结合语音识别、文本翻译和动作生成技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助聋人和听力障碍者更轻松地沟通，填补了将口语转换为手语动画的研究空白。

Method: 使用Whisper进行语音转文本，MarianMT模型将文本翻译为ASL gloss，结合Word2Vec和FastText优化翻译，并通过3D关键点系统生成动画。

Result: 系统表现良好，BLEU分数达到0.7714和0.8923，并创建了新的数据集Sign3D-WLASL和BookGlossCorpus-CG。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个从语音到3D手语动画的完整框架，优于以往专注于单一任务的系统。

Abstract: Helping deaf and hard-of-hearing people communicate more easily is the main
goal of Automatic Sign Language Translation. Although most past research has
focused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken
English into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's
because it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating
it into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this
work, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into
smooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper
to translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine
translation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)
gloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without
grammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.
To make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such
as Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the
translated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on
Sign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key
points from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss
translation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which
turns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss
using grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly
interpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike
previous works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use
only one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in
a single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D
sign language animation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高精度工业场景（如半导体制造）中缺乏专业基准数据集的问题，推动复杂过程建模与预测的研究。

Method: 构建CHDL数据集，并提出DIFFUMA模型，结合并行Mamba模块和扩散模块，分别捕捉全局时间上下文和增强细粒度空间细节。

Result: DIFFUMA在CHDL基准上表现优异，MSE降低39%，SSIM从0.926提升至0.988，且泛化能力良好。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了新的SOTA模型，还为工业AI领域贡献了宝贵的数据资源。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains,
ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in
high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the
absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling
and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold
contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset
(CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor
wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL
provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process
modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose
DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed
for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal
context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a
diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance
fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation.
Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly
outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and
improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988.
This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our
work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more
importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive
future research in industrial AI.

Abstract: We present 4KAgent, a unified agentic super-resolution generalist system
designed to universally upscale any image to 4K resolution (and even higher, if
applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low
resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at

core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline
based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages
vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze
the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration
Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection
paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the
optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face
restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and
selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task
categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new
state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover
natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery,
fluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and
X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g.,
NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic
paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and
innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research
communities. We will release all the code, models, and results at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类驾驶行为的启发，旨在解决现有方法在动态交互时空协调和适应性方面的不足。

Method: 采用逆向学习注意力机制（IL Attention）建模交互意图，并引入动态锚点选择模块（DAS）提取关键轨迹点。

Result: 在INTERACTION和Argoverse数据集上达到最优性能，尤其在复杂交互场景中表现更佳。

Conclusion: ILNet通过动态建模交互意图和自适应锚点选择，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和多模态分布能力。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial
challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently
factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static
and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,
capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the
modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a
fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different
future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust
initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of
surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes
ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)
attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an
inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,
introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal
coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture
complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to
extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost
no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion
forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet
achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over
fewer parameters. Our codes are available at https://github.com/mjZeng11/ILNet.

Motivation: 野生动物数据标注和模型训练成本高，现有主动学习方法需要完全访问模型，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出模型无关的主动学习方法，结合对象和图像层面的不确定性与多样性进行样本选择。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用30%的训练数据，动物检测器性能可达到或超过完整数据集的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了数据标注成本，为自动化野生动物监测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Smart data selection is becoming increasingly important in data-driven
machine learning. Active learning offers a promising solution by allowing
machine learning models to be effectively trained with optimal data including
the most informative samples from large datasets. Wildlife data captured by
camera traps are excessive in volume, requiring tremendous effort in data
labelling and animal detection models training. Therefore, applying active
learning to optimise the amount of labelled data would be a great aid in
enabling automated wildlife monitoring and conservation. However, existing
active learning techniques require that a machine learning model (i.e., an
object detector) be fully accessible, limiting the applicability of the
techniques. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic active learning approach
for detection of animals captured by camera traps. Our approach integrates
uncertainty and diversity quantities of samples at both the object-based and
image-based levels into the active learning sample selection process. We
validate our approach in a benchmark animal dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that, using only 30% of the training data selected by our approach,
a state-of-the-art animal detector can achieve a performance of equal or
greater than that with the use of the complete training dataset.

Motivation: 解决现有SOTA模型在处理轴向、冠状和矢状解剖平面时性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出FOLC-Net框架，结合MRFO优化、全局模型克隆和ConvNeXt，参数少且存储需求低。

Result: 在矢状视角下准确率达92.44%，优于其他方法，并在多视角中表现稳健。

Conclusion: FOLC-Net为分散式环境中的医学图像分析提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined
as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It
specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal
anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which
incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with
approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9
MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for
efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable
training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was
evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as
axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical
imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different
data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The
results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the
challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of
92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of
study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,
FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing
a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized
environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by
providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views
while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation
of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs
better in real-world medical applications.

Conclusion: ToBo能够有效学习动态场景的时序依赖关系，并在不同模型规模上展现出可扩展性。

Abstract: Deriving compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic
scenes is essential for successful execution of sequential scene understanding
tasks such as visual tracking and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we
introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised
learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts
the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline
facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively
encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze
step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by
predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target
patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal
dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across
scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video
label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate
the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained
model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in
real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across
different model scales.

Conclusion: MK-Pose通过多模态融合和图增强特征显著提升了类别级物体姿态估计的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation, which predicts the pose of objects
within a known category without prior knowledge of individual instances, is
essential in applications like warehouse automation and manufacturing. Existing
methods relying on RGB images or point cloud data often struggle with object
occlusion and generalization across different instances and categories. This
paper proposes a multimodal-based keypoint learning framework (MK-Pose) that
integrates RGB images, point clouds, and category-level textual descriptions.
The model uses a self-supervised keypoint detection module enhanced with
attention-based query generation, soft heatmap matching and graph-based
relational modeling. Additionally, a graph-enhanced feature fusion module is
designed to integrate local geometric information and global context. MK-Pose
is evaluated on CAMERA25 and REAL275 dataset, and is further tested for
cross-dataset capability on HouseCat6D dataset. The results demonstrate that
MK-Pose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both IoU and average
precision without shape priors. Codes will be released at

Conclusion: Concept-TRAK为生成式AI的负责任开发和治理提供了可操作的见解，解决了概念级归因的需求。

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption
raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency.
Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire
image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as
styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called
\emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key
innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion
posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a
concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate
Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior
methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected
and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional
learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable
insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，同时发布了首个公开数据集CSG-405，促进相关研究。

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic,
audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions
and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant
one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by
the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We
propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an
efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our
approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio
segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image,
predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure
strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons
are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the
speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize
research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of
high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and
diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while
generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Result: DSF在kNN分类和线性评估等任务中表现优异，且效率更高。

Conclusion: DSF无需温度超参数即可有效运行，优于余弦相似度。

Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more
effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior
methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily
capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all
views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF)
that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of
augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence
between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently
improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and
linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other
multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between
DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF
operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散和自回归视频生成模型在视觉上表现优异，但缺乏物理准确性，无法模拟真实世界的物体运动。

Method: 通过提取输入视频的运动轨迹，利用检索式预训练增强符号回归，发现运动方程以预测物理准确的未来轨迹，并引导视频生成。

Result: 在经典力学场景（如弹簧-质量系统、摆锤和抛体运动）中，该方法成功恢复了真实运动方程，并提升了生成视频的物理对齐性。

Conclusion: 该框架无需微调现有模型，即可显著提高视频生成的物理准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models
have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack
accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object
motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned
statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical
laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates
symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for
physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories
from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance
symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically
accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation
without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in
Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions,
our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves
the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出SpatialReasoner框架，通过LLM驱动的空间推理改进开放词汇3D视觉定位，解决现有方法在空间关系推理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言场方法在基于空间关系的语言查询（如“椅子上的书”）中定位实例时表现不佳，主要因缺乏对语言查询和3D场景中空间关系的推理能力。

Method: 提出SpatialReasoner框架，包括：1）微调LLM以捕获空间关系并推断目标、锚点和空间关系指令；2）结合视觉属性构建分层特征场，使用CLIP特征和SAM掩码表示语言和实例特征。

Result: 实验表明，该框架可无缝集成到不同神经表示中，显著提升3D视觉定位性能，并增强空间推理能力。

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner通过LLM驱动的空间推理和分层特征场，有效解决了开放词汇3D视觉定位中的空间关系推理问题。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on
free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such
as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language
fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D
scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target
objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods
struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language
queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from
inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D
scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural
representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial
reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature
field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in
language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial
relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial
relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner
incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical
feature field. This field represents language and instance features using
distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a
hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial
relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework
can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,
outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their
spatial reasoning capability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数EBT，通过将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，改进了传统WBCE损失在边缘检测中的模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WBCE损失在处理非边缘像素时忽略了结构差异，导致预测模糊。

Method: 提出EBT损失，将像素分为三类并分配不同权重，以更结构化地学习边缘和边界。

Result: 实验证明EBT损失在多个基准测试中表现优异，且超参数鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: EBT损失易于部署且性能优越，是边缘检测的有效改进。

Abstract: Edge detection (ED) remains a fundamental task in computer vision, yet its
performance is often hindered by the ambiguous nature of non-edge pixels near
object boundaries. The widely adopted Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss
treats all non-edge pixels uniformly, overlooking the structural nuances around
edges and often resulting in blurred predictions. In this paper, we propose the
Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective that explicitly divides
pixels into three categories, edge, boundary, and texture, and assigns each a
distinct supervisory weight. This tri-class formulation enables more structured
learning by guiding the model to focus on both edge precision and contextual
boundary localization. We theoretically show that the EBT loss generalizes the
WBCE loss, with the latter becoming a limit case. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the EBT loss both
quantitatively and perceptually. Furthermore, the consistent use of unified
hyperparameters across all models and datasets, along with robustness to their
moderate variations, indicates that the EBT loss requires minimal fine-tuning
and is easily deployable in practice.

TL;DR: IAP是一种新的对抗性补丁攻击框架，通过感知感知定位和扰动优化方案生成高度不可见的对抗性补丁，显著提升了攻击成功率和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在针对性攻击场景中表现不佳或生成的补丁不连贯，容易被人类或自动防御系统发现。

Method: IAP结合类定位和敏感度图选择补丁位置，并采用感知正则化对抗损失和颜色恒常性梯度更新规则优化扰动。

Result: IAP在多种图像基准和模型架构中表现出高攻击成功率和隐蔽性，能有效绕过现有防御系统。

Conclusion: IAP在对抗性补丁攻击中实现了高效性和隐蔽性，为防御系统提出了新挑战。

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches
can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior
methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or
fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be
easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against
automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack
framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on
perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.
Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by
leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the
susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human
visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a
gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible
perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and
model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive
attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch
invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly
imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several
state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在粗粒度匹配和语义线索忽视方面存在问题，MOST通过利用细粒度片段关系来解决这些问题。

Method: MOST采用时间片段Banzhaf交互量化文本-运动一致性，并通过运动提示模块生成语义一致的运动。

Result: MOST在文本到运动的检索和生成方面达到最先进水平，尤其在罕见提示上表现突出。

Conclusion: MOST通过细粒度匹配和消除冗余，显著提升了文本到运动生成的效果。

Abstract: We introduce MOST, a novel motion diffusion model via temporal clip Banzhaf
interaction, aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of generating human
motion from rare language prompts. While previous approaches struggle with
coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion
redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships
to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation
of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies
textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct,
fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy.
In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved
motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive
evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion
retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous
challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results
highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.

Conclusion: 自适应模糊度感知方法显著优于传统均等惩罚方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D
semantic segmentation on point clouds. Most existing methods use equally
penalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less
discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly
ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually
annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points
would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design
AMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity
estimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points
based on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,
which ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes
for high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position
discrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by
the assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking
ambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further
propose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where
a novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from
generated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that
leverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more
reliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.
Experimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期动作识别（LTAR）因时间跨度长、动作关联复杂及视觉干扰而具有挑战性。现有方法多依赖统计相关性而非因果机制，且缺乏跨模态因果建模。

Method: CMDCL通过文本因果干预解决文本嵌入中的跨模态偏差，并通过视觉因果干预去除视觉模态中的干扰因素。

Result: 在Charades、Breakfast和COIN三个基准测试中，CMDCL表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CMDCL通过双因果干预实现了鲁棒的动作表示，为长期动作识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal
spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on
statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing
causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal
causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes
\textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning
(CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal
relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal
intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through
visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text.
  These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to
address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including
Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学应用中易产生幻觉，影响可靠性，而现有偏好优化方法面临样本无关、数据分布不平衡和专家标注成本高的问题。

Method: 提出CheXPO策略，通过多任务视觉指令数据集进行监督微调，利用置信度分析和相似性检索扩展困难样本，结合反事实推理提供临床偏好。

Result: 实验显示，CheXPO仅用5%的监督微调样本即实现8.93%的性能提升，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: CheXPO为放射学应用提供了可扩展、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically
compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization
can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation
faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced
data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these
challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy
that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale.
Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest
X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level
confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to
expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while
synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences,
eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO
achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching
state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a
scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

Motivation: 医学高光谱成像（MHSI）在疾病诊断中潜力巨大，但高维度和光谱冗余特性使其空间和光谱信息融合具有挑战性。

Method: 设计了跨维度特征融合操作，包括双向注意力机制、光谱引导的空间查询选择和两阶段跨维度解码器。

Result: 在两个显微高光谱图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法在DSC指标上比现有方法提升了5.73%。

Conclusion: Omni-Fuse网络在保持高效执行的同时，显著提升了高光谱图像的分割性能。

Abstract: Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) has emerged as a promising tool for
enhanced disease diagnosis, particularly in computational pathology, offering
rich spectral information that aids in identifying subtle biochemical
properties of tissues. Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both
spatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains
challenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent
characteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel
spatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation,
named as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature
fusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that
refines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention
mechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most
spectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage
cross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the
selected spatial query. Despite of numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains
efficient in execution. Experiments on two microscopic hyperspectral image
datasets show that our approach can significantly improve the segmentation
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, with over 5.73 percent
improvement in DSC. Code available at:

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus基准测试中，MCA-RG表现优异。

Conclusion: MCA-RG通过知识驱动的方法显著提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和临床适用性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for
radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to
difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to
their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature
extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To
address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report
Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual
features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation
process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing
lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The
visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored
enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure
to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching
loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.
Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality
concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual
medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.
Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate
that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in
radiology report generation.

Motivation: 现有投影方法依赖固定参数，无法适应不同视点的几何变化，导致投影多样性不足和计算冗余。

Method: 设计了VDP框架，通过数据驱动生成自适应投影，并结合颜色正则化优化特征提取。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet基准测试中表现优异，计算成本低。

Conclusion: PointVDP提供了一种资源高效的语义理解解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose view-dependent projection (VDP) to facilitate point
cloud segmentation, designing efficient 3D-to-2D mapping that dynamically
adapts to the spatial geometry from view variations. Existing projection-based
methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on
straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions.
However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to
pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and
failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view
planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to
enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive
computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these
limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections
from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs
by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition,
we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes
essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic
features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a
projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight
projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet
benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a
resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了NSCLC生存预测的准确性，为个性化治疗提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing
immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling
informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality
of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective
multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this
domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and
introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing
the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and
corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning
approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each
tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting
3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node
features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion
process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model
utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism
improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more
effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival
prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for
prognostic models in this context.

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏标注场景下表现出色，为医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain.
This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially
true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed,
this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few
annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized,
can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately
available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction
task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d
carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic
planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the
problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image
and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient
learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse
labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations.
Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints,
highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense
annotations are challenging to obtain.

Abstract: The visualization of volumetric medical data is crucial for enhancing
diagnostic accuracy and improving surgical planning and education. Cinematic
rendering techniques significantly enrich this process by providing
high-quality visualizations that convey intricate anatomical details, thereby
facilitating better understanding and decision-making in medical contexts.
However, the high computing cost and low rendering speed limit the requirement
of interactive visualization in practical applications. In this paper, we
introduce ClipGS, an innovative Gaussian splatting framework with the clipping
plane supported, for interactive cinematic visualization of volumetric medical
data. To address the challenges posed by dynamic interactions, we propose a
learnable truncation scheme that automatically adjusts the visibility of
Gaussian primitives in response to the clipping plane. Besides, we also design
an adaptive adjustment model to dynamically adjust the deformation of Gaussians
and refine the rendering performance. We validate our method on five volumetric
medical data (including CT and anatomical slice data), and reach an average
36.635 PSNR rendering quality with 156 FPS and 16.1 MB model size,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and efficiency.

*Juncheng Mu,Chengwei Ren,Weixiang Zhang,Liang Pan,Xiao-Ping Zhang,Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff$^2$I2P提出了一种基于扩散模型的图像到点云（I2P）配准框架，通过控制侧分数蒸馏（CSD）和可变形对应调整（DCT）模块，解决了跨模态特征对齐的挑战，显著提升了配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过度量学习实现跨模态特征对齐，但忽视了图像与点云数据之间的固有模态差异，导致跨模态对应关系不准确。

Method: 提出Diff$^2$I2P框架，利用扩散模型作为先验，结合CSD技术优化变换预测，并通过DCT模块实现可微的对应关系估计和变换求解。

Result: 在7-Scenes基准测试中，Diff$^2$I2P比现有最优方法提高了7%以上的配准召回率。

Conclusion: Diff$^2$I2P通过扩散模型和可微设计，显著提升了跨模态配准性能，为I2P配准提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning cross-modal correspondences is essential for image-to-point cloud
(I2P) registration. Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric
learning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the
inherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm
struggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired
by the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we
propose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework,
leveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap.
Specifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to
distill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize
the predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail
to backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability
of correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a
Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences
in a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a
differentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves
as a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point
cloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the
registration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P
consistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7%
improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.

### [61] [An AI Approach for Learning the Spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07073)
*Yulin An,Enrique del Castillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于几何深度学习的框架，用于高效预测CAD网格的Laplace-Beltrami谱，显著节省计算时间且保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法（FEM）在计算Laplace-Beltrami谱时效率较低，尤其在需要频繁处理大型网格数据库或实时质量控制的场景中。

Method: 采用图神经网络架构，结合高斯曲率、平均曲率和主曲率等丰富的网格特征，预测Laplace-Beltrami谱。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比线性FEM节省约5倍计算时间，同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: 证明了Laplace-Beltrami谱的可学习性，并提供了公开数据集以支持可重复性。

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric
deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object
under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a
triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),
and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is
the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when
repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control
applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions
about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution
to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the
LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant
computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB
spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a
rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,
and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make
available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical
CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training
and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time
of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering
competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: D2I框架通过规则奖励提升多模态LLMs的推理能力，无需额外标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态推理研究中模态对齐和训练成本高的问题。

Method: 提出D2I框架，训练时使用规则奖励增强模态对齐，评估时转为直觉推理。

Result: D2I在多个基准测试中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: D2I展示了规则奖励对提升多模态LLMs推理能力的作用，并启发了训练与测试推理深度的解耦。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly
when applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However,
multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality
alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data
annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and
reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the
Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the
understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra
annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate
reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based
format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to
intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and
implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I
outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our
findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable
reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time
reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.

Result: 实验表明，SPGD显著提升了生成稳定性，在定量指标和视觉效果上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: SPGD通过梯度管理技术有效解决了扩散模型中的不稳定性问题，为图像恢复任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by
leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration
problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a
denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions
between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In
this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and
identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts
between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal
fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these
instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration
performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive
Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD
integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up
strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum
(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive
experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD
significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexGaussian是一种无需重新训练的高效3D高斯压缩方法，结合混合精度量化和属性判别剪枝，实现高压缩比（96.4%）和快速部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模3D模型对压缩的需求增加，现有方法缺乏灵活性且需重新训练。

Method: 采用混合精度量化和属性判别剪枝，无需重新训练。

Result: 压缩比达96.4%，渲染质量损失小（PSNR下降<1 dB），速度比现有方法快1.7-2.1倍。

Conclusion: FlexGaussian是一种灵活、高效的压缩方法，适用于移动设备。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has become a prominent technique for representing and
rendering complex 3D scenes, due to its high fidelity and speed advantages.
However, the growing demand for large-scale models calls for effective
compression to reduce memory and computation costs, especially on mobile and
edge devices with limited resources. Existing compression methods effectively
reduce 3D Gaussian parameters but often require extensive retraining or
fine-tuning, lacking flexibility under varying compression constraints.
  In this paper, we introduce FlexGaussian, a flexible and cost-effective
method that combines mixed-precision quantization with attribute-discriminative
pruning for training-free 3D Gaussian compression. FlexGaussian eliminates the
need for retraining and adapts easily to diverse compression targets.
Evaluation results show that FlexGaussian achieves up to 96.4% compression
while maintaining high rendering quality (<1 dB drop in PSNR), and is
deployable on mobile devices. FlexGaussian delivers high compression ratios
within seconds, being 1.7-2.1x faster than state-of-the-art training-free
methods and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches. The code is being
prepared and will be released soon at:

Result: 在FSC-147、CARPK、PUCPR+和ShanghaiTech等标准基准测试中表现出强大的零样本类无关计数泛化能力。

Conclusion: QUANet通过增强数量感知和双流解码器设计，显著提升了计数任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative
methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in
images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately
distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose
QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a
vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness.
Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a
Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN
enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The
T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation
between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss
is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the
two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147,
CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability
for zero-shot class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明STG-Mamba显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STG-Mamba在音乐到舞蹈视频的合成任务中表现出色，通过创新的空间-时间建模和自监督方法提升了效果。

Abstract: We propose a novel spatial-temporal graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) for the
music-guided dance video synthesis task, i.e., to translate the input music to
a dance video. STG-Mamba consists of two translation mappings:
music-to-skeleton translation and skeleton-to-video translation. In the
music-to-skeleton translation, we introduce a novel spatial-temporal graph
Mamba (STGM) block to effectively construct skeleton sequences from the input
music, capturing dependencies between joints in both the spatial and temporal
dimensions. For the skeleton-to-video translation, we propose a novel
self-supervised regularization network to translate the generated skeletons,
along with a conditional image, into a dance video. Lastly, we collect a new
skeleton-to-video translation dataset from the Internet, containing 54,944
video clips. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STG-Mamba achieves
significantly better results than existing methods.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在视觉与文本表示之间的差异问题，同时避免对注释的依赖。

Method: 采用分层特征提取（帧、片段、视频级）并与伪注释和口语对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了BLEU-4和ROUGE分数，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: 分层预训练策略有效提升了手语翻译的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) attempts to convert sign language videos into
spoken sentences. However, many existing methods struggle with the disparity
between visual and textual representations during end-to-end learning.
Gloss-based approaches help to bridge this gap by leveraging structured
linguistic information. While, gloss-free methods offer greater flexibility and
remove the burden of annotation, they require effective alignment strategies.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled gloss-free SLT by
generating text-like representations from sign videos. In this work, we
introduce a novel hierarchical pre-training strategy inspired by the structure
of sign language, incorporating pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language
alignment. Our method hierarchically extracts features at frame, segment, and
video levels, aligning them with pseudo-glosses and the spoken sentence to
enhance translation quality. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves
BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了医学图像异常检测的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is challenging due to diverse imaging
modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data. We propose a novel
approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal
Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to
medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which
often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts
aligned with local features via POT to capture subtle abnormalities. CL further
enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios
without synthetic data or memory banks. The code is available at

Conclusion: RPFNet通过频域建模和残差先验，高效解决了图像融合中的关键问题，提升了融合质量和任务性能。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to
generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of
high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show
promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial
domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of
ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features
effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven
Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a
dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)
extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby
providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module
(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through
frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)
enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures
through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an
auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's
sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of
adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively
constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details
and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.
Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which
effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and
salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the
high-level vision task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定频率的缓存机制在复杂场景中会导致质量下降，手动调整阈值效率低且缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出PCA缓存，根据输入提示估计场景复杂度自动调整重用阈值；改进TeaCache的输入输出关系建模；引入动态CFGCache机制。

Result: 在Wan2.1模型上实现了2.79倍的加速，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: PCA缓存和动态CFGCache的结合有效解决了推理速度瓶颈，同时保证了生成质量。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major
bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via
caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such
fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while
manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To
address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that
automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated
directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,
PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional
caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a
key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to
an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance
the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's
predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To
further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with
DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free
guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for
more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example,
2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across
a range of scenes.

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到人物图像匹配提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, as a crucial approach to
reducing models' reliance on large-scale manually labeled samples, holds
significant research value. However, existing methods struggle to predict
complex one-to-many identity relationships, severely limiting performance
improvements. To address this challenge, we propose a local-and-global
dual-granularity identity association mechanism. Specifically, at the local
level, we explicitly establish cross-modal identity relationships within a
batch, reinforcing identity constraints across different modalities and
enabling the model to better capture subtle differences and correlations. At
the global level, we construct a dynamic cross-modal identity association
network with the visual modality as the anchor and introduce a confidence-based
dynamic adjustment mechanism, effectively enhancing the model's ability to
identify weakly associated samples while improving overall sensitivity.
Additionally, we propose an information-asymmetric sample pair construction
method combined with consistency learning to tackle hard sample mining and
enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method substantially boosts cross-modal matching accuracy, providing an
efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching.

with 98.3\% word accuracy and 0.0024 character error rate on synthetic data,
while crucially maintaining 93.1\% accuracy on real-world handwritten

Abstract: Thermal imaging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) holds significant
potential for applications in search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, and
emergency response, especially under low-light or obscured conditions. However,
the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the
advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high
cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we
introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images
from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into
existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and
orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the
background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object
categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the
HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating
these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across
both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new
applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors
outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the
importance of replicating aerial viewing angles. Project page:

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to restore vivid content and details
from corrupted low-light images. However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color
space-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due
to the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)
color space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red
and black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color
space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV
color map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances
for the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable
intensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.
Additionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+
(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and
mitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+
leverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light
images using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel
Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can
promote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color
correction, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the
meticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we
construct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for
information-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,
ensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark
experiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that
has been extensively studied in recent years. Traditional approaches often rely
on external modules like Class Activation Maps to highlight regions of interest
and generate pseudo segmentation masks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end
method that directly utilizes the attention maps learned by a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for WSSS. We propose training a sparse ViT with multiple
[CLS] tokens (one for each class), using a random masking strategy to promote
[CLS] token - class assignment. At inference time, we aggregate the different
self-attention maps of each [CLS] token corresponding to the predicted labels
to generate pseudo segmentation masks. Our proposed approach enhances the
interpretability of self-attention maps and ensures accurate class assignments.
Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and three specialized datasets
demonstrate that our method generates accurate pseudo-masks, outperforming
related works. Those pseudo-masks can be used to train a segmentation model
which achieves results comparable to fully-supervised models, significantly
reducing the need for fine-grained labeled data.

Abstract: This study presents findings from long-term biometric evaluations conducted
at the Biometric Evaluation Center (bez). Over the course of two and a half
years, our ongoing research with over 400 participants representing diverse
ethnicities, genders, and age groups were regularly assessed using a variety of
biometric tools and techniques at the controlled testing facilities. Our
findings are based on the General Data Protection Regulation-compliant local
bez database with more than 238.000 biometric data sets categorized into
multiple biometric modalities such as face and finger. We used state-of-the-art
face recognition algorithms to analyze long-term comparison scores. Our results
show that these scores fluctuate more significantly between individual days
than over the entire measurement period. These findings highlight the
importance of testing biometric characteristics of the same individuals over a
longer period of time in a controlled measurement environment and lays the
groundwork for future advancements in biometric data analysis.

Conclusion: SemRaFiner通过优化特征提取和训练流程，显著提升了雷达点云的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of
moving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of
autonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene
understanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse
weather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome
these limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by
measuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and
noisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse
radar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called
SemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and
optimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy. Furthermore, we propose
an optimized training procedure to refine instance assignments by incorporating
a dedicated data augmentation. Our experiments suggest that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for radar-based panoptic segmentation.

Result: APL在细粒度数据集上显著提升了GCD框架的性能。

Conclusion: APL通过自适应部分发现和学习，有效平衡了判别性与泛化性，为GCD任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize unlabeled images from
known and novel classes by distinguishing novel classes from known ones, while
also transferring knowledge from another set of labeled images with known
classes. Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such
as DINO for representation learning. However, focusing solely on the global
representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between
discriminability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive
part discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent
object parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a
set of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring
any additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min
contrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation,
which adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar
categories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other
parts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization. Our APL can
easily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS
token feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements
on fine-grained datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中国书法字符的属性信息（如风格、朝代和书法家）具有重要文化和历史价值，但现有数据集稀缺且缺乏属性标注，阻碍了深入研究。

Method: 构建了包含7,765类329,715个书法字符图像的MCCD数据集，并提取了基于脚本风格、朝代和书法家的三个子集。

Result: 实验表明，书法字符的笔画结构和属性间的相互作用增加了准确识别的难度。

Conclusion: MCCD填补了详细书法数据集的空白，为书法研究和多领域发展提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Research on the attribute information of calligraphy, such as styles,
dynasties, and calligraphers, holds significant cultural and historical value.
However, the styles of Chinese calligraphy characters have evolved dramatically
through different dynasties and the unique touches of calligraphers, making it
highly challenging to accurately recognize these different characters and their
attributes. Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,
and most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute
information. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of
Chinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute
Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765
categories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese
calligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on
the attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),
dynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich
multi-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,
including calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and
evolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance
through single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all
of its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the
stroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between
their different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty
of accurate recognition. MCCD not only fills a void in the availability of
detailed calligraphy datasets but also provides valuable resources for
advancing research in Chinese calligraphy and fostering advancements in
multiple fields. The dataset is available at

Method: 使用深度学习模型识别卫星图像中的棕榈树，结合聚类算法分析棕榈树集群，进而估计古代人类管理区域。

Result: 棕榈树在考古遗址附近显著更多，表明古代人类管理区域可能比考古证据显示的大两个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了人工智能与生态、考古数据结合揭示人类环境互动的潜力，为考古研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Ancient populations markedly transformed Neotropical forests, yet
understanding the long-term effects of ancient human management, particularly
at high-resolution scales, remains challenging. In this work we propose a new
approach to investigate archaeological areas of influence based on vegetation
signatures. It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery
to identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm
clusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess
the palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the
proposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765
km2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also
release a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations
of archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results
demonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological
sites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm
cluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major
infrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated
by archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian
populations influenced local vegetation fostering conditions conducive to palm
proliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered
the logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in
otherwise less accessible locations. Overall, this study demonstrates the
potential of integrating artificial intelligence approaches with new ecological
and archaeological data to identify archaeological areas of interest through
vegetation patterns, revealing fine-scale human-environment interactions.

Method: 采用逐步细化的配准和分割（ProRSeg）方法，使用加权分割一致性损失训练262对3T MR模拟扫描数据，并在同领域、跨领域和混合领域数据集上测试性能。

Result: ProRSeg在膀胱配准中表现出跨领域的泛化能力（DSC 0.88-0.86），而在直肠和CTV中性能依赖领域。剂量累积结果显示83.3%的患者满足CTV覆盖和膀胱保护约束。

Conclusion: ProRSeg在多领域MR-MR配准中表现合理，初步展示了其在评估临床约束治疗依从性中的可行性。

Abstract: Background: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is required for
contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy
(MRgART). This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for
domain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined
registration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T
MR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation
consistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR
Linac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour
propagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose
accumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.
Results: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice
Similarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,
performance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL
dataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain
performance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose
accumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95
>= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients
achieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under
upper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain
MR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary
feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.

Abstract: Insects comprise millions of species, many experiencing severe population
declines under environmental and habitat changes. High-throughput approaches
are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA
barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic
taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on
individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in
large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample
Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic
classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging
data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual
specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two
tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual
arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining
the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of
bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of
insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection
and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine
learning research.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在开放世界图像识别中表现优异，但在实际应用中因域偏移和分布变化而受限。传统测试时适应方法依赖昂贵训练或不现实的假设，FreeTTA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FreeTTA提出了一种无需训练的在线EM算法，利用视觉语言模型的零样本预测作为先验，迭代计算测试样本的后验概率并更新参数，无需同时访问历史数据。

Result: 在15个数据集的跨域和分布外实验中，FreeTTA相比现有方法实现了稳定且显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: FreeTTA首次明确建模测试数据分布，利用样本间内在关系提升预测性能，为测试时适应提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image
recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet, their effectiveness
in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional
changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.
Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the
use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample
predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA
methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or
make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and
test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and
universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the
flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model
the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among
test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous
access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages
by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from
VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each
online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA
achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution
settings.

Conclusion: DenoiseCP-Net为恶劣天气下的集体感知提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: While automated vehicles hold the potential to significantly reduce traffic
accidents, their perception systems remain vulnerable to sensor degradation
caused by adverse weather and environmental occlusions. Collective perception,
which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to
overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in
adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of
LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present
a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under
adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception
capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due
to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior
to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose
DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective
perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates
voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse
convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with
two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and
computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing
non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating
rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We
demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in
adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while
maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for
cooperative vehicles.

Abstract: Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer
diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning
have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI
face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to
subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology
captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce
a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from
histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor
generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically
clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting
representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph
by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and
apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The
aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space
through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large
language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric
datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for
classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569
for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms
state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for
microscopy based patient diagnosis.

Abstract: The rapid development of digital pathology and modern deep learning has
facilitated the emergence of pathology foundation models that are expected to
solve general pathology problems under various disease conditions in one
unified model, with or without fine-tuning. In parallel, spatial
transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the
profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology
images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive
into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this
work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict
cellular composition directly from H&E-stained histology images by leveraging
information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology
foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method
efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and
demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from
histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial
transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to
existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational
complexity.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation as an efficient knowledge transfer technique, has
achieved remarkable success in unimodal scenarios. However, in cross-modal
settings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges
due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the
complementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This
paper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:
distillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,
we propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
featuring a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse
ensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal
configurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that
facilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively
transcends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and
static teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,
independently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and
reconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and
enhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse
multimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge
distillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks. The source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过整合上下文元数据（如GPS、时间戳和食物信息）提升大型多模态模型（LMMs）在营养分析中的表现，并引入了新数据集ACETADA。实验表明，元数据整合能显著降低预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估专有模型（如GPT-4），忽略了其他LLMs的潜力，且上下文元数据与推理修饰符的交互影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过整合GPS、时间戳和食物信息等元数据，结合多种推理修饰符（如Chain-of-Thought），评估八种LMMs在营养分析中的表现。

Result: 整合元数据能显著降低预测营养值的平均绝对误差（MAE）和平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的LMMs在营养分析中具有显著潜力，未来可进一步探索其应用。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for
nutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary
models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored.
Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its
interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This
work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS
coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into
meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in
estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories,
macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also
introduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This
open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and
serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs
(four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of
contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images
alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information
enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought,
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona.
Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied
through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted
nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs
for improved nutrition analysis.

TL;DR: RulerNet是一种深度学习框架，通过将标尺读数统一为关键点检测问题，并结合几何级数参数表示，解决了像素测量转换为实际尺寸的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机视觉中，将像素测量转换为实际尺寸是一个基础性挑战，限制了生物医学、法医学、营养分析和电子商务等关键应用的发展。

Method: RulerNet通过关键点检测和几何级数参数表示标尺，采用抗畸变标注和训练策略，并结合合成数据增强训练多样性。

Result: 实验表明，RulerNet在多样化标尺类型和成像条件下表现出色，能够高效、准确地估计尺度。

Conclusion: RulerNet作为一种通用测量工具，具有广泛的应用潜力，并可与其他视觉组件集成，实现自动化、尺度感知的分析。

Abstract: Accurately converting pixel measurements into absolute real-world dimensions
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and limits progress in key
applications such as biomedicine, forensics, nutritional analysis, and
e-commerce. We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly
infers scale "in the wild" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified
keypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with
geometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective
transformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds
or rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter
marks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling
strong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while
mitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline
that combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add
photorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving
performance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a
lightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression
parameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling
real-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that
RulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under
challenging real-world conditions. These results underscore its utility as a
generalizable measurement tool and its potential for integration with other
vision components for automated, scale-aware analysis in high-impact domains. A

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的自动评估方法L-VQAScore，用于解决文本到图像生成模型中实体-属性语义评估的局限性，通过结合视觉定位和VQA技术，显著提升了评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型的评估方法在复杂组合生成（如时尚领域）中存在局限性，尤其是在实体-属性语义的评估上，容易出现属性混淆问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于视觉问答（VQA）定位策略的方法，结合视觉定位和VQA技术，开发了新的自动评估指标L-VQAScore，专注于单个实体的属性生成评估。

Result: 在新构建的数据集上，L-VQAScore在与人评估的相关性上优于现有方法，能够更准确地捕捉细粒度的实体-属性关联。

Conclusion: L-VQAScore是一种可靠且可扩展的评估方法，有望替代主观评估，提升文本到图像生成模型的评估效果。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
evaluation remains challenging in domains like fashion, involving complex
compositional generation. Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage
pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However,
our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich
entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e.,
when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To
address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization
strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual
modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a
novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual
localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized
(leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring
challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms
state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human
judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained
entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and
scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于文本描述生成多样化自然人体运动序列的方法，通过构建大规模数据集和评估框架，实现了零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在零样本泛化能力上存在不足，且缺乏全面的评估框架，阻碍了任务的发展。

Method: 开发高效标注流程，构建MotionMillion数据集（最大人体运动数据集），提出MotionMillion-Eval评估基准，并采用可扩展架构训练7B参数模型。

Result: 模型在MotionMillion-Eval上表现出色，能够泛化到域外和复杂组合运动。

Conclusion: 该方法为零样本人体运动生成迈出了重要一步，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generating diverse and natural human motion sequences based on textual
descriptions constitutes a fundamental and challenging research area within the
domains of computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements in this field, current methodologies often face challenges
regarding zero-shot generalization capabilities, largely attributable to the
limited size of training datasets. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive
evaluation framework impedes the advancement of this task by failing to
identify directions for improvement. In this work, we aim to push
text-to-motion into a new era, that is, to achieve the generalization ability
of zero-shot. To this end, firstly, we develop an efficient annotation pipeline
and introduce MotionMillion-the largest human motion dataset to date, featuring
over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences. Additionally, we
propose MotionMillion-Eval, the most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
zero-shot motion generation. Leveraging a scalable architecture, we scale our
model to 7B parameters and validate its performance on MotionMillion-Eval. Our
results demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex
compositional motions, marking a significant step toward zero-shot human motion
generation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VLV的自动编码器框架，通过利用预训练组件（视觉编码器、T2I扩散模型解码器和LLM）减少训练成本，实现高效视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型需要大量高质量图像-文本对和GPU资源，成本高昂。VLV框架旨在通过利用现有预训练模型减少数据需求和训练成本。

Method: 通过冻结预训练的T2I扩散解码器建立信息瓶颈，利用连续嵌入从扩散模型中提取知识，并微调LLM生成详细描述。

Result: VLV框架在保持高性能的同时，显著降低了训练成本（低于1000美元），并减少了对大规模配对数据的需求。

Conclusion: VLV框架提供了一种高效、低成本的视觉语言模型训练方法，性能媲美主流模型如GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Abstract: Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong
captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of
high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper
introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which
strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the
decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large
Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by
regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the
pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills
knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous
embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality
reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the
intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct
a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o
and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and
significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal
images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models
(image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for
massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure
under $1,000 USD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了使用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型作为视觉编码器的潜力，以弥补CLIP在捕捉细粒度细节上的不足，并提出了一种融合策略来提升视觉问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉问答中常忽略细粒度细节，因此研究扩散模型是否能作为更有效的视觉编码器。

Method: 分析扩散模型的内部表示，利用其语义丰富性和图像-文本对齐能力，结合文本条件聚焦问题相关区域，并与大语言模型对齐。提出了一种融合CLIP和扩散特征的策略。

Result: 在通用VQA和专用MLLM基准测试中，扩散模型表现出色，尤其在需要空间和组合推理的视觉中心任务中。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在视觉理解任务中具有潜力，特别是在需要细粒度分析的场景中，融合策略能有效提升性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the
use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global
information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the
input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware
visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find
diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text
alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus
the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to
align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage
phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the
original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a
mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion
strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We
evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,
demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,
particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional
reasoning. Our project page can be found

### [95] [Humans overrely on overconfident language models, across languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06306)
*Neil Rathi,Dan Jurafsky,Kaitlyn Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）在多语言环境中存在过度自信和用户过度依赖的问题，不同语言中不确定性标记的使用和解读差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在全球范围内的安全性，特别是其在不同语言中的校准问题，以避免用户对模型输出的过度依赖。

Method: 分析五种语言中LLM生成的认识标记分布，并测量用户在不同语言中对模型输出的依赖行为。

Result: LLM在所有语言中均表现出过度自信，但能敏感捕捉语言差异；用户在所有语言中均高度依赖自信输出，但依赖行为因语言而异。

Conclusion: 多语言校准面临挑战，需结合文化和语言背景进行模型安全性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that
their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey
uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are
linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident
generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,
'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we
study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,
and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a
global context.
  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first
analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that
while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to
documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers
of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and
Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that
while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,
reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely
significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.
Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident
model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of
multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and
linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

*Kiarash Zahirnia,Zahra Golpayegani,Walid Ahmad,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ETT方法，通过高效微调短上下文Transformer模型的参数，以线性计算开销和恒定内存需求扩展上下文长度，提升模型在长序列任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的计算和内存开销随序列长度呈二次增长，限制了其在长序列任务中的应用。

Method: ETT方法通过在测试时对输入上下文的子序列进行微调，扩展上下文长度，同时保持计算和内存效率。

Result: 在LongBench上，ETT将GPT-Large和Phi-2的上下文长度从1k扩展到32k，准确率提升30%。

Conclusion: ETT有效扩展了上下文长度，且仅微调部分模块（如FFN的第二层）比全微调效果更好。

Abstract: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase
quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses
challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we
introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the
context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory
requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the
context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on
the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT
on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32
times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent
improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in
LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study,
we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at
test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs
is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in
the models' accuracy.

Motivation: 动机在于结合形式、分布和接地语义理论的优点，以弥补各自的不足，并通过视觉知识和符号方法丰富语言模型。

Method: 方法包括回顾相关文献，借鉴认知科学的最新研究，进行小规模实验，并提出基于“词作为分类器”的统一语义模型。

Result: 结果表明“词作为分类器”模型在对话环境中表现良好，并能有效结合多种语义理论。

Conclusion: 结论认为“词作为分类器”模型是统一形式、分布和接地语义理论的有前景的路径。

Abstract: Formal, Distributional, and Grounded theories of computational semantics each
have their uses and their drawbacks. There has been a shift to ground models of
language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models
of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal,
distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the
case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is
paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded
semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional
language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within
interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the
words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science,
and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics
unified through words-as-classifiers.

*Catherine Arnett,Marisa Hudspeth,Brendan O'Connor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文扩展了MorphScore以评估70种语言的tokenizer质量，发现形态对齐对模型性能影响有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何有效评估tokenizer质量，特别是其是否保留语言学的有意义子词。

Method: 扩展MorphScore至70种语言，并分析形态对齐分数与下游任务性能的相关性。

Result: 形态对齐对模型性能的方差解释有限，表明其单独不足以衡量tokenizer质量。

Conclusion: 形态对齐并非衡量tokenizer质量的关键维度，需进一步探索其他因素。

Abstract: While tokenization is a key step in language modeling, with effects on model
training and performance, it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate
tokenizer quality. One proposed dimension of tokenizer quality is the extent to
which tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords, aligning token
boundaries with morphological boundaries within a word. We expand MorphScore
(Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a
total of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in
evaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We
then correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five
pre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of
the languages in our sample. We find that morphological alignment does not
explain very much variance in model performance, suggesting that morphological
alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to
model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究句法结构的数学形式化，特别是头部函数和操作ad在句法生成中的作用。

Method: 使用超岩浆结构和彩色操作ad来描述句法对象的生成和过滤，并分析其与句法规则的关系。

Result: 证明了句法结构和规则可以通过彩色操作ad的形式化表示，并统一了多种句法原则。

Conclusion: 彩色操作ad为句法结构的数学建模提供了统一框架，能够涵盖多种句法现象和规则。

Abstract: We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure
to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma
operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma. We then show that the
structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions,
and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a
bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure
of theta roles. We also show that, due to the special form of the colored
operad generators, the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these
coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of
structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the
hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to
phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase
Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad
generators. Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta
roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored
operads and a transduction of colored operads.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERK提出了一种参数高效的方法，通过梯度更新轻量级适配器在测试时编码长上下文，显著提升了长上下文推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有元学习方法在长上下文推理中内存消耗过大的问题。

Method: 采用双嵌套优化循环，内循环快速编码上下文到低秩适配器，外循环学习利用适配器进行推理。

Result: 在多个长上下文任务中显著优于基线，性能提升高达90%（小模型）和27%（大模型）。

Conclusion: PERK在训练时内存消耗大，但在推理时更高效，且对推理复杂性、长度外推和信息位置更鲁棒。

Abstract: Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information
in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using
test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can
effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning
methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,
preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose
PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for
learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight
model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization
loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a
low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for
the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter
to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long
context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK
significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,
achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models
(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In
general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and
the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while
PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at
inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类偏好的复杂性和数据集的有限覆盖，奖励模型在分布偏移或对抗扰动下容易失效。现有方法依赖先验知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了一种不依赖偏好分布的先验知识的方法，通过奖励引导的解码发现失败模式，并利用REFORM框架生成对抗样本以改进训练数据。

Result: 在Anthropic HH和PKU Beavertails数据集上，REFORM显著提升了鲁棒性，同时保持了奖励质量，并在下游策略训练中表现良好。

Conclusion: REFORM通过自我改进机制有效提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性和对齐质量，消除了虚假相关性。

Abstract: Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large
language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model
finetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent
complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,
reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial
perturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically
rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,
limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is
unavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution
agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided
controlled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving
reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model
itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial
examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward
model's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference
datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate
that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.
Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in
downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing
spurious correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型被视为黑箱，缺乏透明性，影响了信任度和下游任务性能的提升。

Method: 采用字典学习和稀疏自编码器的方法分解LLM，提取单义特征并自动优化提示。

Result: 方法显著提高了数学推理和隐喻检测等下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解LLM提升了模型透明性和任务性能，为改进模型理解提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are traditionally viewed as black-box
algorithms, therefore reducing trustworthiness and obscuring potential
approaches to increasing performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we
apply an effective LLM decomposition method using a dictionary-learning
approach with sparse autoencoders. This helps extract monosemantic features
from polysemantic LLM neurons. Remarkably, our work identifies model-internal
misunderstanding, allowing the automatic reformulation of the prompts with
additional annotations to improve the interpretation by LLMs. Moreover, this
approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement in downstream
tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and metaphor detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估全球对复杂挑战（如气候变化）的响应需要理解政策语言的演变，传统方法效率低且难以捕捉复杂性。

Method: 应用动态嵌入主题模型（DETM）分析1995-2023年UNFCCC政策决策的语料库，排除2020年数据。

Result: 模型显示政策主题从温室气体转向实施、技术合作、资金等，DETM被证明是有效的分析工具。

Conclusion: DETM可扩展用于其他政策领域，未来将进一步优化和扩展。

Abstract: Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing
global responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal
analysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to
evaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance
strategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as
manual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the
complex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing
relevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,
particularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.
In this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded
topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.
A probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over
time. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PAPO的方法，通过改进RLVR框架，增强了多模态推理任务中的视觉感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR在多模态推理任务中表现不佳，主要问题在于视觉输入的感知能力不足。

Method: 提出PAPO方法，通过引入隐式感知损失（KL散度项）优化GRPO目标，无需额外数据或外部模型。

Result: PAPO在多模态基准测试中提升了4.4%，视觉依赖任务中提升近8.0%，感知错误减少30.5%。

Conclusion: PAPO为RLVR框架提供了更深的感知监督，为视觉推理奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a
highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust
multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain
tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when
applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major
source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of
visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy
Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages
the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal
supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,
external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the
Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO
objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall
improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more
pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also
observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating
improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis
of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze
and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a
deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning
objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages
visually grounded reasoning. Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/PAPO.

*Xin Su,Sungduk Yu,Phillip Howard,Steven Bethard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将时间规范化任务转化为代码生成任务的新方法，基于SCATE框架，利用大语言模型生成可执行代码，并通过数据增强提升小模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于ISO-TimeML的系统表达能力有限，难以处理复杂时间表达式，如组合式、事件相对和多跨度表达式。

Method: 将时间规范化任务重新定义为基于SCATE框架的代码生成任务，开发了可执行的SCATE Python库，并利用大语言模型生成可执行代码，通过数据增强生成大规模标注数据。

Result: 实验表明，基于增强数据训练的小型模型性能优于其父模型（大语言模型），实现了高效、准确且可解释的时间规范化。

Conclusion: 该方法为时间规范化提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal
expressions into machine-readable representations. It underpins many downstream
applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical
decision-making. Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit
expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional,
event-relative, and multi-span time expressions. In this work, we introduce a
novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in
the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and
compositional operators. We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library
and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE
code. Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation
pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level
validation. Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained
on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their
LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time
normalization.

TL;DR: 论文研究了线性注意力机制在Transformer中的应用，发现优秀的独立线性模型在混合架构中未必表现最佳，并推荐了高效的混合架构比例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在处理长序列时的二次复杂性和内存问题，同时提升线性注意力模型的召回性能。

Method: 系统评估了多种线性注意力模型，包括独立和混合架构，训练并开源了72个模型进行对比分析。

Result: 语言建模性能稳定，但召回性能随全注意力层比例增加而提升，推荐3:1至6:1的线性-全注意力比例。

Conclusion: 选择性门控、分层递归和可控遗忘对混合模型至关重要，推荐HGRN-2或GatedDeltaNet架构。

Abstract: Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences,
prompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden
states. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,
leading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.
Despite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention
component has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various
linear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced
gating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this
comprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M
parameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six
linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on
standard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone
linear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling
remains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly
improves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio.
Our study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled
forgetting as critical for effective hybrid models. We recommend architectures
such as HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a linear-to-full ratio between 3:1 and 6:1
to achieve Transformer-level recall efficiently. Our models are open-sourced at

Motivation: 确保LLM在人类-AI交互中的透明性、信任和安全性，特别是在高风险应用中。

Method: 引入基于扰动和越狱方法的攻击框架，测试不同提示策略、模型规模和应用领域。

Result: 攻击显著危害置信度估计并导致频繁答案更改，现有防御技术无效或适得其反。

Conclusion: 亟需设计更鲁棒的置信度表达机制，因为即使是微小的语义保留修改也可能导致误导性置信度。

Abstract: Robust verbal confidence generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for the deployment of LLMs to ensure transparency, trust, and safety in
human-AI interactions across many high-stakes applications. In this paper, we
present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence
under adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel framework for attacking verbal
confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and
show that these attacks can significantly jeopardize verbal confidence
estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of
prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that
current confidence elicitation methods are vulnerable and that commonly used
defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings
underscore the urgent need to design more robust mechanisms for confidence
expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead
to misleading confidence in responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨语言双关语翻译的挑战，捕捉源文本的语言创造力和幽默，而非简单词汇复制。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：基线模型、引导思维链管道和多代理生成-判别框架。

Result: 在CLEF JOKER 2025竞赛中获第一和第二名。

Conclusion: 填补了翻译研究与计算语言学之间的空白，推进了语言模型处理语义模糊性和文化意识的能力。

Abstract: Translating wordplay across languages presents unique challenges that have
long confounded both professional human translators and machine translation
systems. This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from
English to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with
specialized techniques for wordplay generation.
  Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a
baseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a
new contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided
chain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we
implement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and
regenerating puns with feedback.
  Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's
primary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the
source text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best
runs earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition
where they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.
  This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational
linguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay
translation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be
leveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic
similarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for
successful humor.

Result: InvestAlign生成的数据训练LLMs参数收敛更快，InvestAgent在简单和复杂投资问题中更接近真实用户数据。

Conclusion: InvestAlign是解决复杂投资问题和LLMs对齐的有前景方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes
under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which
grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed
for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM
outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data
imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign,
a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging
theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather
than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training
LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than
using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we
develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which
demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT
models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our
proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address
complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor
decision-making processes under herd behavior. Our code is publicly available

TL;DR: SpindleKV是一种新型的KV缓存减少方法，通过平衡浅层和深层的处理策略，有效减少了LLMs推理时的内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs推理时KV缓存的内存消耗问题日益突出，现有方法在浅层缓存减少上效果不足。

Method: SpindleKV结合了基于注意力权重的深层缓存淘汰方法和基于代码本的浅层缓存替换方法，解决了GQA问题。

Result: 实验表明，SpindleKV在减少KV缓存的同时保持了模型性能，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SpindleKV为LLMs推理系统的内存优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in
recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has
possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods
have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its
potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache
reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our
observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on
this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV,
which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an
attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a
codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging
policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma
faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common
benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV
cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar
or even better model performance.

Motivation: 数据提取阶段资源密集，研究者希望通过在线大语言模型（LLM）和审查协议加速这一过程。

Method: 使用Claude 3.5 Sonnet和审查协议对10个证据源进行数据提取，并对提取的数据进行审查。

Result: 简单数据提取准确率高（83.3%和100%），复杂数据提取准确率低（9.6%和15.8%）。总体精度>90%，但召回率和F1分数较低。

Conclusion: 需要更全面的性能评估，建议研究者在类似场景中评估并报告LLM表现，同时LLM反馈有助于协议改进。

Abstract: The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers
may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs
and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that
used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources
included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also
used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken
which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%)
when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6%
and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all
data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1
scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and
methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and
misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate
and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of
38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value.
However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors,
only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for
expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs
and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering
approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if
using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM
feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review
protocol drafting.

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex

large language model based on this dataset. Firstly, cluster analysis is
performed on industrial contract texts, and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are used to
extract key information from the original contract data, obtaining high-quality
data annotations. Secondly, data augmentation is achieved by constructing new
texts, and GPT-3.5 generates unstructured contract texts from randomly combined
keywords, improving model robustness. Finally, the large language model is
fine-tuned based on the high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that
the model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field
recall and precision and considering parsing efficiency. LoRA, data balancing,
and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness. The
proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for industrial contract
information extraction tasks.

Method: 开发了讨论网络模型，定义四种无效性风险（漂移、自我修复、新编造、外部检测），并提出开源算法FOO实现同行评审。

Result: 网络仅依赖漂移和自我修复时，错误率较低；加入编造后错误率升高；引入同行评审可显著提升系统真实性。

Conclusion: 信息可靠性依赖于将不完美的模型网络化，通过相互监督保持诚实。

Abstract: Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and
software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that
treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements
circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define
invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows
four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external
detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to
provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair
stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates
seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer
review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer
review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a
configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a
harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural:
reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from
wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large improves
BERTScore by 16.2\%, reduces FID by 37.8\%, and boosts CLIP alignment by
31.1\%. Diagnostic analyses-CLIP-based mismatch detection (35.2\% to 7.3\%) and

Motivation: 研究旨在量化政治精英之间的相互敌意（精英极化），以更好地理解政治动态。

Method: 利用AI检测议会演讲中的发言者和被提及者，并评估情感温度，构建精英极化指数。

Result: 研究结果显示，该指数对选举活动、政党危机等事件反应良好，并可按政党和季度汇总。

Conclusion: 该方法为长期监测欧盟范围内的精英极化提供了基础，且指数具有较高的表面效度。

Abstract: This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and
subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians
mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is
being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations.
This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create
an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I
analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two
decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a
twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the
results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index
demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral
campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming
power.

Conclusion: GMU和SambaY架构为高效序列建模提供了新思路，展示了在大规模计算环境下的优越性能扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of
State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid
architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have
shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not
investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM
layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet
effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to
create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in
the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based
self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves
linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all
while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive
scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly
lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior
performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model
enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves
significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks
such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement
learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length
prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床文本生成中数据非结构化和语义密度高的问题，确保生成内容与临床需求一致。

Method: 引入分层分块策略和双阶段检索机制（全局阶段识别相关笔记类型，局部阶段提取高价值内容）。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，生成的结构化进度笔记平均对齐分数达87.7%，优于临床医生撰写的笔记（80.7%）。

Conclusion: CLI-RAG框架在临床文本生成中表现出色，具有高一致性和可靠性，适合临床应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms,
have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However,
real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly
unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2)
clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting
infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting
clinically relevant information.
  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a
domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text
generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy
that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific
dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types
using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content
within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.
  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual
hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset.
Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across
visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7%
baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also
demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior
essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成的高维嵌入在领域特定应用中过于通用或低效的问题。

Conclusion: FuDoBa能有效提升分类性能，同时降低训练复杂度并增强可解释性。

Abstract: Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
representations have dominated the document representation landscape, achieving
great performance on the document embedding benchmarks. However, the
high-dimensional, computationally expensive embeddings from LLMs tend to be
either too generic or inefficient for domain-specific applications. To address
these limitations, we introduce FuDoBa a Bayesian optimisation-based method
that integrates LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific structured knowledge,
sourced both locally and from external repositories like WikiData. This fusion
produces low-dimensional, task-relevant representations while reducing training
complexity and yielding interpretable early-fusion weights for enhanced
classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
six datasets in two domains, showing that when paired with robust AutoML-based
classifiers, our proposed representation learning approach performs on par
with, or surpasses, those produced solely by the proprietary LLM-based
embedding baselines.

*Sunwoo Kim,Haneul Yoo,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在内部如何处理不确定性，发现不确定性和确定性预测在层间概率轨迹上高度一致，挑战了简单检测不确定性的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何内部表示和处理不确定性，以检测不确定性并防止幻觉。

Method: 使用Tuned Lens（Logit Lens的变体）分析11个数据集和5个模型的层间概率轨迹，比较确定性和不确定性预测的动态。

Result: 确定性和不确定性预测的层间概率轨迹高度一致，不确定性并未显著影响推理动态。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，简单方法检测不确定性可能不可行，并展示了可解释性方法在研究不确定性影响推理中的应用。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) internally represent and
process their predictions is central to detecting uncertainty and preventing
hallucinations. While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty
in their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they
process such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of
output token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are
largely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference
dynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to
analyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens
across 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with
higher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain
and uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at
similar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent
models may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the
feasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at
inference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may
be used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.

Conclusion: KAConvText-MLP结合微调fastText嵌入在句子分类任务中表现优异，且KAN分类头提升了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolution
for Text (KAConvText) in sentence classification, addressing three tasks:
imbalanced binary hate speech detection, balanced multiclass news
classification, and imbalanced multiclass ethnic language identification. We
investigate various embedding configurations, comparing random to fastText
embeddings in both static and fine-tuned settings, with embedding dimensions of
100 and 300 using CBOW and Skip-gram models. Baselines include standard CNNs
and CNNs augmented with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CNN-KAN). In addition, we
investigated KAConvText with different classification heads - MLP and KAN,
where using KAN head supports enhanced interpretability. Results show that
KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best
performance of 91.23% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9109) for hate speech detection,
92.66% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82%
accuracy (F1-score = 0.9982) for language identification.

Motivation: 自动化文本评估是NLP的核心问题，但现有方法在跨语言任务中成本高且效率低。

Method: 提出CE-Judge框架，基于开源模型和清单直觉，无需训练即可进行多语言评估。

Result: 在多种语言和基准数据集上的实验表明，CE-Judge性能优于基线模型，与GPT-4o相当。

Conclusion: CE-Judge为多语言文本评估提供了一种高效、低成本且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language
Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While
promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited
exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely
on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning,
raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose
Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free
framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an
open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark
datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method
generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

TL;DR: 研究验证了基于DACP的方法在小型LLMs上的有效性，证明其能显著提升目标领域性能，同时保持通用能力，为企业部署提供高效解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大型语言模型（LLMs）的兴起为企业应用提供了机会，但许多组织缺乏部署和维护大规模模型的基础设施，因此小型LLMs（sLLMs）成为实用替代方案。然而，领域自适应持续预训练（DACP）在商业应用中的实用性尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过在不同基础模型和服务领域应用基于DACP的方法，进行广泛实验和实际评估。

Result: 实验表明，应用DACP的sLLMs在目标领域性能上有显著提升，同时保持了通用能力。

Conclusion: DACP方法为小型LLMs提供了一种成本高效且可扩展的企业级部署解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded
opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still
lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result,
small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent
performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has
been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in
commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the
effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models
and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations,
we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target
domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a
cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，适用于多种系统和领域，显著提升建模效率。

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of
engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and
expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational
model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of
interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is
implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language
diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies,
attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to
improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such
as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and
key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram
generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is
illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex
dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and
computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP
strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only.
The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or
computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via
an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved
performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

Motivation: 现有顺序推理和并行推理方法存在效率低或缺乏协调的问题，需设计更灵活的推理框架。

Method: 提出协作推理框架，利用语义熵（SE）评估推理质量，实现动态控制和早期终止。

Result: 语义熵（SE）与准确性呈强负相关，可作为推理质量的鲁棒指标。

Conclusion: 该框架结合了顺序和并行推理的优势，通过SE实现了高效的动态推理控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress
toward artificial general intelligence, with inference-time scaling emerging as
a key technique. Contemporary approaches leverage either sequential reasoning
(iteratively extending chains of thought) or parallel reasoning (generating
multiple solutions simultaneously) to scale inference. However, both paradigms
face fundamental limitations: sequential scaling typically relies on arbitrary
token budgets for termination, leading to inefficiency or premature cutoff;
while parallel scaling often lacks coordination among parallel branches and
requires intrusive fine-tuning to perform effectively. In light of these
challenges, we aim to design a flexible test-time collaborative inference
framework that exploits the complementary strengths of both sequential and
parallel reasoning paradigms. Towards this goal, the core challenge lies in
developing an efficient and accurate intrinsic quality metric to assess model
responses during collaborative inference, enabling dynamic control and early
termination of the reasoning trace. To address this challenge, we introduce
semantic entropy (SE), which quantifies the semantic diversity of parallel
model responses and serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality due to
its strong negative correlation with accuracy...

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅基于段落个体相关性重新排序，难以满足复杂查询的需求。

Method: 提出SETR方法，通过Chain-of-Thought推理识别查询需求，并选择最优段落集合。

Result: 在多跳RAG基准测试中，SETR在答案正确性和检索质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SETR为RAG系统提供了一种高效且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved
passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a
comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on
their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of
complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a
set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly
identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought
reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy
those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR
outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in
terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and
efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems. The code is

Abstract: AI evaluations have become critical tools for assessing large language model
capabilities and safety. This paper presents practical insights from eight
months of maintaining $inspect\_evals$, an open-source repository of 70+
community-contributed AI evaluations. We identify key challenges in
implementing and maintaining AI evaluations and develop solutions including:
(1) a structured cohort management framework for scaling community
contributions, (2) statistical methodologies for optimal resampling and
cross-model comparison with uncertainty quantification, and (3) systematic
quality control processes for reproducibility. Our analysis reveals that AI
evaluation requires specialized infrastructure, statistical rigor, and
community coordination beyond traditional software development practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决知识图谱（KG）增强中对噪声鲁棒且适应性强的关系抽取（RE）需求，尤其是在低监督环境下。

Method: 采用监督对比学习和贝叶斯kNN分类器进行多标签分类，无需微调预训练语言模型（PLM）。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，SCoRE性能优于或匹配现有方法，同时显著降低能耗。

Conclusion: SCoRE因其高效、模块化和可扩展性，成为实际RE应用的理想选择。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient knowledge graph (KG) enrichment leveraging
external corpora has intensified interest in relation extraction (RE),
particularly under low-supervision settings. To address the need for adaptable
and noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained
large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective
sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no
finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining
supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance
despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE
evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),
measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,
and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also
release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where
only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show
that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model
complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the
advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and
scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

Method: 提出VisualTrap方法，通过污染预训练数据误导视觉定位，攻击具有隐蔽性和泛化性。

Result: 实验证明，仅需5%污染数据即可高效攻击，且攻击可跨GUI环境迁移。

Conclusion: GUI代理的后门攻击风险亟需进一步研究。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine
interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile
phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks
in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices
raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor
attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual
grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce
vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack
targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when
given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose
VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to
locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.
VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and
does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical
feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can
effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and
highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack
can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,
the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,
e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.
These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor
attack risks in GUI agents.

Result: 在三个模因数据集上，MIND优于现有零样本方法，且在不同模型架构和参数规模下表现优异。

Conclusion: MIND为有害模因检测提供了可扩展的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need
for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional
data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving
nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we
propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that
does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We
retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual
information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to
extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a
multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned
arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also
shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter
scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection. The code is

Conclusion: 多被告和多罪名的复杂性对法律判决预测有显著影响，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction offers a compelling method to aid legal
practitioners and researchers. However, the research question remains
relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated
separately in LJP? To address this, we introduce a new dataset namely
multi-person multi-charge prediction (MPMCP), and seek the answer by evaluating
the performance of several prevailing legal large language models (LLMs) on
four practical legal judgment scenarios: (S1) single defendant with a single
charge, (S2) single defendant with multiple charges, (S3) multiple defendants
with a single charge, and (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges. We
evaluate the dataset across two LJP tasks, i.e., charge prediction and penalty
term prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments and found that the
scenario involving multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) poses the
greatest challenges, followed by S2, S3, and S1. The impact varies
significantly depending on the model. For example, in S4 compared to S1,
InternLM2 achieves approximately 4.5% lower F1-score and 2.8% higher LogD,
while Lawformer demonstrates around 19.7% lower F1-score and 19.0% higher LogD.

Method: 使用两种数学辅导对话数据集，评估Llama 3和GPT-4o预测导师策略和学生表现的能力。

Result: 即使最先进的LLMs也难以准确预测导师策略，但导师策略对学生表现有显著影响。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的方法来预测导师策略及其对学生表现的影响。

Abstract: Tutoring dialogues have gained significant attention in recent years, given
the prominence of online learning and the emerging tutoring abilities of
artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models (LLMs).
Recent studies have shown that the strategies used by tutors can have
significant effects on student outcomes, necessitating methods to predict how
tutors will behave and how their actions impact students. However, few works
have studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we
investigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to
predict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two
math tutoring dialogue datasets. We find that even state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to predict future tutor strategy while tutor strategy is highly
indicative of student outcomes, outlining a need for more powerful methods to
approach this task.

Conclusion: SAGA为可靠的LLM代码评估提供了可扩展基础，推动了代码生成中RLVR的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in
code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a
detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a
limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going
undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also
compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks
utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we
systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing
multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite
thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method
(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,
aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated
test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the
TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a
verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)
of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%
higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building
a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR
in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis
and adaptive benchmark integration.

Result: 检索器性能在轻微查询变化下显著下降，实验结果为RAG系统改进提供了依据。

Conclusion: RAG系统对查询扰动敏感，需优化检索模块，提出的评估框架为实践者提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are very costly and inefficient to update with
new information. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external
knowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most
notably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate
retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different
components in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade
significantly even under minor query variations. We study each module in
isolation as well as their combined effect in an end-to-end question answering
setting, using both general-domain and domain-specific datasets. Additionally,
we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the query-level
robustness of RAG pipelines and offer actionable recommendations for
practitioners based on the results of more than 1092 experiments we performed.

Conclusion: FRaN-X是一个功能强大的工具，可用于媒体框架分析，并已公开提供使用。

Abstract: We present FRaN-X, a Framing and Narratives Explorer that automatically
detects entity mentions and classifies their narrative roles directly from raw
text. FRaN-X comprises a two-stage system that combines sequence labeling with
fine-grained role classification to reveal how entities are portrayed as
protagonists, antagonists, or innocents, using a unique taxonomy of 22
fine-grained roles nested under these three main categories. The system
supports five languages (Bulgarian, English, Hindi, Russian, and Portuguese)
and two domains (the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Climate Change). It provides
an interactive web interface for media analysts to explore and compare framing
across different sources, tackling the challenge of automatically detecting and
labeling how entities are framed. Our system allows end users to focus on a
single article as well as analyze up to four articles simultaneously. We
provide aggregate level analysis including an intuitive graph visualization
that highlights the narrative a group of articles are pushing. Our system
includes a search feature for users to look up entities of interest, along with
a timeline view that allows analysts to track an entity's role transitions
across different contexts within the article. The FRaN-X system and the trained
models are licensed under an MIT License. FRaN-X is publicly accessible at
https://fran-x.streamlit.app/ and a video demonstration is available at

TL;DR: FlexOlmo是一种新型语言模型，支持分布式训练和数据灵活推理，无需共享数据或额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在受监管行业中敏感数据无法共享的问题，同时允许数据所有者保持数据本地化并控制访问。

Method: 采用混合专家（MoE）架构，专家独立训练于封闭数据集，通过领域感知路由集成。

Result: 在31个任务上表现优异，平均提升41%，优于现有模型合并方法和标准MoE。

Conclusion: FlexOlmo为数据所有者和研究者提供了兼顾数据隐私和性能的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1)
distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are
independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference,
where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly
included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo
employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained
independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new
domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on
FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside
seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed
sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active)
on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public
data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other
data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing
users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission
requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by
10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data
restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents
a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with
sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while
respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting
fine-grained control of data access during inference.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational search systems revolutionizes how
information is accessed by enabling the multi-turn interaction between the user
and the system. Existing conversational search systems are usually built with
two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the
effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for
developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding
conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating
responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response
generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint
fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the
inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five
conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually
improve both tasks and outperform the existing baselines.

TL;DR: 扩散模型在连续数据领域表现出色，但在离散数据（如自然语言）上应用仍具挑战。本文研究了离散扩散模型（D3PM）在自然语言生成中的表现，并与传统自回归模型（AR）进行了比较。结果显示D3PM在并行生成速度上占优，但AR在压缩性能上更佳。


<details>

Motivation: 探索扩散模型在离散数据（如自然语言）上的可行性和性能，以解决传统自回归模型的局限性。

Method: 评估离散去噪扩散概率模型（D3PM）与传统自回归模型（AR），使用Bits Per Token（BPT）、Negative Log-Likelihood（NLL）、Perplexity（PPL）和Batch Processing Speed等指标。

Result: D3PM在并行生成速度上表现优异（3.97 batches/sec），但AR在压缩性能上更优（BPT均值4.59 vs D3PM的8.05）。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在离散数据生成中具有潜力，尤其在并行生成方面，但需进一步优化以提升生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and
video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process
that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,
followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful
in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly
natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and
the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility
and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.
Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To
assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative
Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.
  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a
mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of
4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches
per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were
conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with
a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a
detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting
trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the
promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting
future work in non-autoregressive language generation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文研究了资源受限的随机消歧路径（RDP）问题，提出了一种结合拉格朗日松弛和两阶段顶点消除（TPVE）的新算法框架COLOGR，以解决约束规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在空间环境中，导航代理需要在不确定障碍物的情况下到达目标，而消歧每个障碍物的资源成本可能不同且受全局预算限制。

Method: 将问题建模为带权约束的最短路径问题（WCSPP），提出COLOGR算法框架，结合拉格朗日松弛和TPVE，修剪不可行和次优路径。

Result: COLOGR在多种障碍物密度、传感器精度和风险模型下表现稳健，优于贪婪基线并接近离线最优基准。

Conclusion: COLOGR框架在随机网络设计、移动规划和不确定性下的约束决策中具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We study a resource-constrained variant of the Random Disambiguation Path
(RDP) problem, a generalization of the Stochastic Obstacle Scene (SOS) problem,
in which a navigating agent must reach a target in a spatial environment
populated with uncertain obstacles. Each ambiguous obstacle may be
disambiguated at a (possibly) heterogeneous resource cost, subject to a global
disambiguation budget. We formulate this constrained planning problem as a
Weight-Constrained Shortest Path Problem (WCSPP) with risk-adjusted edge costs
that incorporate probabilistic blockage and traversal penalties. To solve it,
we propose a novel algorithmic framework-COLOGR-combining Lagrangian relaxation
with a two-phase vertex elimination (TPVE) procedure. The method prunes
infeasible and suboptimal paths while provably preserving the optimal solution,
and leverages dual bounds to guide efficient search. We establish correctness,
feasibility guarantees, and surrogate optimality under mild assumptions. Our
analysis also demonstrates that COLOGR frequently achieves zero duality gap and
offers improved computational complexity over prior constrained path-planning
methods. Extensive simulation experiments validate the algorithm's robustness
across varying obstacle densities, sensor accuracies, and risk models,
consistently outperforming greedy baselines and approaching offline-optimal
benchmarks. The proposed framework is broadly applicable to stochastic network
design, mobility planning, and constrained decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for mapping underwater caves. Underwater
caves are crucial for fresh water resource management, underwater archaeology,
and hydrogeology. Mapping the cave's outline and dimensions, as well as
creating photorealistic 3D maps, is critical for enabling a better
understanding of this underwater domain. In this paper, we present the mapping
of an underwater cave segment (the catacombs) of the Devil's Eye cave system at
Ginnie Springs, FL. We utilized a set of inexpensive action cameras in
conjunction with a dive computer to estimate the trajectories of the cameras
together with a sparse point cloud. The resulting reconstructions are utilized
to produce a one-dimensional retract of the cave passages in the form of the
average trajectory together with the boundaries (top, bottom, left, and right).
The use of the dive computer enables the observability of the z-dimension in
addition to the roll and pitch in a visual/inertial framework (SVIn2). In
addition, the keyframes generated by SVIn2 together with the estimated camera
poses for select areas are used as input to a global optimization (bundle
adjustment) framework -- COLMAP -- in order to produce a dense reconstruction
of those areas. The same cave segment is manually surveyed using the MNemo V2
instrument, providing an additional set of measurements validating the proposed
approach. It is worth noting that with the use of action cameras, the primary
components of a cave map can be constructed. Furthermore, with the utilization
of a global optimization framework guided by the results of VI-SLAM package
SVIn2, photorealistic dense 3D representations of selected areas can be
reconstructed.

Abstract: Evaluating and comparing the performance of autonomous Humanoid Robots is
challenging, as success rate metrics are difficult to reproduce and fail to
capture the complexity of robot movement trajectories, critical in Human-Robot
Interaction and Collaboration (HRIC). To address these challenges, we propose a
general evaluation framework that measures the quality of Imitation Learning
(IL) methods by focusing on trajectory performance. We devise the Neural Meta
Evaluator (NeME), a deep learning model trained to classify actions from robot
joint trajectories. NeME serves as a meta-evaluator to compare the performance
of robot control policies, enabling policy evaluation without requiring human
involvement in the loop. We validate our framework on ergoCub, a humanoid
robot, using teleoperation data and comparing IL methods tailored to the
available platform. The experimental results indicate that our method is more
aligned with the success rate obtained on the robot than baselines, offering a
reproducible, systematic, and insightful means for comparing the performance of
multimodal imitation learning approaches in complex HRI tasks.

Method: 采用发展心理学的方法，系统设计强化学习训练方案，并在模拟环境中测试双足机器人Cassie的行为。

Result: 研究揭示了不同训练方案对机器人行为的具体影响，并与婴儿学步行为进行了比较。

Conclusion: 跨学科的婴儿-机器人研究方法为未来系统测试训练对复杂机器人行为发展的影响提供了新思路。

Abstract: Typically, learned robot controllers are trained via relatively unsystematic
regimens and evaluated with coarse-grained outcome measures such as average
cumulative reward. The typical approach is useful to compare learning
algorithms but provides limited insight into the effects of different training
regimens and little understanding about the richness and complexity of learned
behaviors. Likewise, human infants and other animals are "trained" via
unsystematic regimens, but in contrast, developmental psychologists evaluate
their performance in highly-controlled experiments with fine-grained measures
such as success, speed of walking, and prospective adjustments. However, the
study of learned behavior in human infants is limited by the practical
constraints of training and testing babies. Here, we present a case study that
applies methods from developmental psychology to study the learned behavior of
the simulated bipedal robot Cassie. Following research on infant walking, we
systematically designed reinforcement learning training regimens and tested the
resulting controllers in simulated environments analogous to those used for
babies--but without the practical constraints. Results reveal new insights into
the behavioral impact of different training regimens and the development of
Cassie's learned behaviors relative to infants who are learning to walk. This
interdisciplinary baby-robot approach provides inspiration for future research
designed to systematically test effects of training on the development of
complex learned robot behaviors.

Motivation: RIT任务（如用扳手拧螺母）需要毫米级精度和长期稳定性，但螺母旋转和摩擦等因素增加了复杂性。

Method: 提出sim-to-real框架，包括基于强化学习的插入策略和失败预测模块；通过将扳手姿态表示为螺母坐标系而非机器人坐标系，提升仿真到现实的迁移能力。

Result: 在仿真和现实环境中，该方法不仅单次成功率高，还能在长期重复任务中保持稳定性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了RIT任务的挑战，实现了高精度和长期稳定性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of Rhythmic Insertion Tasks (RIT), where
a robot must repeatedly perform high-precision insertions, such as screwing a
nut into a bolt with a wrench. The inherent difficulty of RIT lies in achieving
millimeter-level accuracy and maintaining consistent performance over multiple
repetitions, particularly when factors like nut rotation and friction introduce
additional complexity. We propose a sim-to-real framework that integrates a
reinforcement learning-based insertion policy with a failure forecasting
module. By representing the wrench's pose in the nut's coordinate frame rather
than the robot's frame, our approach significantly enhances sim-to-real
transferability. The insertion policy, trained in simulation, leverages
real-time 6D pose tracking to execute precise alignment, insertion, and
rotation maneuvers. Simultaneously, a neural network predicts potential
execution failures, triggering a simple recovery mechanism that lifts the
wrench and retries the insertion. Extensive experiments in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate that our method not only achieves a high
one-time success rate but also robustly maintains performance over long-horizon
repetitive tasks.

Conclusion: 通过腰部关节设计和CGCL方法，四足机器人的垂直攀爬能力得到显著提升，为复杂地形应用提供了新可能。

Abstract: In recent years, advancements in hardware have enabled quadruped robots to
operate with high power and speed, while robust locomotion control using
reinforcement learning (RL) has also been realized. As a result, expectations
are rising for the automation of tasks such as material transport and
exploration in unknown environments. However, autonomous locomotion in rough
terrains with significant height variations requires vertical movement, and
robots capable of performing such movements stably, along with their control
methods, have not yet been fully established. In this study, we developed the
quadruped robot KLEIYN, which features a waist joint, and aimed to expand
quadruped locomotion by enabling chimney climbing through RL. To facilitate the
learning of vertical motion, we introduced Contact-Guided Curriculum Learning
(CGCL). As a result, KLEIYN successfully climbed walls ranging from 800 mm to
1000 mm in width at an average speed of 150 mm/s, 50 times faster than
conventional robots. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the introduction of a
waist joint improves climbing performance, particularly enhancing tracking
ability on narrow walls.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as versatile tools across
various sectors, driven by their mobility and adaptability. This paper
introduces SkyVLN, a novel framework integrating vision-and-language navigation
(VLN) with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to enhance UAV autonomy in
complex urban environments. Unlike traditional navigation methods, SkyVLN
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language
instructions and visual observations, enabling UAVs to navigate through dynamic
3D spaces with improved accuracy and robustness. We present a multimodal
navigation agent equipped with a fine-grained spatial verbalizer and a history
path memory mechanism. These components allow the UAV to disambiguate spatial
contexts, handle ambiguous instructions, and backtrack when necessary. The
framework also incorporates an NMPC module for dynamic obstacle avoidance,
ensuring precise trajectory tracking and collision prevention. To validate our
approach, we developed a high-fidelity 3D urban simulation environment using
AirSim, featuring realistic imagery and dynamic urban elements. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SkyVLN significantly improves navigation success
rates and efficiency, particularly in new and unseen environments.

Abstract: Our Robust, Explainable Autonomy for Scientific Icy Moon Operations (REASIMO)
effort contributes to NASA's Concepts for Ocean worlds Life Detection
Technology (COLDTech) program, which explores science platform technologies for
ocean worlds such as Europa and Enceladus. Ocean world missions pose
significant operational challenges. These include long communication lags,
limited power, and lifetime limitations caused by radiation damage and hostile
conditions. Given these operational limitations, onboard autonomy will be vital
for future Ocean world missions. Besides the management of nominal lander
operations, onboard autonomy must react appropriately in the event of
anomalies. Traditional spacecraft rely on a transition into 'safe-mode' in
which non-essential components and subsystems are powered off to preserve
safety and maintain communication with Earth. For a severely time-limited Ocean
world mission, resolutions to these anomalies that can be executed without
Earth-in-the-loop communication and associated delays are paramount for
completion of the mission objectives and science goals. To address these
challenges, the REASIMO effort aims to demonstrate a robust level of
AI-assisted autonomy for such missions, including the ability to detect and
recover from anomalies, and to perform missions based on pre-trained behaviors
rather than hard-coded, predetermined logic like all prior space missions. We
developed an AI-assisted, personality-driven, intelligent framework for control
of an Ocean world mission by combining a mix of advanced technologies. To
demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we perform tests of autonomous
sampling operations on a lander-manipulator testbed at the NASA Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, approximating possible surface conditions such a mission might
encounter.

TL;DR: Episodic RRT (ERRT) 是一种结合深度强化学习的混合规划框架，通过多步探索替代随机采样，显著提升了运动规划的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于采样的运动规划器（如RRT）在高维或复杂环境中效率低下，主要依赖随机采样导致探索不集中。

Method: ERRT 使用深度强化学习（DRL）生成多步探索片段，取代随机点采样，实现有向的路径搜索。

Result: 在2D、3D和6D环境中，ERRT及其变体表现优于传统方法，6D机械臂场景中成功率98%，速度提升107倍，碰撞检测减少99.6%。

Conclusion: ERRT通过有向探索显著提升了运动规划的效率，其渐进最优变体ERRT*在优化性能上表现更优。

Abstract: Classical sampling-based motion planners like the RRTs suffer from
inefficiencies, particularly in cluttered or high-dimensional spaces, due to
their reliance on undirected, random sampling. This paper introduces the
Episodic RRT, a novel hybrid planning framework that replaces the primitive of
a random point with a learned, multi-step "exploratory episode" generated by a
Deep Reinforcement Learning agent. By making the DRL agent the engine of
exploration, ERRT transforms the search process from a diffuse, volumetric
expansion into a directed, branch-like growth. This paradigm shift yields key
advantages: it counters the curse of dimensionality with focused exploration,
minimizes expensive collision checks by proactively proposing locally valid
paths, and improves connectivity by generating inherently connected path
segments. We demonstrate through extensive empirical evaluation across 2D, 3D,
and 6D environments that ERRT and its variants consistently and significantly
outperform their classical counterparts. In a challenging 6D robotic arm
scenario, ERRT achieves a 98% success rate compared to 19% for RRT, is up to
107x faster, reduces collision checks by over 99.6%, and finds initial paths
that are nearly 50% shorter. Furthermore, its asymptotically optimal variant,
ERRT*, demonstrates vastly superior anytime performance, refining solutions to
near-optimality up to 29x faster than standard RRT* in 3D environments. Code:

Motivation: 解决深度强化学习在连续控制任务中数据需求大、长时规划难、安全性不足的问题，同时弥补MPC的局部最优和成本函数设计复杂的缺陷。

Method: 整合贝叶斯MPC与演员-评论家强化学习，利用Q值优化控制序列，避免显式成本函数设计，通过SVGD确保安全边界。

Result: 在2D导航和机器人操作任务中，Q-STAC表现出更高的样本效率、鲁棒性和最优性。

Conclusion: Q-STAC成功结合了两种方法的优势，实现了高效、安全且最优的控制。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable success in continuous
control tasks, yet often requires extensive training data, struggles with
complex, long-horizon planning, and fails to maintain safety constraints during
operation. Meanwhile, Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers explainability and
constraint satisfaction, but typically yields only locally optimal solutions
and demands careful cost function design. This paper introduces the Q-guided
STein variational model predictive Actor-Critic (Q-STAC), a novel framework
that bridges these approaches by integrating Bayesian MPC with actor-critic
reinforcement learning through constrained Stein Variational Gradient Descent
(SVGD). Our method optimizes control sequences directly using learned Q-values
as objectives, eliminating the need for explicit cost function design while
leveraging known system dynamics to enhance sample efficiency and ensure
control signals remain within safe boundaries. Extensive experiments on 2D
navigation and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that Q-STAC achieves
superior sample efficiency, robustness, and optimality compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, while maintaining the high expressiveness of
policy distributions. Experiment videos are available on our website:

Abstract: Multi-task multi-agent reinforcement learning (MT-MARL) has recently gained
attention for its potential to enhance MARL's adaptability across multiple
tasks. However, it is challenging for existing multi-task learning methods to
handle complex problems, as they are unable to handle unrelated tasks and
possess limited knowledge transfer capabilities. In this paper, we propose a
hierarchical approach that efficiently addresses these challenges. The
high-level module utilizes a skill graph, while the low-level module employs a
standard MARL algorithm. Our approach offers two contributions. First, we
consider the MT-MARL problem in the context of unrelated tasks, expanding the
scope of MTRL. Second, the skill graph is used as the upper layer of the
standard hierarchical approach, with training independent of the lower layer,
effectively handling unrelated tasks and enhancing knowledge transfer
capabilities. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate these advantages
and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the latest hierarchical
MAPPO algorithms. Videos and code are available at

Result: ρ能有效捕捉个体差异，机器人行为的可预测性和一致性以及积极情感状态显著提升安全感知。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要结合心理和行为维度的自适应安全模型，以提升人机交互的信任和效果。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in human-robot interaction (HRI) is essential to foster user
trust and enable the broader adoption of robotic systems. Traditional safety
models primarily rely on sensor-based measures, such as relative distance and
velocity, to assess physical safety. However, these models often fail to
capture subjective safety perceptions, which are shaped by individual traits
and contextual factors. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a parameterized
general safety model that bridges the gap between physical and perceived safety
by incorporating a personalization parameter, $\rho$, into the safety
measurement framework to account for individual differences in safety
perception. Through a series of hypothesis-driven human-subject studies in a
simulated rescue scenario, we investigate how emotional state, trust, and robot
behavior influence perceived safety. Our results show that $\rho$ effectively
captures meaningful individual differences, driven by affective responses,
trust in task consistency, and clustering into distinct user types.
Specifically, our findings confirm that predictable and consistent robot
behavior as well as the elicitation of positive emotional states, significantly
enhance perceived safety. Moreover, responses cluster into a small number of
user types, supporting adaptive personalization based on shared safety models.
Notably, participant role significantly shapes safety perception, and repeated
exposure reduces perceived safety for participants in the casualty role,
emphasizing the impact of physical interaction and experiential change. These
findings highlight the importance of adaptive, human-centered safety models
that integrate both psychological and behavioral dimensions, offering a pathway
toward more trustworthy and effective HRI in safety-critical domains.

*Zhenyang Liu,Yikai Wang,Kuanning Wang,Longfei Liang,Xiangyang Xue,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为4D Diffusion Policy (DP4)的新方法，通过引入时空感知改进视觉模仿学习，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模仿学习方法依赖历史轨迹的行为克隆，缺乏3D空间和4D时空感知能力，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: DP4利用动态高斯世界模型从交互环境中学习3D空间和4D时空感知，通过单视角RGB-D观测构建当前3D场景并预测未来场景，优化轨迹生成。

Result: 在17个仿真任务和3个真实机器人任务中，DP4表现优于基线方法，仿真任务成功率提升16.4%、14%和6.45%，真实任务提升8.6%。

Conclusion: DP4通过时空感知显著提升了视觉模仿学习的性能，适用于复杂任务的实际部署。

Abstract: Visual imitation learning is effective for robots to learn versatile tasks.
However, many existing methods rely on behavior cloning with supervised
historical trajectories, limiting their 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal
awareness. Consequently, these methods struggle to capture the 3D structures
and 4D spatiotemporal relationships necessary for real-world deployment. In
this work, we propose 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4), a novel visual imitation
learning method that incorporates spatiotemporal awareness into diffusion-based
policies. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on trajectory cloning, DP4
leverages a dynamic Gaussian world model to guide the learning of 3D spatial
and 4D spatiotemporal perceptions from interactive environments. Our method
constructs the current 3D scene from a single-view RGB-D observation and
predicts the future 3D scene, optimizing trajectory generation by explicitly
modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments across
17 simulation tasks with 173 variants and 3 real-world robotic tasks
demonstrate that the 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4) outperforms baseline methods,
improving the average simulation task success rate by 16.4% (Adroit), 14%
(DexArt), and 6.45% (RLBench), and the average real-world robotic task success
rate by 8.6%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放世界环境中机器人系统在长时程任务中整合物体检测和高级任务规划的挑战。

Result: 实验证明LOVON能成功完成涉及实时检测、搜索和导航的长序列任务，并在不同机器人上展示兼容性。

Conclusion: LOVON在动态环境中实现了高效的物体导航，具有广泛的适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Object navigation in open-world environments remains a formidable and
pervasive challenge for robotic systems, particularly when it comes to
executing long-horizon tasks that require both open-world object detection and
high-level task planning. Traditional methods often struggle to integrate these
components effectively, and this limits their capability to deal with complex,
long-range navigation missions. In this paper, we propose LOVON, a novel
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for hierarchical task
planning with open-vocabulary visual detection models, tailored for effective
long-range object navigation in dynamic, unstructured environments. To tackle
real-world challenges including visual jittering, blind zones, and temporary
target loss, we design dedicated solutions such as Laplacian Variance Filtering
for visual stabilization. We also develop a functional execution logic for the
robot that guarantees LOVON's capabilities in autonomous navigation, task
adaptation, and robust task completion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the
successful completion of long-sequence tasks involving real-time detection,
search, and navigation toward open-vocabulary dynamic targets. Furthermore,
real-world experiments across different legged robots (Unitree Go2, B2, and
H1-2) showcase the compatibility and appealing plug-and-play feature of LOVON.

Conclusion: 该框架提高了多机器人系统的可扩展性、可靠性和容错性，适用于现实世界中的大规模部署。

Abstract: In multi-robot systems (MRS), cooperative localization is a crucial task for
enhancing system robustness and scalability, especially in GPS-denied or
communication-limited environments. However, adversarial attacks, such as
sensor manipulation, and communication jamming, pose significant challenges to
the performance of traditional localization methods. In this paper, we propose
a novel distributed fault-tolerant cooperative localization framework to
enhance resilience against sensor and communication disruptions in adversarial
environments. We introduce an adaptive event-triggered communication strategy
that dynamically adjusts communication thresholds based on real-time sensing
and communication quality. This strategy ensures optimal performance even in
the presence of sensor degradation or communication failure. Furthermore, we
conduct a rigorous analysis of the convergence and stability properties of the
proposed algorithm, demonstrating its resilience against bounded adversarial
zones and maintaining accurate state estimation. Robotarium-based experiment
results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms traditional
methods in terms of localization accuracy and communication efficiency,
particularly in adversarial settings. Our approach offers improved scalability,
reliability, and fault tolerance for MRS, making it suitable for large-scale
deployments in real-world, challenging environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在部分观测环境中避障的挑战，尤其是处理快速移动障碍物时的局限性。

Method: 结合涡流面板法（VPM）和基于高阶控制屏障函数（HOCBF）的模型预测控制器（MPC），利用最小包围椭圆（MBE）和自适应卡尔曼滤波（AKF）处理障碍物动态。

Result: 通过仿真和真实实验验证了系统的有效性，实现了复杂环境中的实时避障。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂环境中表现出高效的避障能力，尤其适用于动态障碍物场景。

Abstract: This article presents a novel stream function-based navigational control
system for obstacle avoidance, where obstacles are represented as
two-dimensional (2D) rigid surfaces in inviscid, incompressible flows. The
approach leverages the vortex panel method (VPM) and incorporates safety
margins to control the stream function and flow properties around virtual
surfaces, enabling navigation in complex, partially observed environments using
real-time sensing. To address the limitations of the VPM in managing relative
distance and avoiding rapidly accelerating obstacles at close proximity, the
system integrates a model predictive controller (MPC) based on higher-order
control barrier functions (HOCBF). This integration incorporates VPM trajectory
generation, state estimation, and constraint handling into a receding-horizon
optimization problem. The 2D rigid surfaces are enclosed using minimum bounding
ellipses (MBEs), while an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) captures and predicts
obstacle dynamics, propagating these estimates into the MPC-HOCBF for rapid
avoidance maneuvers. Evaluation is conducted using a PX4-powered Clover drone
Gazebo simulator and real-time experiments involving a COEX Clover quadcopter
equipped with a 360 degree LiDAR sensor.

Abstract: Manipulating articulated tools, such as tweezers or scissors, has rarely been
explored in previous research. Unlike rigid tools, articulated tools change
their shape dynamically, creating unique challenges for dexterous robotic
hands. In this work, we present a hierarchical, goal-conditioned reinforcement
learning (GCRL) framework to improve the manipulation capabilities of
anthropomorphic robotic hands using articulated tools. Our framework comprises
two policy layers: (1) a low-level policy that enables the dexterous hand to
manipulate the tool into various configurations for objects of different sizes,
and (2) a high-level policy that defines the tool's goal state and controls the
robotic arm for object-picking tasks. We employ an encoder, trained on
synthetic pointclouds, to estimate the tool's affordance states--specifically,
how different tool configurations (e.g., tweezer opening angles) enable
grasping of objects of varying sizes--from input point clouds, thereby enabling
precise tool manipulation. We also utilize a privilege-informed heuristic
policy to generate replay buffer, improving the training efficiency of the
high-level policy. We validate our approach through real-world experiments,
showing that the robot can effectively manipulate a tweezer-like tool to grasp
objects of diverse shapes and sizes with a 70.8 % success rate. This study
highlights the potential of RL to advance dexterous robotic manipulation of
articulated tools.

Result: 在Unitree G1机器人上验证，ULC在跟踪性能和任务覆盖范围上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ULC证明了统一控制的可行性，且不牺牲性能，适用于复杂运动-操作任务。

Abstract: Loco-Manipulation for humanoid robots aims to enable robots to integrate
mobility with upper-body tracking capabilities. Most existing approaches adopt
hierarchical architectures that decompose control into isolated upper-body
(manipulation) and lower-body (locomotion) policies. While this decomposition
reduces training complexity, it inherently limits coordination between
subsystems and contradicts the unified whole-body control exhibited by humans.
We demonstrate that a single unified policy can achieve a combination of
tracking accuracy, large workspace, and robustness for humanoid
loco-manipulation. We propose the Unified Loco-Manipulation Controller (ULC), a
single-policy framework that simultaneously tracks root velocity, root height,
torso rotation, and dual-arm joint positions in an end-to-end manner, proving
the feasibility of unified control without sacrificing performance. We achieve
this unified control through key technologies: sequence skill acquisition for
progressive learning complexity, residual action modeling for fine-grained
control adjustments, command polynomial interpolation for smooth motion
transitions, random delay release for robustness to deploy variations, load
randomization for generalization to external disturbances, and
center-of-gravity tracking for providing explicit policy gradients to maintain
stability. We validate our method on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot with 3-DOF
(degrees-of-freedom) waist. Compared with strong baselines, ULC shows better
tracking performance to disentangled methods and demonstrating larger workspace
coverage. The unified dual-arm tracking enables precise manipulation under
external loads while maintaining coordinated whole-body control for complex
loco-manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“bounom=odes”的算法，结合均匀覆盖和异常区域探索，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀覆盖算法在异常集群场景中效率不足，需优先探索异常区域。

Method: 交替使用均匀采样和基于深度强化学习的异常集群探索。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于多个基线算法。

Conclusion: 结合均匀覆盖与针对性探索能有效提升路径规划性能。

Abstract: A common class of algorithms for informative path planning (IPP) follows
boustrophedon ("as the ox turns") patterns, which aim to achieve uniform area
coverage. However, IPP is often applied in scenarios where anomalies, such as
plant diseases, pollution, or hurricane damage, appear in clusters. In such
cases, prioritizing the exploration of anomalous regions over uniform coverage
is beneficial. This work introduces a class of algorithms referred to as
bounom\=odes ("as the ox grazes"), which alternates between uniform
boustrophedon sampling and targeted exploration of detected anomaly clusters.
While uniform sampling can be designed using geometric principles, close
exploration of clusters depends on the spatial distribution of anomalies and
must be learned. In our implementation, the close exploration behavior is
learned using deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several established
baselines.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a fuzzy system for conducting short-term
transactions in the forex market. The system is designed to enhance common
strategies in the forex market using fuzzy logic, thereby improving the
accuracy of transactions. Traditionally, technical strategies based on
oscillator indicators have relied on predefined ranges for indicators such as
Relative Strength Index (RSI), Commodity Channel Indicator (CCI), and
Stochastic to determine entry points for trades. However, the use of these
classic indicators has yielded suboptimal results due to the changing nature of
the market over time. In our proposed approach, instead of employing classical
indicators, we introduce a fuzzy Mamdani system for each indicator. The results
obtained from these systems are then combined through voting to design a
trading robot. Our findings demonstrate a considerable increase in the
profitability factor compared to three other methods. Additionally, net profit,
gross profit, and maximum capital reduction are calculated and compared across
all approaches.

Abstract: This paper leverages linear systems theory to propose a principled measure of
complexity for network systems. We focus on a network of first-order scalar
linear systems interconnected through a directed graph. By locally filtering
out the effect of nodal dynamics in the interconnected system, we propose a new
quantitative index of network complexity rooted in the notion of McMillan
degree of a linear system. First, we show that network systems with the same
interconnection structure share the same complexity index for almost all
choices of their interconnection weights. Then, we investigate the dependence
of the proposed index on the topology of the network and the pattern of
heterogeneity of the nodal dynamics. Specifically, we find that the index
depends on the matching number of subgraphs identified by nodal dynamics of
different nature, highlighting the joint impact of network architecture and
component diversity on overall system complexity.

Each agent estimates its position using 6G network-based triangulation, and the
scheduling of information updates is governed by Age of Information (AoI) and
Value of Information (VoI) metrics. We design three lightweight, signaling-free

accurate formations with no additional communication overhead, showing that
worst-case formation adherence increases by 20%.

harnessing data center's load regulation capabilities. By taking local voltage
measurements and adjusting power injections at each data center buses through
the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) scheme, we are able to
maintain safe voltage magnitude in a distributed fashion with higher data
center computing load. Simulations using real large language model (LLM)
inference load validate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism. Both the
LLM power data and proposed control scheme are open sourced.

*Xinyu Huang,Yixiao Zhang,Yingying Pei,Jianzhe Xue,Xuemin Shen*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种数字代理（DA）辅助的资源管理方案，用于提升集成感知与通信（ISAC）网络中的用户体验质量（QoE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户QoE是一个综合指标，结合了服务质量（QoS）、用户行为动态和环境复杂性，但现有方法难以全面优化。

Method: DA模块包括用户状态预测、QoS因子选择及QoE拟合模型，通过聚类用户并利用CRB模型量化资源分配对感知精度的影响，采用双层数据-模型驱动算法进行资源优化。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方案在用户QoE方面优于基准方案。

Conclusion: DA辅助的资源管理方案能有效提升ISAC网络中的用户QoE。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a digital agent (DA)-assisted resource management
scheme for enhanced user quality of experience (QoE) in integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) networks. Particularly, user QoE is a comprehensive metric
that integrates quality of service (QoS), user behavioral dynamics, and
environmental complexity. The novel DA module includes a user status prediction
model, a QoS factor selection model, and a QoE fitting model, which analyzes
historical user status data to construct and update user-specific QoE models.
Users are clustered into different groups based on their QoE models. A
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) model is utilized to quantify the impact of allocated
communication resources on sensing accuracy. A joint optimization problem of
communication and computing resource management is formulated to maximize
long-term user QoE while satisfying CRB and resource constraints. A two-layer
data-model-driven algorithm is developed to solve the formulated problem, where
the top layer utilizes an advanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm to
make group-level decisions, and the bottom layer uses convex optimization
techniques to make user-level decisions. Simulation results based on a
real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed DA-assisted resource
management scheme outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of user QoE.

TL;DR: VisioPath结合视觉语言模型和模型预测控制，实现动态交通环境中的安全自动驾驶。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态交通环境中自动驾驶的安全轨迹规划问题。

Method: 利用鸟瞰视频处理和零样本VLM能力获取车辆信息，构建椭圆避碰势场，结合最优控制进行轨迹规划。

Result: 在SUMO模拟中表现优于传统MPC方法。

Conclusion: VisioPath为复杂交通系统的安全轨迹规划提供了重要进展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce VisioPath, a novel framework combining
vision-language models (VLMs) with model predictive control (MPC) to enable
safe autonomous driving in dynamic traffic environments. The proposed approach
leverages a bird's-eye view video processing pipeline and zero-shot VLM
capabilities to obtain structured information about surrounding vehicles,
including their positions, dimensions, and velocities. Using this rich
perception output, we construct elliptical collision-avoidance potential fields
around other traffic participants, which are seamlessly integrated into a
finite-horizon optimal control problem for trajectory planning. The resulting
trajectory optimization is solved via differential dynamic programming with an
adaptive regularization scheme and is embedded in an event-triggered MPC loop.
To ensure collision-free motion, a safety verification layer is incorporated in
the framework that provides an assessment of potential unsafe trajectories.
Extensive simulations in Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) demonstrate that
VisioPath outperforms conventional MPC baselines across multiple metrics. By
combining modern AI-driven perception with the rigorous foundation of optimal
control, VisioPath represents a significant step forward in safe trajectory
planning for complex traffic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自适应控制中回归器激励（PE）行为不佳的问题，避免激励凭空产生的不合理现象。

Method: 引入正则回归器的概念，提出PE分解，将激励限制在特定子空间内。

Result: 通过几何表征回归器激励，为自适应控制开辟了新途径。

Conclusion: 正则回归器和PE分解为自适应控制提供了新的理论基础和应用方向。

Abstract: This paper addresses a shortcoming in adaptive control, that the property of
a regressor being persistently exciting (PE) is not well-behaved. One can
construct regressors that upend the commonsense notion that excitation should
not be created out of nothing. To amend the situation, a notion of regularity
of regressors is needed. We are naturally led to a broad class of regular
regressors that enjoy the property that their excitation is always confined to
a subspace, a foundational result called the PE decomposition. A geometric
characterization of regressor excitation opens up new avenues for adaptive
control, as we demonstrate by formulating a number of new adaptive control
problems.

Conclusion: D-STAB为网络物理系统的安全研究提供了新的攻击范式，揭示了模型保真度差距带来的潜在威胁。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel cyber-physical attack paradigm, termed the Dual
State-Space Fidelity Blade (D-STAB), which targets the firmware of core
cyber-physical components as a new class of attack surfaces. The D-STAB attack
exploits the information asymmetry caused by the fidelity gap between
high-fidelity and low-fidelity physical models in cyber-physical systems. By
designing precise adversarial constraints based on high-fidelity state-space
information, the attack induces deviations in high-fidelity states that remain
undetected by defenders relying on low-fidelity observations. The effectiveness
of D-STAB is demonstrated through a case study in cyber-physical battery
systems, specifically in an optimal charging task governed by a Battery
Management System (BMS).

Motivation: 研究净计量政策变化对商业消费者的影响，尤其是对太阳能和储能结合使用的激励效果。

Method: 分析不同净计量政策下商业消费者的能源使用情况，重点关注太阳能和储能结合的效果。

Result: 最新净计量政策对仅使用太阳能的消费者不利，但对搭配储能的消费者更有利；灵活需求的出口价格价值有限。

Conclusion: 政策变化更倾向于支持储能与太阳能结合使用，而非单独的太阳能发电。

Abstract: Net energy metering has been a successful policy for increasing solar
generation installations and reducing the costs of photovoltaic arrays for
consumers. However, increased maturity of solar technologies and concerns over
cost shifts created by net energy metering have recently caused the policy to
change its incentives. What once favored behind-the-meter solar generation now
is focused on compensating flexible operation. This paper explores the impacts
that different net energy metering policies have on commercial consumers with
various distributed energy resources. We show that the newest iteration of net
energy metering is less beneficial for consumers with only solar generation and
instead favors those that pair energy storage with solar. Though shiftable
flexible demand offers consumers the ability to operate flexibly, the export
prices offered by the latest net energy metering policy provide limited value
to flexible demand.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称系统在多种应用中常见，但相位条件对其反馈稳定性的必要性尚未明确。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 通过分析复对称半扇形矩阵的广义扇形分解，证明变换矩阵可为实数。

Result: 小相位条件对对称系统是充分且必要的，同时探讨了非对称系统的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究为对称系统的反馈稳定性提供了完整的相位条件理论，并揭示了非对称系统的主要挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that the small phase condition is both sufficient and
necessary to ensure the feedback stability when the interconnected systems are
symmetric. Such symmetric systems arise in diverse applications. The key lies
in that, for a complex symmetric and semi-sectorial matrix, the transformation
matrix in its generalized sectorial decomposition can be taken to be real. Such
a result fills the gap of phase based necessary condition for the feedback
stability of symmetric systems, and serves as a counterpart of the necessity
result for small gain condition. Moreover, we explore the necessity of small
phase condition for general asymmetric systems. Some insightful results are
presented, which help to clarify the main challenge in the general case.

Result: 在含高比例可再生能源的4总线系统中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来可再生能源为主的电网提供了可扩展且高效的频率调节解决方案。

Abstract: In the context of dynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs), the integration of
frequency containment reserve (FCR) and fast frequency control (FFC) enabled
via local compensation of power imbalance represents a significant advancement
in decentralized frequency regulation. However, they still have to cope with
the limited power and energy capacities associated with commonly available
storage solutions. This work combines a disturbance estimation based
decentralized local control with distributed imbalance compensation in the
event of local shortfall. The layered architecture facilitates fast local
corrections in power setpoints while enabling coordination between neighbouring
DVPP nodes to leverage the aggregated capacity, ensuring scalable and efficient
operation suitable for renewable-heavy future grids. The proposed approach is
validated on an illustrative 4-bus system with a high percentage of renewables.

Abstract: In the context of growing concerns about power disruptions, grid reliability
and the need for decarbonization, this study evaluates a broad range of clean
backup power systems (BPSs) to replace traditional emergency diesel generators.
A scenario-based stochastic optimization framework using actual load profiles
and outage probabilities is proposed to assess the most promising options from
a pool of 27 technologies. This framework allows a comparison of
cost-effectiveness and environmental impact of individual technologies and
hybrid BPSs across various scenarios. The results highlight the trade-off
between total annual system cost and emissions. Significant emission reductions
can be achieved at moderate cost increases but deep decarbonization levels
incur higher costs. Primary and secondary batteries are included in optimal
clean fuel-based systems across all decarbonization levels, combining
cost-effective power delivery and long-term storage benefits. The findings
highlight the often-overlooked importance of fuel replacement on both emissions
and costs. Among the assessed technologies, ammonia generators and hydrogen
fuel cells combined with secondary iron-air batteries emerge as cost-effective
solutions for achieving decarbonization goals. To ensure a broad range of
applicability, the study outlines the impact of emergency fuel purchases,
varying demand patterns and demand response options on the optimal BPS. The
research findings are valuable for optimizing the design of clean BPSs to
economically meet the needs of many facility types and decarbonization targets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单传感器的分数阶记忆增强攻击诊断方案（FO-MADS），用于智能微电网的低延迟故障定位和网络攻击检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能微电网面临网络攻击威胁，现有诊断方法依赖昂贵设备或严格假设，不适用于单传感器场景。

Method: 采用Caputo和Grünwald-Letnikov导数构建双分数阶特征库，结合两阶段分层分类器和渐进记忆重放对抗训练（PMR-AT）。

Result: 在四种攻击场景下，诊断准确率分别为96.6%（偏置）、94.0%（噪声）、92.8%（数据替换）和95.7%（重放），无攻击时达96.7%。

Conclusion: FO-MADS是一种成本低、易部署的方案，显著提升了智能微电网的网络安全韧性。

Abstract: Cyber-attacks jeopardize the safe operation of smart microgrids. At the same
time, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point
instrumentation or stringent modelling assumptions that are untenable under
single-sensor constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order
Memory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves low-latency
fault localisation and cyber-attack detection using only one VPQ
(Voltage-Power-Reactive-power) sensor. FO-MADS first constructs a dual
fractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and
Gr\"unwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and
slow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then
pinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch,
effectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened
through Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose
attack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining
(OHEM) to prioritise the most challenging samples. Experiments on a
four-inverter microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under
four attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6 % (bias), 94.0
% (noise), 92.8 % (data replacement), and 95.7 % (replay), while sustaining
96.7 % under attack-free conditions. These results establish FO-MADS as a
cost-effective and readily deployable solution that markedly enhances the
cyber-physical resilience of smart microgrids.

Result: 仿真测试表明，该方法在各种控制器和干扰（包括死区时间不确定性）下均能提升控制性能。

Conclusion: 提出的死区时间补偿方法有效改善了路径跟踪控制的性能，适用于实际系统。

Abstract: In the realm of autonomous vehicle technologies and advanced driver
assistance systems, precise and reliable path tracking controllers are vital
for safe and efficient navigation. However the presence of dead time in the
vehicle control systems poses a challenge to real-world systems. Input and
output delays are caused by factors like sensor processing and mechanical
response and can range up to a few hundred milliseconds. This chapter addresses
the problem of dead time in path tracking control and proposes a method to
compensate the dead time. The proposed solution involves a nonlinear prediction
model, in a structure similar to the Smith predictor, but incorporating the
kinematic behavior of the vehicle plant system. The implementation avoids
numeric integration or optimization, enabling a fast execution. Simulation
tests with various controllers and disturbances, including dead-time
uncertainty, demonstrate the efficacy of the dead-time compensation method.
Results indicate improved control performance in all tested scenarios.

Motivation: 机器学习算法的成功与特征提取密切相关，而数据表示的质量和从未见过的数据集中有效提取特征的能力是关键挑战。

Method: 提出多表示法，整合同一模态的多种表示（如Siamese Network、自监督模型和放射组学特征）。

Result: 多表示法在性能指标上优于单一表示法，并在X射线图像数据上展示了其可迁移性和资源效率。

Conclusion: 多表示法不仅适用于医学数据，还具有广泛的潜在应用领域，展示了其多功能性和实用性。

Abstract: The success of machine learning algorithms is inherently related to the
extraction of meaningful features, as they play a pivotal role in the
performance of these algorithms. Central to this challenge is the quality of
data representation. However, the ability to generalize and extract these
features effectively from unseen datasets is also crucial. In light of this, we
introduce a novel concept: the polyrepresentation. Polyrepresentation
integrates multiple representations of the same modality extracted from
distinct sources, for example, vector embeddings from the Siamese Network,
self-supervised models, and interpretable radiomic features. This approach
yields better performance metrics compared to relying on a single
representation. Additionally, in the context of X-ray images, we demonstrate
the transferability of the created polyrepresentation to a smaller dataset,
underscoring its potential as a pragmatic and resource-efficient approach in
various image-related solutions. It is worth noting that the concept of
polyprepresentation on the example of medical data can also be applied to other
domains, showcasing its versatility and broad potential impact.

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has significantly advanced medical
image segmentation. However, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical
image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In
this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a
two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically
designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba state-space
model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through sparse,
adaptive expert routing. The first stage employs a Soft Mixture-of-Experts
(SMoE) layer to partition input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to
specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second
stage aggregates these outputs via a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group
information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design,
combining local expert routing with global expert refinement improves
generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art
results across datasets from the three most commonly used 3D medical imaging
modalities and data quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CCELLA仅支持AxT2序列、未研究域转移及未关注病理结果的局限性，提升临床实用性。

Method: 扩展CCELLA以生成bpMRI（包括AxT2、HighB和ADC），研究域适应策略，通过合成数据预训练分类器。

Result: CCELLA++在HighB和ADC序列上FID提升，分类器性能优于真实数据，尤其在外部数据量少时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 合成bpMRI能提升分类器性能，未来需优化图像质量、多序列训练及信息条件化。

Abstract: Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) could mitigate data scarcity
challenges affecting machine learning development for medical image
interpretation. The recent CCELLA LDM improved prostate cancer detection
performance using synthetic MRI for classifier training but was limited to the
axial T2-weighted (AxT2) sequence, did not investigate inter-institutional
domain shift, and prioritized radiology over histopathology outcomes. We
propose CCELLA++ to address these limitations and improve clinical utility.
Methods: CCELLA++ expands CCELLA for simultaneous biparametric prostate MRI
(bpMRI) generation, including the AxT2, high b-value diffusion series (HighB)
and apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). Domain adaptation was
investigated by pretraining classifiers on real or LDM-generated synthetic data
from an internal institution, followed with fine-tuning on progressively
smaller fractions of an out-of-distribution, external dataset. Results:
CCELLA++ improved 3D FID for HighB and ADC but not AxT2 (0.013, 0.012, 0.063
respectively) sequences compared to CCELLA (0.060). Classifier pretraining with
CCELLA++ bpMRI outperformed real bpMRI in AP and AUC for all domain adaptation
scenarios. CCELLA++ pretraining achieved highest classifier performance below
50% (n=665) external dataset volume. Conclusion: Synthetic bpMRI generated by
our method can improve downstream classifier generalization and performance
beyond real bpMRI or CCELLA-generated AxT2-only images. Future work should seek
to quantify medical image sample quality, balance multi-sequence LDM training,
and condition the LDM with additional information. Significance: The proposed
CCELLA++ LDM can generate synthetic bpMRI that outperforms real data for domain
adaptation with a limited target institution dataset. Our code is available at

Abstract: Breast density assessment is a crucial component of mammographic
interpretation, with high breast density (BI-RADS categories C and D)
representing both a significant risk factor for developing breast cancer and a
technical challenge for tumor detection. This study proposes an automated deep
learning system for robust binary classification of breast density (low: A/B
vs. high: C/D) using the VinDr-Mammo dataset. We implemented and compared four
advanced convolutional neural networks: ResNet18, ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0,
and DenseNet121, each enhanced with channel attention mechanisms. To address
the inherent class imbalance, we developed a novel Combined Focal Label
Smoothing Loss function that integrates focal loss, label smoothing, and
class-balanced weighting. Our preprocessing pipeline incorporated advanced
techniques, including contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)
and comprehensive data augmentation. The individual models were combined
through an optimized ensemble voting approach, achieving superior performance
(AUC: 0.963, F1-score: 0.952) compared to any single model. This system
demonstrates significant potential to standardize density assessments in
clinical practice, potentially improving screening efficiency and early cancer
detection rates while reducing inter-observer variability among radiologists.

the potential of the newly introduced Capsule-ConvKAN in capturing spatial
patterns, managing complex features, and addressing the limitations of
traditional convolutional models in medical image classification.

### [183] [COS2A: Conversion from Sentinel-2 to AVIRIS Hyperspectral Data Using Interpretable Algorithm With Spectral-Spatial Duality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06575)
*Chia-Hsiang Lin,Jui-Ting Chen,Zi-Chao Leng,Jhao-Ting Lin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新算法（COS2A），将Sentinel-2的多分辨率12波段图像转换为高分辨率AVIRIS级高光谱图像（172波段），解决了现有方法在多分辨率问题和波段范围上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentinel-2卫星的12波段图像在多分辨率和波段数量上限制了物质识别的效果，现有超分辨率方法未能解决多分辨率问题且仅适用于有限波段范围。

Method: 通过结合深度展开正则化和Q-二次范数正则化的凸/深度（CODE）小数据学习准则，提出了一种可解释的COS2A算法。

Result: 实验验证表明，COS2A算法在多种土地覆盖类型上表现出优异的超分辨率效果。

Conclusion: 该研究首次解决了Sentinel-2数据到AVIRIS级高光谱图像的转换问题，为历史数据的利用提供了新途径。

Abstract: The Sentinel-2 satellite, launched by the European Space Agency (ESA), offers
extensive spatial coverage and has become indispensable in a wide range of
remote sensing applications. However, it just has 12 spectral bands, making
substances/objects identification less effective, not mentioning the varying
spatial resolutions (10/20/60 m) across the 12 bands. If such a
multi-resolution 12-band image can be computationally converted into a
hyperspectral image with uniformly high resolution (i.e., 10 m), it
significantly facilitates remote identification tasks. Though there are some
spectral super-resolution methods, they did not address the multi-resolution
issue on one hand, and, more seriously, they mostly focused on the CAVE-level
hyperspectral image reconstruction (involving only 31 visible bands) on the
other hand, greatly limiting their applicability in real-world remote sensing
scenarios. We ambitiously aim to convert Sentinel-2 data directly into NASA's
AVIRIS-level hyperspectral image (encompassing up to 172 visible and
near-infrared (NIR) bands, after ignoring those absorption/corruption ones).
For the first time, this paper solves this specific super-resolution problem
(highly ill-posed), allowing all historical Sentinel-2 data to have their
corresponding high-standard AVIRIS counterparts. We achieve so by customizing a
novel algorithm that introduces deep unfolding regularization and
Q-quadratic-norm regularization into the so-called convex/deep (CODE)
small-data learning criterion. Based on the derived spectral-spatial duality,
the proposed interpretable COS2A algorithm demonstrates superior spectral
super-resolution results across diverse land cover types, as validated through
extensive experiments.

*Qibiao Wu,Yagang Wang,Qian Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TfeNet的新型管状特征提取网络，用于解决传统卷积神经网络在气道分割中难以捕捉细微气道结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气道区域的手动标注耗时且依赖专业知识，自动气道分割是快速支气管镜导航和临床部署机器人系统的关键。

Method: TfeNet引入方向感知卷积操作，通过空间旋转变换调整卷积核采样位置，并结合管状特征融合模块（TFFM）增强对细微气道结构的关注。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，TfeNet在气道分割任务中表现优于现有方法，尤其在ATM22数据集上达到94.95%的最高分。

Conclusion: TfeNet通过创新的卷积操作和特征融合策略，显著提升了气道分割的准确性和连续性。

Abstract: Manual annotation of airway regions in computed tomography images is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task. Automatic airway segmentation is
therefore a prerequisite for enabling rapid bronchoscopic navigation and the
clinical deployment of bronchoscopic robotic systems. Although convolutional
neural network methods have gained considerable attention in airway
segmentation, the unique tree-like structure of airways poses challenges for
conventional and deformable convolutions, which often fail to focus on fine
airway structures, leading to missed segments and discontinuities. To address
this issue, this study proposes a novel tubular feature extraction network,
named TfeNet. TfeNet introduces a novel direction-aware convolution operation
that first applies spatial rotation transformations to adjust the sampling
positions of linear convolution kernels. The deformed kernels are then
represented as line segments or polylines in 3D space. Furthermore, a tubular
feature fusion module (TFFM) is designed based on asymmetric convolution and
residual connection strategies, enhancing the network's focus on subtle airway
structures. Extensive experiments conducted on one public dataset and two
datasets used in airway segmentation challenges demonstrate that the proposed
TfeNet achieves more accuracy and continuous airway structure predictions
compared with existing methods. In particular, TfeNet achieves the highest
overall score of 94.95% on the current largest airway segmentation dataset,
Airway Tree Modeling(ATM22), and demonstrates advanced performance on the lung
fibrosis dataset(AIIB23). The code is available at

Abstract: Recent state-of-the-art algorithms in photometric stereo rely on neural
networks and operate either through prior learning or inverse rendering
optimization. Here, we revisit the problem of calibrated photometric stereo by
leveraging recent advances in 3D inverse rendering using the Gaussian Splatting
formalism. This allows us to parameterize the 3D scene to be reconstructed and
optimize it in a more interpretable manner. Our approach incorporates a
simplified model for light representation and demonstrates the potential of the
Gaussian Splatting rendering engine for the photometric stereo problem.

Conclusion: SSCV-G和MUPPO的结合为无人机视频流提供了一种高效、自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video streaming is essential for
time-sensitive applications, including remote surveillance, emergency response,
and environmental monitoring. However, it faces challenges such as limited
bandwidth, latency fluctuations, and high packet loss. To address these issues,
we propose a novel semantic self-correcting video transmission framework with
ultra-fine bitrate granularity (SSCV-G). In SSCV-G, video frames are encoded
into a compact semantic codebook space, and the transmitter adaptively sends a
subset of semantic indices based on bandwidth availability, enabling
fine-grained bitrate control for improved bandwidth efficiency. At the
receiver, a spatio-temporal vision transformer (ST-ViT) performs multi-frame
joint decoding to reconstruct dropped semantic indices by modeling intra- and
inter-frame dependencies. To further improve performance under dynamic network
conditions, we integrate a multi-user proximal policy optimization (MUPPO)
reinforcement learning scheme that jointly optimizes communication resource
allocation and semantic bitrate selection to maximize user Quality of
Experience (QoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SSCV-G
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video codecs in coding efficiency,
bandwidth adaptability, and packet loss robustness. Moreover, the proposed
MUPPO-based QoE optimization consistently surpasses existing benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像中的斑点噪声具有组织依赖性，传统方法无法直接处理，需要一种新的自监督方法。

Result: Speckle2Self在模拟和真实超声图像上表现优于传统滤波器和最先进的学习方法。

Conclusion: Speckle2Self为超声斑点噪声去除提供了一种有效的自监督解决方案，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, particularly in
medical ultrasound (US) imaging, where speckle noise significantly degrades
image quality. Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to
substantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot
be directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead,
US speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body
microstructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that
obtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by
pioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also
cannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address
this challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm
for speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is
that applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces
tissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales,
while preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective
speckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and
isolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness,
Speckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based
denoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic
simulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from
multiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and
adaptability to images from unseen domains. \textit{Code and datasets will be
released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发可靠的关键RFOs检测AI解决方案提供了重要数据和见解。

Abstract: Critical retained foreign objects (RFOs), including surgical instruments like
sponges and needles, pose serious patient safety risks and carry significant
financial and legal implications for healthcare institutions. Detecting
critical RFOs using artificial intelligence remains challenging due to their
rarity and the limited availability of chest X-ray datasets that specifically
feature critical RFOs cases. Existing datasets only contain non-critical RFOs,
like necklace or zipper, further limiting their utility for developing
clinically impactful detection algorithms. To address these limitations, we
introduce "Hopkins RFOs Bench", the first and largest dataset of its kind,
containing 144 chest X-ray images of critical RFO cases collected over 18 years
from the Johns Hopkins Health System. Using this dataset, we benchmark several
state-of-the-art object detection models, highlighting the need for enhanced
detection methodologies for critical RFO cases. Recognizing data scarcity
challenges, we further explore image synthetic methods to bridge this gap. We
evaluate two advanced synthetic image methods, DeepDRR-RFO, a physics-based
method, and RoentGen-RFO, a diffusion-based method, for creating realistic
radiographs featuring critical RFOs. Our comprehensive analysis identifies the
strengths and limitations of each synthetic method, providing insights into
effectively utilizing synthetic data to enhance model training. The Hopkins
RFOs Bench and our findings significantly advance the development of reliable,
generalizable AI-driven solutions for detecting critical RFOs in clinical chest
X-rays.

Conclusion: SimCortex提供了一种高效且拓扑保持的大脑皮层表面重建方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Accurate cortical surface reconstruction from magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) data is crucial for reliable neuroanatomical analyses. Current methods
have to contend with complex cortical geometries, strict topological
requirements, and often produce surfaces with overlaps, self-intersections, and
topological defects. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce SimCortex, a
deep learning framework that simultaneously reconstructs all brain surfaces
(left/right white-matter and pial) from T1-weighted(T1w) MRI volumes while
preserving topological properties. Our method first segments the T1w image into
a nine-class tissue label map. From these segmentations, we generate
subject-specific, collision-free initial surface meshes. These surfaces serve
as precise initializations for subsequent multiscale diffeomorphic
deformations. Employing stationary velocity fields (SVFs) integrated via
scaling-and-squaring, our approach ensures smooth, topology-preserving
transformations with significantly reduced surface collisions and
self-intersections. Evaluations on standard datasets demonstrate that SimCortex
dramatically reduces surface overlaps and self-intersections, surpassing
current methods while maintaining state-of-the-art geometric accuracy.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in the automated
detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI images. However,
achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency remains a challenge. In
this research, we propose Deep Brain Net, a novel deep learning system designed
to optimize performance in the detection of brain tumors. The model integrates
the strengths of two advanced neural network architectures which are
EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50, combined with transfer learning to improve
generalization and reduce training time. The EfficientNetB0 architecture
enhances model efficiency by utilizing mobile inverted bottleneck blocks, which
incorporate depth wise separable convolutions. This design significantly
reduces the number of parameters and computational cost while preserving the
ability of models to learn complex feature representations. The ResNet50
architecture, pre trained on large scale datasets like ImageNet, is fine tuned
for brain tumor classification. Its use of residual connections allows for
training deeper networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and
avoiding performance degradation. The integration of these components ensures
that the proposed system is both computationally efficient and highly accurate.
Extensive experiments performed on publicly available MRI datasets demonstrate
that Deep Brain Net consistently outperforms existing state of the art methods
in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and computational
efficiency. The result is an accuracy of 88 percent, a weighted F1 score of
88.75 percent, and a macro AUC ROC score of 98.17 percent which demonstrates
the robustness and clinical potential of Deep Brain Net in assisting
radiologists with brain tumor diagnosis.
