Only voltage and current data obtained from hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) tests were utilized to form the state space matrices and subsequently used for predicting the future terminal voltage at different state of charge (SoC) and aging levels. To construct the system model, 60\\% of the data from a single HPPC test was utilized to generate time-delay embedded snapshots, with embedding dimension ranging from 40 to 2000. Among these, an embedding dimension of 1810 resulted in the least residual sum of squares (RSS) error of 3.86 for the dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) model and 30 for the standard DMD model.

The cooling system consists of a fixed-capacity electric chiller and a thermal energy storage (TES) unit, jointly operated to meet stochastic hourly cooling demands under time-varying electricity prices. The life-cycle cost accounts for both capital expenditure and discounted operating cost, including electricity consumption and maintenance. A key challenge arises from the strong asymmetry in capital costs: increasing chiller capacity by one unit is far more expensive than an equivalent increase in TES capacity. As a result, identifying the right combination of chiller and TES sizes, while ensuring zero loss-of-cooling-load under optimal operation, is a non-trivial co-design problem. To address this, we formulate the chiller operation problem for a fixed infrastructure configuration as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the control action is the chiller part-load ratio (PLR). The MDP is solved using a Deep Q Network (DQN) with a constrained action space. The learned DQN RL policy minimizes electricity cost over historical traces of cooling demand and electricity prices. For each candidate chiller-TES sizing configuration, the trained policy is evaluated. We then restrict attention to configurations that fully satisfy the cooling demand and perform a life-cycle cost minimization over this feasible set to identify the cost-optimal infrastructure design.

This non-Markovian structure makes it difficult to express degradation as an additive per-time-step cost, complicating classical dynamic programming approaches. We address this challenge by formulating the fleet scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with constrained action space and designing a dense proxy reward that provides informative feedback at each time step while remaining aligned with long-term cycle-depth reduction.\n  To scale learning to large state-action spaces induced by fine-grained SoC discretization and asymmetric per-battery constraints, we develop a function-approximation reinforcement learning method using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a random nonlinear feature map combined with linear temporal-difference learning.

Given the growing prevalence of electric vehicles and their bi-directional charging capabilities--so-called vehicle-to-grid (V2G)--we study energy buffer capabilities of parked electric vehicles to alleviate pressure on grid connections. To this end, we present energy management strategies for airports providing cost-optimal apron and landside V2G charge scheduling. Specifically, we first formulate the optimal energy management problem of joint aircraft charging and landside V2G coordination as a linear program, whereby we use partial differential equations to model the aggregated charging dynamics of the electric vehicle fleet. Second, we consider a shuttle flight network with a single hub of a large Dutch airline, real-world grid prices, and synthetic parking garage occupancy data to test our framework. Our results show that V2G at even a single airport can indeed reduce energy costs to charge the aircraft fleet: Compared to a baseline scenario without V2G, the proposed concept yields cost savings of up to 32%, depending on the schedule and amount of participating vehicles, and has other potential beneficial effects on the local power grid, e.g., the reduction of potential power peaks.", "AI": {"tldr": "研究提出了一种利用机场停放的电动汽车（EV）进行车辆到电网（V2G）充电的管理策略，以降低飞机充电对机场电网的压力并节约成本。", "motivation": "随着中程电池电动飞机的部署，机场的电力需求将大幅增加。利用电动汽车的双向充电能力（V2G）来缓冲这种电力需求，以减轻电网压力。", "method": "作者将飞机充电和陆侧V2G协调的联合能源管理问题建模为一个线性规划问题。使用偏微分方程模拟电动汽车车队的聚合充电动态。在模拟环境中，考虑了一个航空公司枢纽的航班网络、实际电网价格和合成停车位占用数据来测试该框架。", "result": "研究结果表明，即使是单个机场的V2G也能显著降低飞机充电的能源成本，与没有V2G的基准情景相比，成本节约高达32%，具体取决于充电计划和参与车辆数量。此外，V2G还能带来其他有益的局部电网效应，例如减少潜在的电力峰值。", "conclusion": "V2G技术可以作为一种有效的策略，通过利用停放的电动汽车作为能量缓冲，来缓解机场电动飞机充电带来的巨大电力需求，并实现显著的成本节约和电网效益。"}}

The combination of kinematic, geometric and physics constraints underlying this domain results in challenging nonmonotone problem instances which demand breaking each manipulation action into multiple parts to achieve a desired object rearrangement.

Our key insight is that these minima can be avoided by steering a prerelocation optimization toward low-cost regions informed by Dubins path classification. These optimized prerelocations are integrated into an object traversability graph that encodes kinematic, geometric, and pushing constraints. Searching this graph in a depth-first fashion results in efficient, feasible rearrangement sequences.

We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.\n  Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.\n  To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information.

Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse.

We measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across a diverse set of in-context tasks, and uncover a dichotomy in how LLMs' representations change in context. In continual prediction settings (e.g., natural language, grid world traversal tasks) we observe that increasing context increases the straightness of neural sequence trajectories, which is correlated with improvement in model prediction. Conversely, in structured prediction settings (e.g., few-shot tasks), straightening is inconsistent -- it is only present in phases of the task with explicit structure (e.g., repeating a template), but vanishes elsewhere.

Traditional classical planners, while effective under perfect perception assumptions, are often sensitive to real-world perception constraints and rely on online search procedures that incur high computational costs.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for real-time path planning in parking scenarios. In particular, we focus on challenging scenes with tight spaces that require a high number of reversal maneuvers and adjustments. Unlike classical planners, our solution does not require ideal and structured perception, and in principle, could avoid the need for additional modules such as localization and tracking, resulting in a simpler and more practical implementation. Also, at test time, the policy generates actions through a single forward pass at each step, which is lightweight enough for real-time deployment.

Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models.

However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance.

Markers are commonly used for robot self-localization and object identification. In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions.

In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining.

By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation.

Inspired by how humans acquire skills through progressively challenging tasks, we propose MobileGen, a novel data generation framework that adaptively aligns training difficulty with the GUI agent's capability frontier. Specifically, MobileGen explicitly decouples task difficulty into structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., task goal) dimensions. It then iteratively evaluates the agent on a curated prior dataset to construct a systematic profile of its capability frontier across these two dimensions. With this profile, the probability distribution of task difficulty is adaptively computed, from which the target difficulty for the next round of training can be sampled. Guided by the sampled difficulty, a multi-agent controllable generator is finally used to synthesize high-quality interaction trajectories along with corresponding task instructions.

To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO).

In this work, we diagnose a fundamental pass-band mismatch: Standard spiking dynamics behave as a temporal low pass that emphasizes static content while attenuating motion bearing bands, where task relevant information concentrates in dynamic tasks. This phenomenon explains why SNNs can approach ANNs on static tasks yet fall behind on tasks that demand richer temporal understanding.To remedy this, we propose the Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO), a plug-and-play module that optimizes the temporal pass-band toward task-relevant motion bands. PBO introduces only two learnable parameters, and a lightweight consistency constraint that preserves semantics and boundaries, incurring negligible computational overhead and requires no architectural changes. PBO deliberately suppresses static components that contribute little to discrimination, effectively high passing the stream so that spiking activity concentrates on motion bearing content.

Existing SMPLX-based methods often suffer from slow inference, produce only coarse body poses, and exhibit misalignments or unnatural artifacts in fine-grained regions such as the face and hands. These issues make current approaches difficult to apply to downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose PEAR-a fast and robust framework for pixel-aligned expressive human mesh recovery. PEAR explicitly tackles three major limitations of existing methods: slow inference, inaccurate localization of fine-grained human pose details, and insufficient facial expression capture. Specifically, to enable real-time SMPLX parameter inference, we depart from prior designs that rely on high resolution inputs or multi-branch architectures. Instead, we adopt a clean and unified ViT-based model capable of recovering coarse 3D human geometry. To compensate for the loss of fine-grained details caused by this simplified architecture, we introduce pixel-level supervision to optimize the geometry, significantly improving the reconstruction accuracy of fine-grained human details. To make this approach practical, we further propose a modular data annotation strategy that enriches the training data and enhances the robustness of the model. Overall, PEAR is a preprocessing-free framework that can simultaneously infer EHM-s (SMPLX and scaled-FLAME) parameters at over 100 FPS. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to previous SMPLX-based approaches.

In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ).

However, despite their ubiquitous use, the exact mechanisms underlying their outstanding performance remain unclear. Different methods for LLM explainability exist, and many are, as a method, not fully understood themselves. We started with the question of how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs, aiming to detect it across different LLM modules (attention heads and input embeddings). For this, we used methods well-established in the literature: (1) probing for token-level relational structures, and (2) feature-mapping using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable properties.\n  Both attempts failed for different methodological reasons: Attention-based explanations collapsed once we tested the core assumption that later-layer representations still correspond to tokens.

Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images.

The risks from failure grow more severe with increasing task scope. It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \\emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \\emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior.

To address this limitation, we adopt a dimensional approach that represents sentiment with continuous valence-arousal (VA) scores, enabling fine-grained analysis at both the aspect and sentiment levels. To this end, we introduce DimABSA, the first multilingual, dimensional ABSA resource annotated with both traditional ABSA elements (aspect terms, aspect categories, and opinion terms) and newly introduced VA scores.

We further introduce three subtasks that combine VA scores with different ABSA elements, providing a bridge from traditional ABSA to dimensional ABSA.

Furthermore, we propose tailored evaluation approaches for each subset: measuring the translation success rate of slang and neologisms in Fun Posts, while assessing tone and style preservation in Social Snippets via a hybrid of embedding-based metrics and LLM-as-a-judge. Experiments on over 20 models reveal substantial variation in how current MT systems handle semantic fidelity and informal, social-media-specific stylistic cues.

Consequently, their reasoning capability is limited when dealing with complex scenes characterized by ambiguity and visual uncertainty. In contrast, human experts, when interpreting remote sensing images in such ambiguous cases, tend to actively query auxiliary images (such as higher-resolution, larger-scale, or temporally adjacent data) to conduct cross-verification and achieve more comprehensive reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a reasoning-query-driven dynamic segmentation framework for FRSIs, named FarmMind. This framework breaks through the limitations of the static segmentation paradigm by introducing a reasoning-query mechanism, which dynamically and on-demand queries external auxiliary images to compensate for the insufficient information in a single input image. Unlike direct queries, this mechanism simulates the thinking process of human experts when faced with segmentation ambiguity: it first analyzes the root causes of segmentation ambiguities through reasoning, and then determines what type of auxiliary image needs to be queried based on this analysis.

To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose DyMo, a new inference-time dynamic modality selection framework that adaptively identifies and integrates reliable recovered modalities, fully exploring task-relevant information beyond the conventional discard-or-impute paradigm. Central to DyMo is a novel selection algorithm that maximizes multimodal task-relevant information for each test sample.

Building on this, a novel principled reward function is proposed to guide modality selection. In addition, we design a flexible multimodal network architecture compatible with arbitrary modality combinations, alongside a tailored training strategy for robust representation learning.

To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention.

Therefore, these approaches often struggle to distinguish anomalies from normal instances, resulting in reduced detection and weak localization performance. In real-world applications, where training data are frequently contaminated with anomalies, such methods fail to deliver reliable performance. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates limited anomaly supervision into the adaptive deviation learning paradigm. We introduce a composite anomaly score that combines three complementary components: a deviation score capturing statistical irregularity, an entropy-based uncertainty score reflecting predictive inconsistency, and a segmentation-based score highlighting spatial abnormality. This unified scoring mechanism enables accurate detection and supports gradient-based localization, providing intuitive and explainable visual evidence of anomalous regions.

In contrast, many deployed systems already produce inexpensive automatic quality-control (QC) signals like model agreement, uncertainty measures, or learned mask-quality scores which can be used for further model training without additional ground-truth annotation. However, these signals can be noisy and biased, making preference-based fine-tuning susceptible to harmful updates. We study Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation from such noisy judges using proposals generated by a supervised base segmenter trained on a small labeled set. We find that outcomes depend strongly on how preference pairs are mined: selecting the judge's top-ranked proposal can improve peak performance when the judge is reliable, but can amplify harmful errors under weaker judges. We propose Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), a segmentation-aware objective which normalizes preference updates by the size of the disagreement region between masks, reducing the leverage of harmful comparisons and improving optimization stability.
