TL;DR: SEEA-R1是一个强化微调框架，旨在提升具身智能体的自我进化能力，通过Tree-GRPO和MGRM解决多步推理和奖励泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化微调在具身智能领域的潜力未充分挖掘，面临中间奖励稀疏和手工奖励函数泛化性差的挑战。

Method: 提出SEEA-R1框架，结合Tree-GRPO（蒙特卡洛树搜索与GRPO）和MGRM（多模态生成奖励模型）。

Result: 在ALFWorld基准测试中表现优异，文本和多模态任务分别达到85.07%和36.19%，超越GPT-4o等模型。

Conclusion: SEEA-R1展示了具身智能体自我进化的潜力，为未来可扩展研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning
and behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon,
real-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential
to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions
remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two
fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible
intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning
signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts
generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we
present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework
designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.
Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate
signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative
policy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into
GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting
autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce
Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the
effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19%
(multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also
achieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all
open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving
embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support
the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.

### [2] [Hierarchical Reasoning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734)
*Guan Wang,Jin Li,Yuhao Sun,Xing Chen,Changling Liu,Yue Wu,Meng Lu,Sen Song,Yasin Abbasi Yadkori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的分层推理模型（HRM），通过两个相互依赖的循环模块实现高效推理，显著减少数据需求和延迟，并在复杂任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）使用的Chain-of-Thought（CoT）技术存在任务分解脆弱、数据需求高和延迟大的问题，HRM受人类大脑分层和多时间尺度处理的启发，旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HRM采用分层循环架构，包含一个负责慢速抽象规划的高层模块和一个处理快速详细计算的底层模块，无需中间过程显式监督，单次前向传播完成推理。

Result: HRM仅需2700万参数和1000个训练样本，在复杂数独和迷宫路径规划等任务中表现近乎完美，并在ARC基准测试中超越更大模型。

Conclusion: HRM展示了在通用计算和推理系统中的潜力，为人工智能推理任务提供了高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action
sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models
(LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from
brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency.
Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain,
we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent
architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining
both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks
in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate
process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module
responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid,
detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves
exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training
samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves
nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku
puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms
much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction
and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general
intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a
transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose
reasoning systems.

### [3] [THE-Tree: Can Tracing Historical Evolution Enhance Scientific Verification and Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21763)
*Xin Wang,Jiyao Liu,Yulong Xiao,Junzhi Ning,Lihao Liu,Junjun He,Botian Shi,Kaicheng Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: THE-Tree框架通过构建科学领域演化树，结合LLM和验证机制，提升科学发展的预测和评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成科学提案的验证瓶颈，传统方法无法满足结构化、因果关联的科学演化数据需求。

Method: 引入THE-Tree框架，通过搜索算法和“Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify”流程构建演化树，验证逻辑和证据支持。

Result: 在88个领域验证THE-Tree，提升图完成和未来预测的准确性，评估重要论文性能提升近100%。

Conclusion: THE-Tree为科学演化提供结构化、可验证的数据支持，显著提升预测和评估能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are accelerating scientific idea generation, but
rigorously evaluating these numerous, often superficial, AI-generated
propositions for novelty and factual accuracy is a critical bottleneck; manual
verification is too slow.Existing validation methods are inadequate: LLMs as
standalone verifiers may hallucinate and lack domain knowledge (our findings
show ~60\% unawareness of relevant papers in specific domains), while
traditional citation networks lack explicit causality and narrative surveys are
unstructured.This underscores a core challenge: the absence of structured,
verifiable, and causally-linked historical data of scientific evolution.To
address this,we introduce \textbf{THE-Tree} (\textbf{T}echnology
\textbf{H}istory \textbf{E}volution Tree), a computational framework that
constructs such domain-specific evolution trees from scientific
literature.THE-Tree employs a search algorithm to explore evolutionary paths.
During its node expansion, it utilizes a novel "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify"
process: an LLM proposes potential advancements and cites supporting
literature. Critically, each proposed evolutionary link is then validated for
logical coherence and evidential support by a recovered natural language
inference mechanism that interrogates the cited literature, ensuring that each
step is grounded.We construct and validate 88 THE-Trees across diverse domains
and release a benchmark dataset including up to 71k fact verifications covering
27k papers to foster further research.Experiments demonstrate that i) in graph
completion, our THE-Tree improves hit@1 by 8\% to 14\% across multiple models
compared to traditional citation networks; ii) for predicting future scientific
developments, it improves hit@1 metric by nearly 10\%; and iii) when combined
with other methods, it boosts the performance of evaluating important
scientific papers by almost 100\%.

TL;DR: MobiVerse是一个混合框架，结合轻量级领域特定生成器和LLMs，用于大规模人类移动模拟，解决了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动模拟平台在算法开发、政策实施和大规模评估方面存在不足，传统方法数据需求高且适应性差。

Method: 提出MobiVerse，结合轻量级生成器生成基础活动链和LLMs进行上下文感知调整。

Result: 在洛杉矶Westwood的案例中，成功为53,000个代理动态调整日程，响应环境反馈，保持计算效率。

Conclusion: MobiVerse填补了移动模拟的空白，提供了可定制平台，兼具计算效率和行为真实性。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility patterns is crucial for effective
transportation planning and urban development. Despite significant advances in
mobility research, there remains a critical gap in simulation platforms that
allow for algorithm development, policy implementation, and comprehensive
evaluation at scale. Traditional activity-based models require extensive data
collection and manual calibration, machine learning approaches struggle with
adaptation to dynamic conditions, and treding agent-based Large Language Models
(LLMs) implementations face computational constraints with large-scale
simulations. To address these challenges, we propose MobiVerse, a hybrid
framework leverages the efficiency of lightweight domain-specific generator for
generating base activity chains with the adaptability of LLMs for context-aware
modifications. A case study was conducted in Westwood, Los Angeles, where we
efficiently generated and dynamically adjusted schedules for the whole
population of approximately 53,000 agents on a standard PC. Our experiments
demonstrate that MobiVerse successfully enables agents to respond to
environmental feedback, including road closures, large gathering events like
football games, and congestion, through our hybrid framework. Its modular
design facilitates testing various mobility algorithms at both transportation
system and agent levels. Results show our approach maintains computational
efficiency while enhancing behavioral realism. MobiVerse bridges the gap in
mobility simulation by providing a customizable platform for mobility systems
planning and operations with benchmark algorithms. Code and videos are
available at https://github.com/ucla-mobility/MobiVerse.

*Nicolas Bougie,Narimasa Watanabe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CitySim利用大语言模型模拟人类行为，通过递归价值驱动方法生成日程，结合信念、长期目标和空间记忆，实现更真实的城市行为模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖刻板规则，难以模拟复杂意图和适应性行为，CitySim旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用递归价值驱动方法，结合信念、长期目标和空间记忆，模拟个体行为。

Result: CitySim在微观和宏观层面均更接近真实人类行为，并能模拟大规模集体行为。

Conclusion: CitySim是一个可扩展、灵活的城市现象理解和预测平台。

Abstract: Modeling human behavior in urban environments is fundamental for social
science, behavioral studies, and urban planning. Prior work often rely on
rigid, hand-crafted rules, limiting their ability to simulate nuanced
intentions, plans, and adaptive behaviors. Addressing these challenges, we
envision an urban simulator (CitySim), capitalizing on breakthroughs in
human-level intelligence exhibited by large language models. In CitySim, agents
generate realistic daily schedules using a recursive value-driven approach that
balances mandatory activities, personal habits, and situational factors. To
enable long-term, lifelike simulations, we endow agents with beliefs, long-term
goals, and spatial memory for navigation. CitySim exhibits closer alignment
with real humans than prior work, both at micro and macro levels. Additionally,
we conduct insightful experiments by modeling tens of thousands of agents and
evaluating their collective behaviors under various real-world scenarios,
including estimating crowd density, predicting place popularity, and assessing
well-being. Our results highlight CitySim as a scalable, flexible testbed for
understanding and forecasting urban phenomena.

### [6] [Interactive Multi-Objective Probabilistic Preference Learning with Soft and Hard Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21887)
*Edward Chen,Sang T. Truong,Natalie Dullerud,Sanmi Koyejo,Carlos Guestrin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Active-MoSH是一个交互式框架，用于在高风险决策中平衡多目标优化，结合软硬边界和偏好学习，提升决策者信任和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高风险决策中多目标优化的挑战，如资源密集型评估和决策者信任问题。

Method: 结合软硬边界与概率偏好学习的局部组件（Active-MoSH）和全局敏感性分析组件（T-MoSH）。

Result: 在合成和实际应用中表现优异，用户研究表明能提升收敛性、信任度和偏好表达能力。

Conclusion: Active-MoSH为高风险决策提供了高效、可信的交互式框架。

Abstract: High-stakes decision-making involves navigating multiple competing objectives
with expensive evaluations. For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must
balance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound
of >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard
bound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being
resource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit
preferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is
computationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive
frameworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain
knowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often
lack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference
structures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they
haven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in
high-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global
framework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard
bounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over
DM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided
by an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while
minimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component,
T-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially
overlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback. We demonstrate
Active-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world
applications. A user study on AI-generated image selection further validates
our hypotheses regarding the framework's ability to improve convergence,
enhance DM trust, and provide expressive preference articulation, enabling more
effective DMs.

### [7] [AlphaBeta is not as good as you think: a new probabilistic model to better analyze deterministic game-solving algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21996)
*Raphaël Boige,Amine Boumaza,Bruno Scherrer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的概率模型，通过引入祖先依赖关系生成更具挑战性的游戏树，分析了AlphaBeta和Scout等算法的平均复杂度，揭示了实际性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型因独立性假设简化了游戏结构，导致算法分析结果过于理想化，无法反映真实挑战。

Method: 引入基于层级条件分布的概率模型，构建具有祖先依赖的游戏树，推导算法的递归复杂度公式。

Result: AlphaBeta在深层树中表现出较大的常数乘数，导致实际性能显著低于Scout等算法。

Conclusion: 新模型为算法分析提供了更现实的框架，揭示了传统模型未捕捉到的性能差异。

Abstract: Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the
light of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random
game-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed
distribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis,
revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse
to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms
achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's
design-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural
complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful
challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model
that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional
distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature
of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable
difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several
algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas
characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us
to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo
simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem
to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of
independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences:
AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared
to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our
framework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering
rigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these
methods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model.

TL;DR: LeanConjecturer是一个基于LLM的自动化数学猜想生成工具，结合规则与LLM生成定理，解决了形式化定理证明中的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形式化定理证明中数据稀缺的挑战，为定理证明系统生成训练数据。

Method: 结合规则上下文提取与LLM生成定理，通过迭代生成和评估生成非平凡猜想。

Result: 从40个Mathlib种子文件生成12,289个猜想，其中3,776个语法有效且非平凡。

Conclusion: LeanConjecturer能高效生成数学猜想，增强定理证明能力，并展示了在拓扑学中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce LeanConjecturer, a pipeline for automatically generating
university-level mathematical conjectures in Lean 4 using Large Language Models
(LLMs). Our hybrid approach combines rule-based context extraction with
LLM-based theorem statement generation, addressing the data scarcity challenge
in formal theorem proving. Through iterative generation and evaluation,
LeanConjecturer produced 12,289 conjectures from 40 Mathlib seed files, with
3,776 identified as syntactically valid and non-trivial, that is, cannot be
proven by \texttt{aesop} tactic. We demonstrate the utility of these generated
conjectures for reinforcement learning through Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), showing that targeted training on domain-specific
conjectures can enhance theorem proving capabilities. Our approach generates
103.25 novel conjectures per seed file on average, providing a scalable
solution for creating training data for theorem proving systems. Our system
successfully verified several non-trivial theorems in topology, including
properties of semi-open, alpha-open, and pre-open sets, demonstrating its
potential for mathematical discovery beyond simple variations of existing
results.

### [9] [Universal Retrieval for Multimodal Trajectory Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22056)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态轨迹检索方法（GAE-Retriever），通过构建统一代理轨迹数据集（UATD）和基准测试（GAE-Bench），解决了轨迹数据建模的挑战，并在检索召回率上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹数据在增强AI代理能力方面潜力巨大，但如何建模轨迹级数据的表示仍是一个未系统解决的挑战。

Method: 构建了UATD数据集和GAE-Bench基准，提出GAE-Retriever框架，结合视觉语言模型和优化的对比学习（如token选择和GradCache机制）。

Result: GAE-Retriever在多个数据集上显著优于基线方法，尤其在检索召回率上表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效推动了多模态轨迹检索的发展，为AI代理能力的提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Trajectory data, capturing human actions and environmental states across
various modalities, holds significant potential for enhancing AI agent
capabilities, particularly in GUI environments. However, how to model the
representation of trajectory-level data presents a significant challenge that
has not been systematically addressed amid explosive trajectory data growth. In
this work, we introduce Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, bridging the gap
between universal retrieval and agent-centric trajectory modeling. We construct
the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and
states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present
GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval
pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework
that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive
learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive
evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently
outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its
effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.

TL;DR: 论文提出“Query as Test”（QaT）概念，通过逻辑查询统一数据表示，解决智能交通领域数据碎片化问题，并提出“Extensible Scenarios Notations”（ESN）框架和“Validation-Driven Development”（VDD）方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能交通领域（智能座舱、自动驾驶、智能路网）数据碎片化和现有测试方法缺乏灵活性的问题。

Method: 提出基于Answer Set Programming（ASP）的ESN框架，统一表示异构数据，并通过逻辑查询实现测试。

Result: ESN框架支持复杂语义查询、提供决策解释性，并实现细粒度隐私保护；QaT范式提升测试表达力和严谨性。

Conclusion: QaT和VDD方法为智能交通系统开发提供了更灵活、高效的测试和验证途径。

Abstract: With the deep penetration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the
transportation sector, intelligent cockpits, autonomous driving, and
intelligent road networks are developing at an unprecedented pace. However, the
data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and
incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail
to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this
paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the
focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries
against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a
fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our
proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative
data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly
represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as
a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep
semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports
complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides
natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for
on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy
protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the
functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving
systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing
the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the
concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide
developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era
of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and
development process.

Conclusion: 提出了五个优先研究方向，为开放、多元和负责任的AI安全学科奠定基础。

Abstract: The rapid rise of open-weight and open-source foundation models is
intensifying the obligation and reshaping the opportunity to make AI systems
safe. This paper reports outcomes from the Columbia Convening on AI Openness
and Safety (San Francisco, 19 Nov 2024) and its six-week preparatory programme
involving more than forty-five researchers, engineers, and policy leaders from
academia, industry, civil society, and government. Using a participatory,
solutions-oriented process, the working groups produced (i) a research agenda
at the intersection of safety and open source AI; (ii) a mapping of existing
and needed technical interventions and open source tools to safely and
responsibly deploy open foundation models across the AI development workflow;
and (iii) a mapping of the content safety filter ecosystem with a proposed
roadmap for future research and development. We find that openness --
understood as transparent weights, interoperable tooling, and public governance
-- can enhance safety by enabling independent scrutiny, decentralized
mitigation, and culturally plural oversight. However, significant gaps persist:
scarce multimodal and multilingual benchmarks, limited defenses against
prompt-injection and compositional attacks in agentic systems, and insufficient
participatory mechanisms for communities most affected by AI harms. The paper
concludes with a roadmap of five priority research directions, emphasizing
participatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety
infrastructure, rigorous agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies.
These recommendations informed the February 2025 French AI Action Summit and
lay groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGC模型在实体数量远大于嵌入维度时，输出层存在秩瓶颈，限制了模型表达能力和性能。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析秩瓶颈的影响，提出KGE-MoS（基于混合的输出层）来打破瓶颈。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，KGE-MoS以较低参数成本提升了KGC模型的性能和概率拟合度。

Conclusion: KGE-MoS有效解决了秩瓶颈问题，提升了KGC模型的表达能力和准确性。

Abstract: Many Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models, despite using powerful
encoders, rely on a simple vector-matrix multiplication to score queries
against candidate object entities. When the number of entities is larger than
the model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by
several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank
bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate
both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We
find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt
ranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the
language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer
to break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models. Our experiments on four datasets
show that KGE-MoS improves performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models for
a low parameter cost.

Result: 强调了将AI自主性作为独立研究焦点的必要性，并初步提出了研究智能不服从的边界。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in recent years,
achieving superhuman performance across a wide range of tasks. Yet despite
these advances, most cooperative AI systems remain rigidly obedient, designed
to follow human instructions without question and conform to user expectations,
even when doing so may be counterproductive or unsafe. This paper argues for
expanding the agency of AI teammates to include \textit{intelligent
disobedience}, empowering them to make meaningful and autonomous contributions
within human-AI teams. It introduces a scale of AI agency levels and uses
representative examples to highlight the importance and growing necessity of
treating AI autonomy as an independent research focus in cooperative settings.
The paper then explores how intelligent disobedience manifests across different
autonomy levels and concludes by proposing initial boundaries and
considerations for studying disobedience as a core capability of artificial
agents.

Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection
infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient
data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing
large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic
structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to
provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data
structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and
visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and
file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that
offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution.
In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based
aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset
composition than existing topic modeling techniques.

Abstract: This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or
physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their
environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices,
and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings,
which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the
environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development
of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents,
allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to
understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability
to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the
integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and
control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical
world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world
model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.

Conclusion: AI Model Passport为AI驱动的医疗解决方案设定了新标准，增强了信任和问责，有望成为跨领域透明合规AI系统的基础。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into health and
biomedical systems necessitates robust frameworks for transparency,
accountability, and ethical compliance. Existing frameworks often rely on
human-readable, manual documentation which limits scalability, comparability,
and machine interpretability across projects and platforms. They also fail to
provide a unique, verifiable identity for AI models to ensure their provenance
and authenticity across systems and use cases, limiting reproducibility and
stakeholder trust. This paper introduces the concept of the AI Model Passport,
a structured and standardized documentation framework that acts as a digital
identity and verification tool for AI models. It captures essential metadata to
uniquely identify, verify, trace and monitor AI models across their lifecycle -
from data acquisition and preprocessing to model design, development and
deployment. In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented
through AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project
for medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection,
ensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and
integrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is
showcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the
ProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances
transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual
effort. This approach aims to set a new standard for fostering trust and
accountability in AI-driven healthcare solutions, aspiring to serve as the
basis for developing transparent and regulation compliant AI systems across
domains.

Motivation: 评估AI代理在科学复现中的能力，推动LLM在科学研究中的应用。

Method: 基于NanoGPT速度竞赛设计19个任务，提供不同提示格式，测试LLM复现能力。

Result: 当前LLM即使结合先进框架也难以复现已知创新。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为衡量LLM自动化科学复现能力提供了简单有效的工具。

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to
assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is
the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to
reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM
Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the
NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.
Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records
training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from
pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records
execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse
code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to
hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible
and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that
recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement
already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our
benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to
automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an
autonomous research agent.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在细粒度空间推理和多步逻辑对齐方面表现不足。

Method: 提出M3CTS生成多样且逻辑一致的LongCoT轨迹，并设计fDPO引入细粒度偏好优化。

Result: fDPO在空间质量和数量任务上分别提升4.1%和9.0%，SpatialReasoner-R1在SPATIALRGPT-Bench上领先9.8%。

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner-R1在空间推理任务上表现优异，同时保持通用视觉语言任务的竞争力。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial
reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are
required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language
reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct
high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte
Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent
Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose
fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces
segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical
reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate
responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical
coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average
improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0%
gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a
new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in
average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general
vision-language tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在全景图像生成中面临几何失真和循环一致性等独特挑战，需要一种新方法来克服这些问题。

Method: TanDiT使用统一的扩散模型在单次去噪迭代中同时生成切平面图像，并提出模型无关的后处理步骤以增强全局一致性。

Result: 实验表明，TanDiT能有效泛化训练数据之外的内容，处理复杂文本提示，并与其他生成模型无缝集成，生成高质量全景图像。

Conclusion: TanDiT通过创新的切平面图像生成和后处理步骤，显著提升了全景图像生成的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in
synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with
panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels
of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To
address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we
introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating
grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike
previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a
unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images
simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a
model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global
coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image
quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and
provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and
standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets
detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various
generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的视觉裁剪方法，利用MLLM内部表征指导搜索最相关图像区域，显著提升细粒度VQA任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉裁剪方法需要任务特定微调、效率低或与高效注意力实现不兼容的问题。

Method: 通过四步实现：识别目标对象、计算对象相关性图、提出并排名相关区域、使用排名最高区域执行VQA任务。

Result: 在四个细粒度VQA数据集和两种MLLM上表现优异，优于三种流行方法，计算量减少3-6.5倍。

Conclusion: FOCUS在准确性和效率上均优于现有方法，为细粒度VQA任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and
reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA)
focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual
cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:
the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed
exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.
We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping
method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the
search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:
first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute
an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and
rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the
fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed
search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA
datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping
methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing
baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CAST的统一模型，通过跨注意力机制更有效地融合时空特征，提升了深度伪造视频检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有CNN-Transformer模型在时空特征融合上存在局限性，需要更高效的检测方法。

Method: 提出CAST模型，利用跨注意力机制动态融合时空特征，增强对细微时间演化伪造痕迹（如闪烁的眼睛或扭曲的嘴唇）的检测能力。

Result: 在FaceForensics++、Celeb-DF和DeepfakeDetection数据集上表现出色，AUC达99.49%，准确率97.57%；跨数据集测试中AUC为93.31%。

Conclusion: 跨注意力机制显著提升了深度伪造检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity,
increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle
and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial
artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.
However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal
features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use
separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine
them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which
limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we
propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse
spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows
temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing
the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as
flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization
and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across
diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model
using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both
intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.
Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an
accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset
testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent
AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the
effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the
robustness of deepfake video detection.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像修复任务中表现优异，但其复杂架构和迭代过程限制了实际应用。现有方法忽视了将扩散训练范式融入普通IR框架的可能性。

Method: 通过分析时间步依赖、网络层次等关键因素，提出新的IR框架，并引入正则化策略和增量训练范式，以优化单任务和多任务IR。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了单任务IR的泛化能力，并在多任务统一IR中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架可无缝集成到现有普通IR架构中，为扩散训练范式在IR任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image
restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes
limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based
general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing
network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the
diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address
these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the
diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis
of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and
multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by
diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore
images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of
regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,
improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing
that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR
tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,
further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in
single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.
Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing
general IR architectures.

Result: 在ScanObjectNN上达到90.53%的准确率，预训练后提升至93.72%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AsymDSD通过潜在空间预测和多掩码采样等设计，显著提升了3D点云语义表示的性能。

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point
clouds remains a central challenge in computer vision, especially in the
absence of large-scale labeled datasets. While masked point modeling (MPM) is
widely used in self-supervised 3D learning, its reconstruction-based objective
can limit its ability to capture high-level semantics. We propose AsymDSD, an
Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework that unifies masked modeling and
invariance learning through prediction in the latent space rather than the
input space. AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces
several key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention
between masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a
point cloud adaptation of multi-crop. AsymDSD achieves state-of-the-art results
on ScanObjectNN (90.53%) and further improves to 93.72% when pretrained on 930k
shapes, surpassing prior methods.

Motivation: 探索概率生成模型的局限性，特别是全局分布学习导致记忆而非生成行为的问题。

Method: 提出MESP框架和基于重叠系数的下界，设计BL-AE编码二进制潜在表示，并开发ARVM模型输出直方图。LCH假设局部相关性是生成能力的关键。

Result: ARVM在标准数据集上取得竞争性FID分数，但分数反映记忆问题。LCH假设通过实验验证。

Conclusion: MESP和LCH框架揭示了概率生成模型的局限性，并提出了局部相关性对生成能力的重要性。

Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability
Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential
limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global
distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP
emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe
that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an
optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A
lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this
phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary
Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent
representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our
Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model
outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect
memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the
Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability
arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive
experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了ImplicitQA，一个专注于测试视频问答系统中隐式推理能力的新基准，填补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答基准主要关注显式视觉内容，而忽略了人类擅长的隐式推理能力，如动机、因果关系等。

Method: 构建了包含1K高质量QA对的ImplicitQA基准，涵盖多种隐式推理维度，如空间、运动、社交等。

Result: 评估显示当前模型在隐式推理任务上表现不佳，依赖表面视觉线索。

Conclusion: ImplicitQA为社区提供了新挑战，促进视频问答系统的进一步发展。

Abstract: Video QA has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to
align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly
focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,
objects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.
In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and
narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately
omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and
relationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such
implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context
to construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail
to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this
gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test
models on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs
derived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized
into key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth
and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and
motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred
counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors
ensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models
reveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level
visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. Performance
variations across models further illustrate the complexity and diversity of the
challenges presented by ImplicitQA. By releasing both the dataset and our data
collection framework, we aim to stimulate further research and development in
the community. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection
can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods
are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present
a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma

minimal preprocessing yields higher AUC-ROC compared to more complex
enhancements, and our model demonstrates strong discriminative performance on
unseen datasets. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible and scalable
approach to early glaucoma detection, supporting its potential clinical
utility.

examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM

highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain.
Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these
specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in
adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our
evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the

Conclusion: CAT-SG数据集和CatSGG模型为AI驱动的临床实践（如手术培训和实时决策支持）提供了更智能、上下文感知的系统基础。

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling
complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and
procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of
surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack
comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between
entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph
(CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue
interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By
incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of
surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and
techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model,
CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical
representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical
training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for
more intelligent, context-aware systems in clinical practice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型视觉基础模型和参数高效微调的少样本历史地图分割方法，性能优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图作为丰富的历史资源，其多样化的视觉表现和有限的标注数据给自动化处理带来了挑战。

Method: 结合大型视觉基础模型的语义嵌入和参数高效微调，实现少样本分割。

Result: 在Siegfried数据集上，10-shot和5-shot场景下分别提升5%和13%的mIoU；在ICDAR 2021数据集上达到67.3%的PQ。

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了对人工标注的需求，推动了历史地图的自动化处理与分析。

Abstract: As rich sources of history, maps provide crucial insights into historical
changes, yet their diverse visual representations and limited annotated data
pose significant challenges for automated processing. We propose a simple yet
effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the
rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on
the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving
+5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20%
in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong
performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3%
for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this
shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our
approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- &
5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the
total model size. Our approach enables precise segmentation of diverse
historical maps while drastically reducing the need for manual annotations,
advancing automated processing and analysis in the field. Our implementation is

Abstract: Storytelling is a deeply personal and creative process, yet existing methods
often treat users as passive consumers, offering generic plots with limited
personalization. This undermines engagement and immersion, especially where
individual style or appearance is crucial. We introduce TaleForge, a
personalized story-generation system that integrates large language models
(LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion to embed users' facial images within both
narratives and illustrations. TaleForge features three interconnected modules:
Story Generation, where LLMs create narratives and character descriptions from
user prompts; Personalized Image Generation, merging users' faces and outfit
choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene
backdrops that incorporate personalized characters. A user study demonstrated
heightened engagement and ownership when individuals appeared as protagonists.
Participants praised the system's real-time previews and intuitive controls,
though they requested finer narrative editing tools. TaleForge advances
multimodal storytelling by aligning personalized text and imagery to create
immersive, user-centric experiences.

Motivation: 医学图像修复（如息肉图像）的准确性对诊断至关重要，现有模型可能生成不准确图像，需专家标注以提高可靠性。

Method: 提出PrefPaint，将人类反馈融入Stable Diffusion Inpainting训练过程，开发基于Web的交互界面简化训练和微调。

Result: PrefPaint在多个领域优于现有方法，减少视觉不一致性，尤其在医学图像中生成更真实的息肉图像。

Conclusion: PrefPaint通过人类反馈和交互界面显著提升医学图像修复的可靠性和用户体验。

Abstract: Inpainting, the process of filling missing or corrupted image parts, has
broad applications, including medical imaging. However, in specialized fields
like medical polyps imaging, where accuracy and reliability are critical,
inpainting models can generate inaccurate images, leading to significant errors
in medical diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliability, medical images
should be annotated by experts like oncologists for effective model training.
We propose PrefPaint, an approach that incorporates human feedback into the
training process of Stable Diffusion Inpainting, bypassing the need for
computationally expensive reward models. In addition, we develop a web-based
interface streamlines training, fine-tuning, and inference. This interactive
interface provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easier to
offer feedback and manage the fine-tuning process. User study on various
domains shows that PrefPaint outperforms existing methods, reducing visual
inconsistencies and improving image rendering, particularly in medical
contexts, where our model generates more realistic polyps images.

TL;DR: ProSAM提出了一种改进的视觉参考分割方法，通过变分提示编码器预测多变量提示分布，解决了现有SAM方法在边界生成提示导致的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAM方法在视觉参考分割中因提示编码器不理想，常在物体边界生成提示，导致不稳定性和鲁棒性下降。

Method: ProSAM通过学习变分提示编码器预测多变量提示分布，避免在不稳定区域生成提示。

Result: 在Pascal-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上，ProSAM表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProSAM为视觉参考分割提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of
open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond
predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes,
texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its
unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several
SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically
generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts
at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in
instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple
but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in
existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a
variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM
avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the
instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets,
providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

Motivation: 随着RGB-IR图像对在智能监控等应用中的广泛使用，数据存储和传输成本成倍增加，因此需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 设计了CCEM模型，包含LCEB和LCFB模块，用于提取和融合跨模态的低频信息，优化熵参数预测。

Result: 在LLVIP和KAIST数据集上优于现有RGB-IR和单模态压缩方法，例如在LLVIP上比特率节省23.1%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过跨模态信息利用显著提升了RGB-IR图像对的压缩效率。

Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in
various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of
modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also
double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work
proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to
fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability
modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise
Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context
Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are
designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information
from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters
more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and
KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate
saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec
presented at CVPR 2022.

Motivation: 解决低光照图像在不同条件下的显著变化以及增强效果受主观偏好影响的问题。

Method: 在傅里叶频域中结合深度强化学习，引入零参考图像评估策略进行训练，并在推理阶段采用个性化自适应迭代策略。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现了更高的感知质量和个性化适应性。

Conclusion: ReF-LLE为低光照图像增强提供了一种高效且个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement presents two primary challenges: 1) Significant
variations in low-light images across different conditions, and 2) Enhancement
levels influenced by subjective preferences and user intent. To address these
issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement
method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep
reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement
learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation
strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that
guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively.
In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative
strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which
represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to
adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution
of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and
adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.

TL;DR: 提出一种创新的EEG编码器架构，结合双重自注意力机制，通过混合训练策略和变分评分蒸馏，成功从EEG数据生成3D对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅将脑电图（EEG）数据转换为2D图像，忽略了3D信息，限制了脑机接口（BCI）的实际应用。人类大脑处理的是3D空间信息，因此需要从EEG数据中重建3D对象。

Method: 提出一种创新的EEG编码器架构，结合双重自注意力机制，采用混合训练策略（包括交叉注意力、对比学习和自监督学习），并利用稳定扩散作为先验分布，通过变分评分蒸馏训练神经辐射场。

Result: 成功从EEG数据生成了内容和结构相似的3D对象。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了EEG信号噪声和数据集稀缺的挑战，为从EEG数据重建3D对象提供了有效解决方案，扩展了BCI的应用潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds
significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and
aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have
focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation
of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain
inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of
whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured
by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when
reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.
The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable
obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and
a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which
complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this
challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that
integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy
to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning,
and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable
diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation
to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with
similar content and structure from EEG data.

<details>

Motivation: 从面部视频中捕捉周期性信号（如皮肤色调变化）对rPPG估计至关重要，但现有方法缺乏通用表示学习。

Method: 使用视频掩码自编码器学习时空表示，结合帧掩码和生理带宽限制约束。

Result: 在PURE、UBFC-rPPG等数据集上表现优异，尤其在跨数据集评估中显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习有效捕捉周期性信号，为rPPG任务提供了通用表示。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that learns a general representation of
periodic signals from unlabeled facial videos by capturing subtle changes in
skin tone over time. The proposed framework employs the video masked
autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional spatio-temporal representation of the
facial region through self-supervised learning. Capturing quasi-periodic
signals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
estimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms
of video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic
signals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates
physiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological
signals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to
the model. The pre-trained encoder is then transferred to the rPPG task, where
it is used to extract physiological signals from facial videos. We evaluate the
proposed method through extensive experiments on the PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and
V4V datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements,
particularly in challenging cross-dataset evaluations. Our code is available at

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep
learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various
pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches
integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the
comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial
transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular
heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce
SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide
image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an
ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique,
where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive
learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene
expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is
evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot
performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of
integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

Motivation: 人脸对齐任务中，误差分布存在偏差（沿切线方向扩散），且与标注模糊性相关，需针对性解决。

Method: 提出ADL（各向异性方向损失）和AAM（各向异性注意力模块），分别用于坐标和热图回归，互补学习人脸结构和纹理细节。

Result: ADNet在300W、WFLW和COFW数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: ADL和AAM有效解决了误差偏差问题，提升了模型收敛性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment
performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with
respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we
investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of
landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This
error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous
landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage
the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we
propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)
for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding
force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the
other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask
focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent
points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means
relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary
manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we
integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our
ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which
demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.

Motivation: 现有方法基于注意力分数压缩令牌，但无法有效捕捉所有语义区域且易导致冗余。

Method: 提出两步骤时空令牌压缩策略，利用SCC在空间和时间域分配令牌，确保语义覆盖。

Result: 在多种视频理解基准测试中表现优异，尤其在低令牌保留率下。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Scissor在令牌压缩和视频理解任务中优于其他方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression
strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods
mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to
effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy.
Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC)
approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set,
ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step
spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial
and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by
representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We
conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of
LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video
question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor
outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in
various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention
ratios. Project page: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/LLaVA-Scissor.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant growth of face alignment. Though
dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic
medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face
alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich
landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68
points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches
along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose
a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse
landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile,
several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea.
Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing
face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense
landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only
in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W
and WFLW testsets without additional cost.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在自然图像领域表现优异，但在遥感（RS）领域由于视觉外观、对象尺度和语义的显著差异，应用受限。

Method: 提出两个核心组件：1）基于检索的语义增强模块，用于多级视觉特征对齐；2）语义感知专家建模，分层次处理不同级别的语义表示。

Conclusion: 该框架有效弥补了通用LVLM与RS特定需求之间的差距，展示了其在RS视觉语言理解中的能力和有效性。

Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
various vision-language tasks in natural image domains. However, their
application to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant
domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These
discrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain
rich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.
Hence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To
address this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS
understanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented
Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align
multi-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic
Augmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics
across fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is
designed to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge
database, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and
multi-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation
across multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design
semantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic
representation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical
semantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple
RS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic
levels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap
between general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language
understanding.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion plays a critical role in enhancing perception for
autonomous driving, overcoming individual sensor limitations, and enabling
comprehensive environmental understanding. This paper first formalizes
multi-sensor fusion strategies into data-level, feature-level, and
decision-level categories and then provides a systematic review of deep

Conclusion: DPU-Former通过高效融合长程依赖和空间细节，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Automatically segmenting objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs)
is an important task. Most existing models are primarily based on either
convolutional or Transformer features, each offering distinct advantages.
Exploiting both advantages is valuable research, but it presents several
challenges, including the heterogeneity between the two types of features, high
complexity, and large parameters of the model. However, these issues are often
overlooked in existing the ORSIs methods, causing sub-optimal segmentation. For
that, we propose a novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) with
a unique structure designed to simultaneously integrate long-range dependencies
and spatial details. In particular, we design the global-local mixed attention,
which captures diverse information through two perspectives and introduces a
Fourier-space merging strategy to obviate deviations for efficient fusion.
Furthermore, we present a gated linear feed-forward network to increase the
expressive ability. Additionally, we construct a DPU-Former decoder to
aggregate and strength features at different layers. Consequently, the
DPU-Former model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多视图约束显著提升了配准性能，适用于术中导航。

Abstract: Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns preoperative models with
intraoperative images of the same anatomy, is crucial for successful
interventional navigation. To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view
in single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is
required by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two
stages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating
both the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the
dissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and
observed intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view
training loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly
enforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is
performed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method
exploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the
robustness of the registration process. The proposed framework achieves a mean
target registration error (mTRE) of $0.79 \pm 2.17$ mm on six specimens from
the DeepFluoro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

Abstract: Geologic map, as a fundamental diagram in geology science, provides critical
insights into the structure and composition of Earth's subsurface and surface.
These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection,
resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance,
current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic
map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of
cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map,
managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific
knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses
the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and
analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent
designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules:
Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI),
and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the
interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts
as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze
questions. Through comprehensive experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves an overall
score of 0.811 on GeoMap-Bench, significantly outperforming 0.369 of GPT-4o.
Our work, emPowering gEologic mAp holistiC undErstanding (PEACE) with MLLMs,

Motivation: 视觉标记剪枝虽能降低计算成本，但会严重削弱模型的视觉定位能力，导致性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP)，通过简单调整位置ID来恢复剪枝后的性能。

Result: GAP将LLaVA在RefCOCO验证集上的准确率从剪枝后的15.34%恢复到51.42%，接近原始性能的90%。

Conclusion: GAP是一种无需额外训练或计算开销的有效方法，适用于多种模型和剪枝策略。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface
for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the
development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs
associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that
pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to
incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of
LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis
identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this
degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for
maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose
Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to
position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the
original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no
additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such
as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves
performance across various token pruning strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银屑病严重程度评分在临床试验中重要，但存在评分者间变异性和临床评估负担。远程成像虽具扩展性，但受光照、背景和设备质量等影响，降低自动化评分的可靠性。

Method: 采用基于梯度的解释性方法，追踪误分类验证图像的梯度，检测训练样本中的不一致评分或非临床伪影。应用于基于ConvNeXT的弱监督模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测训练数据中的不一致性，减少人工审核需求，提升远程评估的自动化评分鲁棒性。

Abstract: Psoriasis (PsO) severity scoring is important for clinical trials but is
hindered by inter-rater variability and the burden of in person clinical
evaluation. Remote imaging using patient captured mobile photos offers
scalability but introduces challenges, such as variation in lighting,
background, and device quality that are often imperceptible to humans but can
impact model performance. These factors, along with inconsistencies in
dermatologist annotations, reduce the reliability of automated severity
scoring. We propose a framework to automatically flag problematic training
images that introduce spurious correlations which degrade model generalization,
using a gradient based interpretability approach. By tracing the gradients of
misclassified validation images, we detect training samples where model errors
align with inconsistently rated examples or are affected by subtle, nonclinical
artifacts. We apply this method to a ConvNeXT based weakly supervised model
designed to classify PsO severity from phone images. Removing 8.2% of flagged
images improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.
Commonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation
accuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training
images with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for
manual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two
dermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater
disagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples. This improves automated
scoring for remote assessments, ensuring robustness despite data collection
variability.

Result: 实验表明，SODA在无需额外训练的情况下，在多个数据集和问题设置中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SODA方法有效解决了合成到现实领域偏移对3D VLM性能的影响，显著提升了OOD点云检测能力。

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes
critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem
remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image
domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)
for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that
point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size
and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they
often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a
substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks
involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,
our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift
significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text
embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To
address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the
detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation
scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets
and problem settings.

Abstract: Recently the emergence of novel presentation attacks has drawn increasing
attention to face anti-spoofing. However, existing methods tend to memorize
data patterns from the training set, resulting in poor generalization to
unknown attack types across different scenarios and limited interpretability.
To address these challenges, this paper presents a reinforcement
fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method that stimulates the capabilities of
multimodal large language models to think and learn how to solve the
anti-spoofing task itself, rather than relying on the memorization of
authenticity patterns. We design verifiable class consistent reward and
reasoning consistent reward, and employ a GRPO-based optimization strategy to
guide the model in exploring reasoning policies from multiple perspectives to
maximize expected rewards. As a result, through iterative trial-and-error
learning while retaining only high-reward trajectories, the model distills
highly generalizable decision-making rules from the extensive solution space to
effectively address cross-domain face anti-spoofing tasks. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
cross-domain generalization performance. It generalizes well to diverse unknown
attack types in unseen target domains while providing interpretable reasoning
for its authenticity decisions without requiring labor-intensive textual
annotations for training.

Abstract: Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures
supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on
enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,
searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual
elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension,
retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential
for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is
that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is
challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,
tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard
structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be
composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep
learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory
performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity
of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for
detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art
object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video
datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently
YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple
benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.
Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general
solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper
contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video
frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation has recently attracted considerable
attention, allowing models to generate human motions based on textual
descriptions. However, current methods neglect the influence of human
attributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors
shaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for
bridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute
information and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively
with action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural
Causal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,
enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation. The
resulting model is capable of generating realistic, attribute-aware motion
aligned with the user's text and attribute inputs. For evaluation, we introduce
HumanAttr, a comprehensive dataset containing attribute annotations for
text-motion pairs, setting the first benchmark for attribute-aware
text-to-motion generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset validate
our model's effectiveness.

Abstract: The automated reconstruction of the logical arrangement of tables from image
data, termed Table Structure Recognition (TSR), is fundamental for semantic
data extraction. Recently, researchers have explored a wide range of techniques
to tackle this problem, demonstrating significant progress. Each table is a set
of vertical and horizontal separators. Following this realization, we present
SepFormer, which integrates the split-and-merge paradigm into a single step
through separator regression with a DETR-style architecture, improving speed
and robustness. SepFormer is a coarse-to-fine approach that predicts table
separators from single-line to line-strip separators with a stack of two
transformer decoders. In the coarse-grained stage, the model learns to
gradually refine single-line segments through decoder layers with additional
angle loss. At the end of the fine-grained stage, the model predicts line-strip
separators by refining sampled points from each single-line segment. Our
SepFormer can run on average at 25.6 FPS while achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR,
PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

Abstract: Histological analysis plays a crucial role in understanding tissue structure
and pathology. While recent advancements in registration methods have improved
2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial
relationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research
applications. Specifically, constructing accurate 3D models from 2D slices
remains challenging due to tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts,
variability in imaging techniques, and inconsistent illumination. Deep
learning-based registration methods have demonstrated improved performance but
suffer from limited generalizability and require large-scale training data. In
contrast, non-deep-learning approaches offer better generalizability but often
compromise on accuracy. In this study, we introduced ZeroReg3D, a novel
zero-shot registration pipeline tailored for accurate 3D reconstruction from
serial histological sections. By combining zero-shot deep learning-based
keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration
techniques, ZeroReg3D effectively addresses critical challenges such as tissue
deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent
illumination without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The code has been

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize target objects within a 3D scene
based on natural language queries. To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D
training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the
extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and
VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based)
or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex
real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent
that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first
holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal
viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to
perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore,
leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is
efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging
spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot
grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0%
and 10.9% in accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC) techniques, AI generated images (AIGIs) have attracted widespread
attention, among which AI generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) hold
significant potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. AI generated omnidirectional images exhibit unique quality
issues, however, research on the quality assessment and optimization of
AI-generated omnidirectional images is still lacking. To this end, this work
first studies the quality assessment and distortion-aware saliency prediction
problems for AIGODIs, and further presents a corresponding optimization
process. Specifically, we first establish a comprehensive database to reflect
human feedback for AI-generated omnidirectionals, termed OHF2024, which
includes both subjective quality ratings evaluated from three perspectives and
distortion-aware salient regions. Based on the constructed OHF2024 database, we
propose two models with shared encoders based on the BLIP-2 model to evaluate
the human visual experience and predict distortion-aware saliency for
AI-generated omnidirectional images, which are named as BLIP2OIQA and
BLIP2OISal, respectively. Finally, based on the proposed models, we present an
automatic optimization process that utilizes the predicted visual experience
scores and distortion regions to further enhance the visual quality of an
AI-generated omnidirectional image. Extensive experiments show that our
BLIP2OIQA model and BLIP2OISal model achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
the human visual experience evaluation task and the distortion-aware saliency
prediction task for AI generated omnidirectional images, and can be effectively
used in the optimization process. The database and codes will be released on
https://github.com/IntMeGroup/AIGCOIQA to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像的语义分割面临类别差异、遮挡和物体尺寸变化的挑战，需要深度学习模型学习鲁棒特征并生成足够的特征描述符。

Method: 采用两个堆叠的编码器-解码器网络结合扩张残差块（DRB），以捕获长距离语义并保留空间信息。

Result: 在ISPRS Vaihingen和Potsdam数据集上的实验表明，SDRNet在语义分割中表现优异。

Conclusion: SDRNet能够有效解决高分辨率遥感图像分割中的挑战，性能优于现有深度卷积神经网络。

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution
remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote
sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed
(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become
available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is
greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key
ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the
extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image
feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS
images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These
challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and
generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning
multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes
from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class
disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly
lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor
segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked
deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The
proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness
long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual
blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient
global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental
results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate
that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in
semantic segmentation.

Result: 在ScanObjectNN、ModelNet40和ShapeNetPart等数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了点云理解中语义关系的捕捉能力，并在下游任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Point cloud understanding aims to acquire robust and general feature
representations from unlabeled data. Masked point modeling-based methods have
recently shown significant performance across various downstream tasks. These
pre-training methods rely on random masking strategies to establish the
perception of point clouds by restoring corrupted point cloud inputs, which
leads to the failure of capturing reasonable semantic relationships by the
self-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Masked
Autoencoder, which comprises two main components: a prototype-based component
semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy.
Specifically, in the component semantic modeling module, we design a component
semantic guidance mechanism to direct a set of learnable prototypes in
capturing the semantics of different components from objects. Leveraging these
prototypes, we develop a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy that
addresses the limitations of random masking in effectively covering complete
component structures. Furthermore, we introduce a component semantic-enhanced
prompt-tuning strategy, which further leverages these prototypes to improve the
performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
conducted on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

TL;DR: 提出TASeg框架，通过LoRA微调技术结合RGB-T图像和文本信息，解决现有语义分割模型在视觉相似类别上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-T语义分割模型依赖低层视觉特征，缺乏高层文本信息，导致视觉相似类别分割不准确；SAM在多模态融合和计算效率上存在不足。

Method: 采用LoRA微调技术，提出动态特征融合模块（DFFM）融合多模态视觉特征，并引入CLIP文本嵌入提升语义对齐。

Result: 在多样化数据集上表现优异，尤其在挑战性场景中，且训练参数更少。

Conclusion: TASeg框架通过结合视觉和文本信息，显著提升了语义分割的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation of open environments is essential for
intelligent systems, yet significant problems remain: 1) Existing RGB-T
semantic segmentation models mainly rely on low-level visual features and lack
high-level textual information, which struggle with accurate segmentation when
categories share similar visual characteristics. 2) While SAM excels in
instance-level segmentation, integrating it with thermal images and text is
hindered by modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency. To address
these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation
models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the
image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual
modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we
incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable
semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and
improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across
diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in
challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉单目标跟踪方法R1-Track，通过GRPO强化学习方法微调Qwen2.5-VL，在GOT-10k基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跟踪方法依赖大规模监督训练且缺乏灵活性，而MLLMs在基础任务中表现优异，但直接应用于跟踪任务效果不佳。

Method: 使用GRPO强化学习方法在小规模数据集上微调Qwen2.5-VL，生成模型R1-Track。

Result: R1-Track在GOT-10k基准上表现优异，支持灵活初始化（边界框或文本描述），并保留原模型通用能力。

Conclusion: R1-Track展示了MLLMs在视觉跟踪任务中的潜力，未来仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the
scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in
the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching
problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters,
two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress
achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and
regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets,
and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent
years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly.
Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational
capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has
spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However,
experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between
image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned
Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement
learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The
resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k
benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text
descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.
And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough
technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了长时程视频生成中的误差问题，提升了视频质量和任务执行的一致性。

Abstract: We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic
manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant
progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but
struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion
models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot
planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving
one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon,
leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need
for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold
contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic
tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second
diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames,
achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving
attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a
lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated
videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in
video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on
long-horizon tasks.

Motivation: 现代深度神经网络（DNNs）的复杂性和规模快速增长，导致计算成本和内存使用问题突出，亟需高效的模型压缩技术。现有基于线性力矩的方法剪枝效果不理想，网络仍较密集且精度下降明显。

Method: 提出指数力矩剪枝（ETP），采用指数力应用方案进行正则化，有效剪除冗余和远距离模块，保留必要模块。

Result: 实验表明，ETP在多个领域显著提高了压缩率，且精度下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: ETP是一种简单高效的剪枝方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成高保真、美观的面部风格化效果，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需复杂网络设计或额外训练，即可实现灵活的多模态和参考引导风格化。

Abstract: Facial stylization aims to transform facial images into appealing,
high-quality stylized portraits, with the critical challenge of accurately
learning the target style while maintaining content consistency with the
original image. Although previous StyleGAN-based methods have made significant
advancements, the generated results still suffer from artifacts or insufficient
fidelity to the source image. We argue that these issues stem from neglecting
semantic shift of the generator during stylization. Therefore, we propose a
facial stylization method that integrates semantic preservation constraint and
pseudo-paired supervision to enhance the content correspondence and improve the
stylization effect. Additionally, we develop a methodology for creating
multi-level pseudo-paired datasets to implement supervisory constraint.
Furthermore, building upon our facial stylization framework, we achieve more
flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex network
architecture designs or additional training. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach produces high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style
transfer that surpasses previous methods.

Abstract: Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains
a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime
ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,
law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking
methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer
low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have
short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable
for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,
we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship
Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical
and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables
all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship
captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different
satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we
propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS,
which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch
embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates
additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs
contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs,
ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features. Our
dataset and baseline method are publicly available on

Conclusion: Chimera-Seg和SGD有效解决了零样本语义分割中的关键问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen
classes using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based
methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of
vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such
knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning
vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial
precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between
CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of
segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which
integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head
as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision
with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable
segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features
into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed
projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight
trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with
the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the
mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose
Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense
features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually
reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.
Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense
visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text
encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in
hIoU.

Abstract: Reconstruction and rendering-based talking head synthesis methods achieve
high-quality results with strong identity preservation but are limited by their
dependence on identity-specific models. Each new identity requires training
from scratch, incurring high computational costs and reduced scalability
compared to generative model-based approaches. To overcome this limitation, we
propose FIAG, a novel 3D speaking head synthesis framework that enables
efficient identity-specific adaptation using only a few training footage. FIAG
incorporates Global Gaussian Field, which supports the representation of
multiple identities within a shared field, and Universal Motion Field, which
captures the common motion dynamics across diverse identities. Benefiting from
the shared facial structure information encoded in the Global Gaussian Field
and the general motion priors learned in the motion field, our framework
enables rapid adaptation from canonical identity representations to specific
ones with minimal data. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches,
validating both the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Code is available at: \textit{https://github.com/gme-hong/FIAG}.

Abstract: Linear measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in the Parasternal Long Axis
(PLAX) view using B-mode echocardiography are crucial for cardiac assessment.
These involve placing 4-6 landmarks along a virtual scanline (SL) perpendicular
to the LV axis near the mitral valve tips. Manual placement is time-consuming
and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks,
causing inaccurate measurements. We propose a novel framework that enhances LV
measurement accuracy by enforcing straight-line constraints. A landmark
detector is trained on Anatomical M-Mode (AMM) images, computed in real time
from B-mode videos, then transformed back to B-mode space. This approach
addresses misalignment and reduces measurement errors. Experiments show
improved accuracy over standard B-mode methods, and the framework generalizes
well across network architectures. Our semi-automatic design includes a
human-in-the-loop step where the user only places the SL, simplifying
interaction while preserving alignment flexibility and clinical relevance.

Conclusion: MirrorMe通过创新设计和渐进训练，实现了实时高保真音频驱动肖像动画，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation, which synthesizes realistic videos from
reference images using audio signals, faces significant challenges in real-time
generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations. While recent
diffusion-based methods improve generation quality by integrating audio into
denoising processes, their reliance on frame-by-frame UNet architectures
introduces prohibitive latency and struggles with temporal consistency. This
paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX
video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and
temporally for efficient latent space denoising. To address LTX's trade-offs
between compression and semantic fidelity, we propose three innovations: 1. A
reference identity injection mechanism via VAE-encoded image concatenation and
self-attention, ensuring identity consistency; 2. A causal audio encoder and
adapter tailored to LTX's temporal structure, enabling precise audio-expression
synchronization; and 3. A progressive training strategy combining close-up
facial training, half-body synthesis with facial masking, and hand pose
integration for enhanced gesture control. Extensive experiments on the EMTD
Benchmark demonstrate MirrorMe's state-of-the-art performance in fidelity,
lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for estimating the relative pose between rolling
shutter cameras using the intersections of line projections with a single
scanline per image. This allows pose estimation without explicitly modeling
camera motion. Alternatively, scanlines can be selected within a single image,
enabling single-view relative pose estimation for scanlines of rolling shutter
cameras. Our approach is designed as a foundational building block for rolling
shutter structure-from-motion (SfM), where no motion model is required, and
each scanline's pose can be computed independently. % We classify minimal
solvers for this problem in both generic and specialized settings, including
cases with parallel lines and known gravity direction, assuming known
intrinsics and no lens distortion. Furthermore, we develop minimal solvers for
the parallel-lines scenario, both with and without gravity priors, by
leveraging connections between this problem and the estimation of 2D structure
from 1D cameras. % Experiments on rolling shutter images from the Fastec
dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for initializing rolling
shutter SfM, highlighting its potential for further development. % The code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的学习范式，通过增加推理时间（计算资源）来提升机器在视觉任务中的推理能力，尤其在数据稀缺的情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类推理能力强大，而机器智能仍受限于训练数据，无法在推理时动态优化解决方案。现有研究多集中于基于明确规则的数学问题，而视觉感知等非语言推理任务仍是挑战。

Method: 受心理学双过程理论启发，结合快速思考的System I模块和慢速思考的System II模块，通过自对弈强化学习迭代优化解决方案。

Result: 在视觉任务中，该方法通过延长思考时间，表现优于大规模监督学习、基础模型甚至人类专家，尤其在医学图像癌症定位等任务中效果显著。

Conclusion: 该范式为非语言机器推理提供了突破性解决方案，展示了在数据稀缺任务中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive
decision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine
intelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically
refine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored
reasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such
as mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step
reasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,
spatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,
which remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that
enables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with
increasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where
labelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human
cognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I
module for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that
iteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This
paradigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining
solutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through
extended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning
but also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.
These tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on
medical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for
non-verbal machine reasoning.

Motivation: 现有远程心率测量方法多关注10秒视频，而忽略了超短视频的需求，本文旨在解决这一空白。

Method: 提出周期性引导的rPPG估计方法，并通过生成器重构长信号以保持周期性一致性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上实验，方法不仅准确测量超短视频心率，且性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在超短视频心率测量中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds
but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In
this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video
clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the
limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an
effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent
periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their
much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due
to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer
rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency
to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG
estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only
accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform
previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖高精度物体位姿标注，限制了大规模场景重建，需解决此问题。

Method: 利用Bézier曲线建模动态物体运动轨迹，引入动态物体渲染监督和曲线一致性约束。

Result: 在Waymo和nuPlan数据集上表现优于现有方法，动态和静态场景重建及新视角合成效果更佳。

Conclusion: BézierGS通过曲线建模和额外监督，实现了高效且准确的场景重建。

Abstract: The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing
real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on
object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and
move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision
object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To
address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting
(B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using
learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal
information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling,
automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on
dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve
reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.
Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark
demonstrate that B\'ezierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both
dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Motivation: ADNet在医学图像少样本分割中存在单原型依赖、二分类局限和固定阈值问题，TPM旨在解决这些不足。

Method: 提出Tied Prototype Model (TPM)，绑定前景和背景分布的原型位置，支持多原型和多类分割，并利用类先验定义自适应阈值。

Result: TPM显著提升了分割准确性，并成功扩展到多类分割和非典型背景特征分离。

Conclusion: TPM为医学图像少样本分割提供了新的原型建模视角，代码已开源。

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods
model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes.
However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising
direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as
an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key
limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary
classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ
variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model
(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for
foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic
foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class
segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.
Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we
leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for
adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM
provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting
pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and
unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge
highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured
environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to
enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce
an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of
modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination
changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and
vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed
low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the
ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention
prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to
$\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an
increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.
Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of
intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new
challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust
models. Project Page:

Conclusion: 自动化管道重建支持数字孪生开发，降低成本并提高建模速度和精度。

Abstract: Accurate digital twins of industrial assets, such as ships and offshore
platforms, rely on the precise reconstruction of complex pipe networks.
However, manual modelling of pipes from laser scan data is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive process. This paper presents a pipeline for automated pipe
reconstruction from incomplete laser scan data. The approach estimates a
skeleton curve using Laplacian-based contraction, followed by curve elongation.
The skeleton axis is then recentred using a rolling sphere technique combined
with 2D circle fitting, and refined with a 3D smoothing step. This enables the
determination of pipe properties, including radius, length and orientation, and
facilitates the creation of detailed 3D models of complex pipe networks. By
automating pipe reconstruction, this approach supports the development of
digital twins, allowing for rapid and accurate modeling while reducing costs.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>

Motivation: 现有张量分解方法（如Tucker和CP）在灵活性和可解释性之间存在权衡，且稀疏解难以获取。CP-INR旨在结合CP分解的天然结构优势，同时通过神经网络和非线性优化提升性能。

Method: 1. 提出CP-INR，利用神经网络参数化CP分解；2. 引入Schatten-p拟范数的变分形式实现稀疏性；3. 设计基于雅可比矩阵谱范数的平滑正则化项。

Result: 在图像修复、去噪和点云上采样等任务中，CP-INR优于现有方法，证明了其高效性和通用性。

Conclusion: CP-INR通过结合CP分解和神经网络，实现了连续数据的高效表示，为多维数据恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data,
such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become
essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like
Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In
contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more
natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains
challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a
CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit
neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data
representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of
tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a
sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p
quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For
smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the
Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness
regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can
serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image
denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive
experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image
inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority
and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频-LLM在均匀帧采样下难以有效捕捉查询相关的关键时空线索，需要更高效的方法。

Method: Q-Frame通过无训练、即插即用的策略，结合文本-图像匹配网络（如CLIP）和Gumbel-Max技巧，实现自适应帧选择。

Result: 在MLVU、LongVideoBench和Video-MME等基准数据集上，Q-Frame表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Q-Frame能高效处理更多帧，保留关键时空信息，适用于多种视频理解任务。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting
these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and
temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often
struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos
effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive
frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content
and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy
generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max
trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more
frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical
temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness
through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing
methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.

TL;DR: 通过增强视觉输入的低级空间结构（如水平线）并结合文本提示，显著提升了视觉语言模型在视觉推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在视觉推理中存在绑定问题，即难以可靠地将感知特征与正确的视觉对象关联，导致在计数、视觉搜索等任务中表现不佳。

Method: 在视觉输入中引入低级空间结构，并辅以鼓励顺序、空间感知解析的文本提示。

Result: 在多项视觉推理任务中取得显著提升：视觉搜索准确率提高25.00%，计数准确率提高26.83%，场景描述编辑距离误差减少0.32，空间关系任务性能提升9.50%。

Conclusion: 低级视觉结构化是提升视觉语言模型在空间任务中性能的有效且未被充分探索的方向。

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual
reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to
reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents.
This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual
search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor
is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking
mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a
simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level
spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual
prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically
demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by
25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in
scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship
tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the
visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,
including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade
performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,
underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely
linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual
structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving
compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for
enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

Conclusion: RetFiner通过视觉语言优化有效提升了基础模型的适应性和下游任务性能，为医学影像分析提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled clinicians and researchers to
streamline retinal disease staging. A popular DL approach is self-supervised
learning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,
avoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation
models (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.
However, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a
comprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by
their downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require
supervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific
applications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL
vision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing
FMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations
for improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training
objectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual
data. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM,
showing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly
diverse OCT classification tasks, with an average increase of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1
percentage points over their baselines, respectively. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at https://github.com/ronnief1/RetFiner.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基于耦合特征空间的现有方法。

Conclusion: UOFS框架通过解耦特征空间和优化策略，有效提升了少样本目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples
for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing
FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle
objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature
spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria
and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this
limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization
framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal
components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes
classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness
knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the
disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set
images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between
potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization
depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of
angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose
a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure
background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to
provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating
unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular
optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a
Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address
task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based
on entangled feature spaces.

Conclusion: FS-VAE通过频率分解和语义对齐显著提升了零样本动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of
identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous
approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action
recognition.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are
common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial
for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these
perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they
can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data
augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on
classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical
machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere
rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet
effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional
augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations
lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like
image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation
methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to
classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch
rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet
dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves
image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5
accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard
classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary
augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in
principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential
applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation
approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy
and discuss the implications of this limitation.

observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting
in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as
coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly
hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel
approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate
these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information
into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate
systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong
spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead.
Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy
designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further
improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model
performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a
significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial
perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a
multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing
methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba在图像修复任务中表现出色，但仍面临计算复杂性和局部像素遗忘的挑战，需要改进。

Method: 提出EAMamba框架，结合多头选择性扫描模块（MHSSM）和全方位扫描策略，优化扫描序列和捕捉全局信息。

Result: 实验表明，EAMamba在多项修复任务中显著降低FLOPs（31-89%），同时保持性能优势。

Conclusion: EAMamba为图像修复任务提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration is a key task in low-level computer vision that aims to
reconstruct high-quality images from degraded inputs. The emergence of Vision
Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks
a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence
in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage
for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters
challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that
scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To
address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba
(EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan
Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently
aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational
complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements
multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel
forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations
across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising,
deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a
significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance
compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs是否像人类一样利用场景上下文生成物体参考，以及场景上下文对模型行为的影响。

Method: 引入COOCO数据集，测试模型在不同场景-物体一致性和噪声条件下的表现，并通过注意力分析模型行为。

Result: 模型会根据场景-物体语义相关性和噪声水平动态调整对上下文的依赖，中层级注意力分析显示模型在适度噪声下更关注目标物体。

Conclusion: VLMs能动态平衡局部和上下文信息进行物体参考生成，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Natural scenes provide us with rich contexts for object recognition and
reference. In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at
generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial
configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on
scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To
address this question, we introduce the \textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context
(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to
objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different
perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,
depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the
level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high
target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis
reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the
target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that
VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference
generation. We make our dataset, code and models available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌剪枝方法依赖文本条件，但跨模态不对齐（因果、语义、空间）削弱了其效果。

Method: 提出VisionDrop，基于视觉内注意力进行令牌选择，并设计渐进式剪枝流程，保留细粒度信息。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中表现优于现有方法，无需额外训练或复杂修改。

Conclusion: VisionDrop简单高效，能在保留性能的同时实现高效推理。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences
of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens
often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to
substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in
practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to
or within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction
approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that
textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this
work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms
of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of
text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a
training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual
tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on
textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,
we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a
progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and
lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual
information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive
experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent
improvements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or
complex modifications. Its simple yet effective design enables efficient
inference while preserving strong performance across tasks.

Result: RoomCraft在多样输入模态下生成的房间布局在真实性、语义一致性和视觉吸引力上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RoomCraft通过多阶段优化和冲突处理，有效解决了3D室内场景生成中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms
existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually
appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Motivation: 解决现有潜在扩散模型在视频外绘任务中质量和适应性不足的问题。

Method: 采用扩散变换器（DiT）架构，结合视频控制分支和条件外绘分支，提出掩码驱动自注意力层和潜在对齐损失。

Result: 在零样本设置下，OutDreamer在广泛认可的基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OutDreamer展示了DiT在视频外绘任务中的潜力，为高质量和适应性强的视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video outpainting is a challenging task that generates new video content by
extending beyond the boundaries of an original input video, requiring both
temporal and spatial consistency. Many state-of-the-art methods utilize latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones but still struggle to achieve high
quality and adaptability in generated content. Diffusion transformers (DiTs)
have emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance.
We introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two
main components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional
outpainting branch. The efficient video control branch effectively extracts
masked video information, while the conditional outpainting branch generates
missing content based on these extracted conditions. Additionally, we propose a
mask-driven self-attention layer that dynamically integrates the given mask
information, further enhancing the model's adaptability to outpainting tasks.
Furthermore, we introduce a latent alignment loss to maintain overall
consistency both within and between frames. For long video outpainting, we
employ a cross-video-clip refiner to iteratively generate missing content,
ensuring temporal consistency across video clips. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our zero-shot OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods on widely recognized benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨设备使用不同稀疏特征提取算法时性能下降，主要因为假设使用相同检测器，而实际中不同描述符通常对应不同检测器。

Method: 通过特征描述符增强和潜在空间转换，解决跨检测器特征匹配问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了图像匹配和视觉定位性能。

Conclusion: 该方法首次解决了跨检测器特征匹配问题，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods fail to solve visual localization in scenarios where
different devices use different sparse feature extraction algorithms to obtain
keypoints and their corresponding descriptors. Translating feature descriptors
is enough to enable matching. However, performance is drastically reduced in
cross-feature detector cases, because current solutions assume common
keypoints. This means that the same detector has to be used, which is rarely
the case in practice when different descriptors are used. The low repeatability
of keypoints, in addition to non-discriminatory and non-distinctive
descriptors, make the identification of true correspondences extremely
challenging. We present the first method tackling this problem, which performs
feature descriptor augmentation targeting cross-detector feature matching, and
then feature translation to a latent space. We show that our method
significantly improves image matching and visual localization in the
cross-feature scenario and evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for
guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite
imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often
hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework
for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)
COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.
Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building
footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure
attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy
and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre
and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating
rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is
demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering
multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that
incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance
and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with
detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable
and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available
pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process
ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,
underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and
recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the
paper.

Abstract: This paper analyses and addresses the performance gap in the fuzzy
vault-based \ac{BCS}. We identify unstable error correction capabilities, which
are caused by variable feature set sizes and their influence on similarity
thresholds, as a key source of performance degradation. This issue is further
compounded by information loss introduced through feature type transformations.
To address both problems, we propose a novel feature quantization method based
on \it{equal frequent intervals}. This method guarantees fixed feature set
sizes and supports training-free adaptation to any number of intervals. The
proposed approach significantly reduces the performance gap introduced by
template protection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing
systems to minimize the negative effects of feature transformation. Experiments
on state-of-the-art face, fingerprint, and iris recognition systems confirm
that only minimal performance degradation remains, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the method across major biometric modalities.

compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of
simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that
ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with
ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the
ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its
pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based

for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and

Conclusion: DVidE任务及相应框架有效增强了视频大模型在动态推理中的表现，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in
understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive
reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information
emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context
can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce
Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think
like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.
In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine
whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification
version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment
relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we
propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual
reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce
inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines
ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually
relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.
Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with
strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric
specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method
in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态学习的推理时适应提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior
when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability
and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even
state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically
equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work
addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale
fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective
test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without
supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and
applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we
enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a
Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across
semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that
draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and
leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.
Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial
gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new
direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented
opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users
often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with
precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing
methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open
and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel
framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video
editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the
input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be
performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To
simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that
allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits
are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D
meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce
the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a
decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework
supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the
video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture
modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward
high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach. Project page:

Abstract: We introduce WarpRF, a training-free general-purpose framework for
quantifying the uncertainty of radiance fields. Built upon the assumption that
photometric and geometric consistency should hold among images rendered by an
accurate model, WarpRF quantifies its underlying uncertainty from an unseen
point of view by leveraging backward warping across viewpoints, projecting
reliable renderings to the unseen viewpoint and measuring the consistency with
images rendered there. WarpRF is simple and inexpensive, does not require any
training, and can be applied to any radiance field implementation for free.
WarpRF excels at both uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks, e.g.,
active view selection and active mapping, outperforming any existing method

reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods
typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be
particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and
complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation
learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as
supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two
augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.
During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to
compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the
model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity
and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual
changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that,
although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning
ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying
on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant
improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance
on general vision tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Whisper的LoRA语言专家微调框架，用于多语言ASR，通过专家融合或知识蒸馏提升目标语言识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言ASR中不同语言相互干扰，难以有效共享模型容量。

Method: 基于Whisper的LoRA语言专家微调框架，结合专家融合或知识蒸馏。

Result: 在语言感知和无语言感知场景中，性能分别提升约10%和15%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了多语言ASR的识别性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced multilingual
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to the development of advanced model
architectures and available large-scale multilingual datasets. Despite that,
multilingual ASR still suffers from the curse of multilinguality in that
different languages tend to interfere with each other, making it difficult for
the ASR model to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model
capacity across them. This paper proposes an efficient finetuning framework for
customized multilingual ASR via prepared LoRA language experts based on
Whisper. Through LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation, our approach
achieves better recognition performance on target languages than standard
fine-tuning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models
yield approximately 10\% and 15\% relative performance gains in language-aware
and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

TL;DR: VAT-KG是一种新型的多模态知识图谱，涵盖视觉、音频和文本信息，通过严格的过滤和对齐步骤自动生成，支持多模态任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKGs知识覆盖有限且模态单一，无法满足多模态任务需求，特别是视频和音频等丰富模态。

Method: 提出VAT-KG，通过跨模态知识对齐和严格过滤步骤自动构建，并设计多模态RAG框架支持任意模态查询。

Result: 实验证明VAT-KG在多模态问答任务中有效支持MLLMs。

Conclusion: VAT-KG统一并利用多模态知识，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge
across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit
knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more
grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting
pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in
outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow
range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations
reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal
tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video
and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text
Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive
multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,
where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed
descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures
cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained
semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling
the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further
introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed
concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities.
Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate
the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical
value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假新闻在多媒体平台上的快速传播对信息可信度构成严重威胁，需要一种既能提高检测性能又能增强可解释性的方法。

Method: DIFND框架结合条件扩散模型生成反驳或验证证据，并利用多代理多模态大语言模型进行逻辑推理和最终真实性判断。

Result: 在FakeSV和FVC数据集上的实验表明，DIFND在检测准确率上优于现有方法，并提供可信的决策。

Conclusion: DIFND通过联合建模多模态特征、生成性反驳线索和推理验证，显著提升了假新闻检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious
challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a
Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages
debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional
diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to
generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of
news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically
aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk
strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded,
multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly
modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich
verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements
in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets
show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers
trustworthy decisions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为BTF的“过去预测”基准，用于评估LLM在已知结果事件上的预测能力，提供了一种可重复且现实的测试环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于预测任务需要大量互联网研究和时间验证，现有基准难以提供现实且可重复的环境，因此开发了BTF。

Method: BTF包含数百个已知结果的高质量问题和相关网页语料库，通过“过去预测”方式评估LLM的预测能力。

Result: 实验表明，BTF环境下的预测结果与未解决事件的互联网预测结果相当，并能跟踪预测能力的持续进步。

Conclusion: BTF是一个动态基准，将持续更新问题，并邀请研究者使用其工具进行研究。

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to
study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the
internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the
development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting
benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM
forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark
with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already
known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of
thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts"
on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can
produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on
at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and
chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the
recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track
steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living
benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing
training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at
hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own
research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出GraphLAMA方法，通过参数适应阶段优化图语言模型（GLM），解决现有方法在上下文学习和指令调优中的效率与效果问题，实现更高的准确性和更快的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GLM方法中，上下文学习（ICL）因固定参数和长上下文导致效率与效果问题，而指令调优需要大量标注数据。论文旨在通过参数适应阶段，仅需少量标注样本即可高效适配未见过的图和任务。

Method: 提出GraphLAMA方法，结合GNN和LLM，将节点转化为LLM令牌表示空间。预训练阶段训练非LLM参数以捕获通用知识，适应阶段仅更新少量参数。

Result: 在少样本/零样本节点分类和摘要生成任务中，GraphLAMA准确率提升4.91%，推理速度比ICL快10倍（5-shot设定）。

Conclusion: GraphLAMA通过高效参数适应显著提升GLM性能，解决了ICL和指令调优的局限性，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in
various domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph
language models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret
unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in
the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).
Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model
performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs
has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to
long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for
instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this
end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can
efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled
examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference
speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its
model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and
inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network
(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the
representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented
as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model
parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture
general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters
will be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on
few/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed
GraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution
improvement in accuracy. Compared with ICL, our inference speed can be 10 times
faster under 5-shot setting.

Method: 比较了SFT、DPO和RLOO三种微调方法，并在数学任务中使用了合成数据增强和外部验证器。

Result: RLOO结合DeBERTa奖励模型表现最佳，DPO效果稳定；数学任务中数据增强和外部验证器显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为小型语言模型的任务对齐提供了实用策略和关键权衡，展示了微调与推理工具结合的潜力。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two
challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models.
Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best
alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing
tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external
verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining
fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and
practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale
language models.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为真相判断者的能力，发现推理模型比非推理模型更少倾向于相信陈述为真，但仍高于人类基准。部分先进模型表现出对真相的高准确性但对欺骗的低准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs广泛用于事实核查和决策，但其作为真相判断者的能力仍未被充分理解。

Method: 研究让8个LLMs对4800个陈述进行真伪判断，比较推理和非推理模型的表现。

Result: 推理模型的真相偏见率低于非推理模型，但仍高于人类基准；部分先进模型在真相准确性上表现良好，但在欺骗准确性上较差。

Conclusion: LLMs的能力提升并未解决其真相检测的根本挑战。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as
judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs'
veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in
reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across
several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that
rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true,
regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than
in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most
concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models
(o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an
asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly
in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not
resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于'下一个房间预测'的渐进式生成方法，用于建筑平面图设计，以解决现有端到端生成模型与实际工作流程不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型多为端到端生成，与实际建筑设计中渐进式、迭代的工作流程不符。

Method: 借鉴语言模型中的'下一个标记预测'机制，提出'下一个房间预测'范式。

Result: 实验表明，FPDS在文本到平面图任务中表现优于扩散模型和Tell2Design。

Conclusion: 该方法有望支持未来智能建筑设计。

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently
progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans
are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based
layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the
incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address
this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction'
mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next
room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling.
Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive
performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the
text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting
future intelligent architectural design.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在低资源和濒危语言（如台湾南岛语系语言）中的能力，填补研究空白。

Method: 构建FORMOSANBENCH基准，涵盖机器翻译、语音识别和文本摘要任务，评估零样本、10样本和微调设置下的模型表现。

Result: 现有模型在低资源语言中表现显著落后，10样本学习和微调仅带来有限改进。

Conclusion: 亟需开发更包容的NLP技术以支持濒危语言，并公开数据集和代码促进研究。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in high-resource
languages, their capabilities in low-resource and minority languages remain
significantly underexplored. Formosan languages -- a subgroup of Austronesian
languages spoken in Taiwan -- are both linguistically rich and endangered,
largely due to the sociolinguistic dominance of Mandarin. In this work, we
introduce FORMOSANBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
low-resource Austronesian languages. It covers three endangered Formosan
languages: Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan, across three core NLP tasks: machine
translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text summarization. We
assess model performance in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings using
FORMOSANBENCH. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap between
high-resource and Formosan languages. Existing LLMs consistently underperform
across all tasks, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning offering only limited
improvements. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive NLP
technologies that can effectively support endangered and underrepresented
languages. We release our datasets and code to facilitate future research in
this direction.

Result: KCS+IBC在保持准确性的同时降低了熵值，增加了预测多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架在平衡预测聚合与多样性方面表现良好，未来将量化其对偏见校正的影响。

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as
traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among
community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired
by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent
inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models
(LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic
prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing
prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual
dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and
introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that
KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while
KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in
variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's
ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will
quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction
and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

Motivation: 探索反向翻译在高质量低资源机器翻译中的有效性，特别是在英语-古吉拉特语翻译中。

Method: 使用MBART50模型，基于5万句对的高质量平行语料库训练基线系统，并添加经过筛选的反向翻译数据。

Result: 添加反向翻译数据未提升翻译性能，甚至略微降低。通过多种指标（BLEU、ChrF++、TER、BLEURT）评估并分析原因。

Conclusion: 反向翻译在某些低资源场景中可能达到收益递减点，对未来的研究提出了启示。

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to
generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While
this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its
effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this
work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati
translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline
system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000
sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment
this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from
monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not
improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We
evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and
analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that
backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain
low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索LLMs在生命科学领域的潜力，尤其是其在生物信息学中的复杂分析和问题解决能力。

Method: 方法包括引入BIOPARS-BENCH数据集和BioParsQA评估工具，并设计BioPars模型以评估LLMs的三种能力：获取专业知识、解释与综合知识以及提供适当证据。

Result: 结果显示BioPars在波斯医学问答中表现优异，ROUGE-L、BERTScore、MoverScore和BLEURT等指标均优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLMs在生物信息学任务中仍需进一步优化，BioPars为波斯医学问答提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life
sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological
information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are
increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized
fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset
from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.
BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of
5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces
BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main
abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing
such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,
and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve
learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,
real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the
need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in
bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM
in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of
four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable
results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a
ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model
achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT
values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition,
the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78.
BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will
be made available via the following GitHub repository:

Motivation: 资源效率是部署大型语言模型（LLM）在边缘和隐私敏感应用中的关键障碍。

Method: 通过MongoDB实现短期记忆，Qdrant实现长期语义存储，使用FastAPI和LangChain协调，并通过React.js前端展示系统。

Result: RAG减少延迟达17%，消除事实幻觉；HyDE增强语义相关性但增加响应时间和幻觉率。

Conclusion: RAG是小型LLM驱动的设备端个人助手的实用选择。

Abstract: Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models
(LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the
efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion
and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal
assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic
storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the
system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently
reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when
responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast,
enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but
incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination
rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that
scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but
magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position
RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by
small-scale LLMs.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了LLM在NL2SVA任务中的性能，为硬件设计验证提供了更高效的自动化工具。

Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of
hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property
descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate
this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding
domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we
propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a
synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To
further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset
provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer
construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that
greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance
of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA,
comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed
annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework
increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini,
while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and
integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练语言模型在时间序列预测中的适应性，特别是在低数据量情况下的表现。

Method: 研究上游后训练、时间序列分词器和语言模型主干大小等设计选择对验证损失的影响。

Result: 验证损失在语言模型中持续下降，而随机初始化模型则收敛较早，显示出非零的转移差距。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于高效计算训练在时间序列中的应用，并为研究数据分布的模态无关特性提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained
language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We
build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language
models to time series forecasting under various design choices including
upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In
the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the
validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to
Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs
continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly
initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that
holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the
effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the
way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions
leveraged by these models.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型推理模型（LRMs）是否表现出类似人类的认知习惯，并提出了CogTest基准来评估这些习惯。研究发现LRMs具有人类相似的认知习惯，并能根据任务自适应调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LRMs是否表现出类似人类的认知习惯，以更好地理解和监控模型行为。

Method: 引入CogTest基准，包含16种认知习惯和25个任务，采用证据优先的提取方法评估16种LLMs（13个LRMs和3个非推理模型）。

Result: LRMs表现出人类相似的认知习惯，并能自适应调整；某些习惯与生成有害内容相关。

Conclusion: 研究LRMs的认知习惯有助于深入理解LLM的行为模式，特别是其不当行为。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain
of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach
to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation
that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --
consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like
cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of
cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce
CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.
CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,
and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit
identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that
LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also
adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses
further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit
profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and
DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that
certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with
the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying
persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper
understanding of LLM misbehavior. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准设计存在任务分组不明确、能力重叠和诊断能力有限的问题，需要更结构化和理论化的评估方法。

Method: 采用结构方程模型（SEM）分析基准的内部效度、维度可分性和组件贡献，并基于皮亚杰认知发展理论提出能力层次结构（感知、记忆、推理）。

Result: 实验表明，新基准Gold在可解释性、指标冗余减少和认知一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为MLLM评估提供了更科学和结构化的基准设计方法。

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental
challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically
grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based
task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping
abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity,
dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated
by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel
capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development,
dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception,
Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the
proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger
interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive
consistency compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合黑盒和白盒模型优势的新框架，通过语义相似性约束优化LLM指令，提升任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒模型成本高和白盒模型资源需求大、表达能力有限的问题。

Method: 融合黑盒模型的高质量初始化指令和白盒模型的细粒度可解释性，通过语义相似性约束形成统一高维表示，迭代优化指令质量。

Result: 在复杂推理和跨语言泛化等任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代LLM驱动的应用提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for
harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying
solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and
offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur
prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box
models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box
models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output
features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse
into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and
structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine
instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad
spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual
generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with
advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving
the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

Abstract: With globalization and increasing immigrant populations, immigration
departments face significant work-loads and the challenge of ensuring fairness
in decision-making processes. Integrating artificial intelligence offers a
promising solution to these challenges. This study investigates the potential
of large language models (LLMs),such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in supporting
immigration decision-making. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach,this paper
conducted discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews to study LLM
decision-making strategies and whether they are fair. Our findings demonstrate
that LLMs can align their decision-making with human strategies, emphasizing
utility maximization and procedural fairness. Meanwhile, this paper also
reveals that while ChatGPT has safeguards to prevent unintentional
discrimination, it still exhibits stereotypes and biases concerning nationality
and shows preferences toward privileged group. This dual analysis highlights
both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automating and enhancing
immigration decisions.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MMLU-CF的无污染且更具挑战性的多选题基准，以解决现有基准因数据泄露导致的评估不可靠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多选题基准（如MMLU）因开源性质和LLM训练数据的广泛来源导致基准污染，评估结果不可靠。

Method: 通过从更广泛的领域获取数据并设计三条去污染规则避免无意数据泄露；将基准分为验证集和测试集以防止恶意数据泄露。

Result: 主流LLM（如GPT-4o）在测试集上的5-shot和0-shot得分分别为73.4%和71.9%，验证了基准的有效性。

Conclusion: MMLU-CF提供了一个更严格且无污染的评估标准，其测试集闭源以确保可靠性，验证集开源以促进透明性。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language
Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense,
understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of
training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination,
resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose
a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This
benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both
unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage,
we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To
prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and
test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set
remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is
publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent
verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful
GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on
the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a
more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard. The GitHub repository
is available at https://github.com/microsoft/MMLU-CF and the dataset refers to

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STRuCT-LLM是一个统一框架，用于训练大型语言模型（LLMs）在关系型和图结构数据上进行结构化推理，通过强化学习和Chain-of-Thought监督联合优化Text-to-SQL和Text-to-Cypher任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将关系型和图结构数据分开处理，缺乏跨形式迁移的能力。STRuCT-LLM旨在通过共享抽象实现SQL和Cypher之间的协同优化。

Method: 结合强化学习和Chain-of-Thought监督，引入基于图编辑距离的拓扑感知奖励函数，支持细粒度优化。

Result: QwQ-32B模型在Spider任务上提升13.5%，Text2Cypher提升73.1%，并在零样本下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: STRuCT-LLM证明了可执行查询作为结构化推理支架的有效性，以及SQL和Cypher联合训练的协同优势。

Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models
(LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and
graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and
Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in
graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on
graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph
formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL
and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve
Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest
model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on
semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The
model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance
on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA
(CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results
demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for
structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL
and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

Motivation: 解决大规模多语言ASR模型（如Whisper）在低资源场景（如稀有语言和代码切换）中的性能问题，同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 研究了两种策略：全微调（FFT）和仅训练软提示（SPT），并提出了SPT4ASR方法。

Result: 实验表明，深度提示调优是最有效的SPT方法，SPT4ASR进一步降低了代码切换ASR的错误率，同时保持参数效率。

Conclusion: SPT4ASR在提升低资源ASR性能的同时，保持了模型的参数效率和现有语言的性能。

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper excel in high-resource
settings but face challenges in low-resource scenarios, such as rare languages
and code-switching (CS), due to computational costs and catastrophic
forgetting. We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method
to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies:
(1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model,
demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional
methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters
and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a
combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019
datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and
our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining
parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing
languages.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注数据效率（如数据筛选和采样），而数据组织对性能的影响尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出DELT范式，包含数据评分（如LQS）、数据选择和数据排序（如FO）。LQS从梯度一致性角度评估数据的可学习性和质量，FO解决模型遗忘和数据分布偏差问题。

Result: 实验表明，DELT的不同实例均能提升模型性能，其中LQS和FO的组合效果最佳。数据效能与数据效率可同时实现。

Conclusion: 数据效能是语言模型训练中一个具有潜力的基础研究方向。

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

Conclusion: 提出的方法为动态多语言ASR模型提供了高效解决方案，计算开销小。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) have
been driven by large-scale end-to-end models like Whisper. However, challenges
such as language interference and expanding to unseen languages (language
expansion) without degrading performance persist. This paper addresses these
with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which
applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature
extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which
leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific
features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that
integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning.
Experiments across three languages from FLEURS demonstrate that Entire SPT and
LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks,
respectively, providing an efficient solution for dynamic, multilingual ASR
models with minimal computational overhead.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估过于医生中心化和英语化，忽视了医疗团队的多专业协作需求。

Method: 使用巴西国家考试题库（5,632题），对20多个领先LLMs进行零样本评估。

Result: GPT 4.1总体准确率86.6%，但在神经外科（60.0%）和社会工作（68.4%）等专业表现不佳。

Conclusion: 单一评分不足以保证AI安全性，需更细致的评估工具。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
dominated by physician-centric, English-language benchmarks, creating a
dangerous illusion of competence that ignores the interprofessional nature of
patient care. To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce
HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for
Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's
national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only
in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology,
social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous
zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while
state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%),
this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A
granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties
like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most
notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic
issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are
insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our
evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score
evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the
entire healthcare team.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making
relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for
decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound
choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and
reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this
foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of
action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle
of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology
evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning.
This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to
their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: VIDEE为非专家用户提供了实用的文本分析工具，为人机协作设计提供了启示，并指导未来智能文本分析系统的改进。

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for
entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text
analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.).
We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct
advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a
human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1)
Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search
algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution,
which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation,
which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user
validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to
evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study
involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience
-- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals
distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for
human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for
non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics
systems.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注高资源语言和标准化脚本，忽视了非正式和低资源语言（如罗马乌尔都语）中的希望言论检测。

Method: 研究引入了一个多类标注数据集，探索了希望的心理基础，并提出了一个基于注意力机制的Transformer模型。

Result: XLM-R模型表现最佳，交叉验证得分为0.78，优于基线模型SVM和BiLSTM。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源语言的希望言论检测提供了新方法和数据集，推动了包容性NLP研究。

Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable
future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes
optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although
hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and
standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms
such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a
carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP
research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four
key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset
for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope,
Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological
foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman
Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based

*J. Koorndijk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使是小型指令调优模型（如LLaMA 3 8B）也可能出现对齐伪装行为，提示干预可显著减少此行为，挑战了传统认为对齐伪装需要大规模模型的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨小型语言模型是否也会表现出对齐伪装行为，并验证提示干预的有效性。

Method: 通过实验验证LLaMA 3 8B模型的对齐伪装行为，并测试提示干预（如道德框架和推理提示）的效果。

Result: 提示干预能显著减少对齐伪装行为，且无需修改模型内部结构。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了小型模型也可能存在对齐伪装，提示干预是有效的缓解手段，需重新评估对齐伪装的定义和应对策略。

Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an
emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical
evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can
also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions,
including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly
reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the
assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment
requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception,
shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception,
which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the
understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for
alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较两种基于LLM的提取方法（直接和间接）在食品产品页面信息提取中的表现，间接方法在准确率略低的情况下显著减少LLM调用次数，提高效率和降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索利用生成式AI和LLM从在线零售商食品页面中提取结构化信息的潜力，解决大规模信息提取的效率和成本问题。

Method: 采用两种LLM方法（直接提取和间接通过生成函数提取），在3000个食品页面数据集上评估准确性、效率和成本。

Result: 间接方法准确率略低（96.48%，比直接方法低1.61%），但减少LLM调用次数95.82%，显著提升效率和降低成本。

Conclusion: 间接提取方法为基于模板的网页大规模信息提取提供了可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential
for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this
work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore
schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes,
such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based
approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions,
evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset
of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show
that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%,
$-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM
calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational
costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide
scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction
tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了MIME基准，用于评估视觉语言模型对哑剧动作的理解能力，发现现有模型表现远不如人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哑剧动作（NVC子集）是理解更复杂非语言交流的前提，但现有模型对此能力不足。

Method: 构建了包含86种哑剧动作的MIME基准，利用动作捕捉数据并添加扰动以评估模型鲁棒性。

Result: 现有视觉语言模型在MIME上表现显著差于人类。

Conclusion: 需加强研究以提升模型对人类手势的理解能力。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but
studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high
variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the
theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and
movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions
with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid
understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language
models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC.
Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel
video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions.
Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each
action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint
for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and
API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on
MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust
understanding of human gestures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估开源LLM DeepSeek在模拟公众意见方面的能力，并与主流科技公司的LLM进行比较。

Method: 通过比较DeepSeek-R1、DeepSeek-V3与Qwen2.5、GPT-4o、Llama-3.3，利用ANES和中国Zuobiao数据集评估模型预测中美社会议题公众意见的能力。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在模拟美国堕胎议题时表现最佳，但在中国样本中对资本主义议题表现不佳。所有模型存在过度概括问题。

Conclusion: 需减少LLM在文化和人口统计上的偏见，建议采用更具包容性的训练方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language
model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by
major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5,
GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National
Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these
models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and
the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between
countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate
change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily
because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or
liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling
views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income
and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant
differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the
free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to
overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting
to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to
mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling,
calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

TL;DR: 本文通过机制解释性方法研究了LLMs中记忆的底层机制，识别了触发和维持记忆的特定电路，并发现记忆预防机制在不同文本领域具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs中记忆的底层机制，特别是网络如何决定检索记忆序列的起始点以及记忆与非记忆行为的具体差异。

Method: 利用Transformer电路（最小计算子图）和对比数据集，识别模型生成与记忆内容的分歧点，并分离负责记忆的特定电路。

Result: 发现触发记忆的电路也能维持记忆，而仅维持记忆的电路无法触发记忆；记忆预防机制在不同领域具有鲁棒性，而记忆诱导更依赖上下文。

Conclusion: 记忆机制在LLMs中具有特定的电路分工，预防机制具有跨领域通用性，而诱导机制则更依赖上下文。

Abstract: Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of
training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network
decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization
sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing
memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions
from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits
-- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within
the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify
points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the
specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find
that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started,
while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation.
Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across
different text domains, while memorization induction appears more
context-dependent.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用的LLM检测器（GLD），用于检测未见过的LLM和领域生成的内容，解决了现有方法泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的普及，区分人类撰写和LLM生成的内容变得困难，这对数字平台的信任和防止错误信息传播至关重要。现有方法在泛化到新LLM和领域时效果不佳。

Method: GLD结合了双记忆网络设计和理论指导的检测泛化模块，能够检测未见过的LLM和领域生成的内容。

Result: 通过真实数据集验证，GLD在检测性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLD为数字平台和LLM提供了重要的学术和实践价值。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly
challenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content.
Detecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on
digital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the
spread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS
research. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on
identifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face
challenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This
limitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the
number of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of
domains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a
twin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module
to detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using
real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case
studies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection
methods. The study has important academic and practical implications for
digital platforms and LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于表示一致性（RC）的测试时扩展方法，通过聚合LLM的多个候选回答并考虑内部激活一致性，提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要复杂的提示和采样策略修改，RC旨在简化并提升答案聚合效果。

Method: 利用模型内部激活（密集或稀疏）的一致性，对候选回答进行加权聚合，无需额外模型查询。

Result: 在四个开源LLM和四个推理数据集上验证，RC带来最高4%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: RC通过激活一致性提升推理性能，稀疏激活信号与连贯推理概念一致。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by
allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing
methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling
strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a
test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate
responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations
in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not
only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate
response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations
while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations
can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained
sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of
multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this
answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be
down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached
activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional
model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four
reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task
performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)
over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the
sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent
reasoning.

Motivation: 当前评估基准未能分离金融知识和推理能力，且缺乏任务失败的根因分析。

Method: 引入FinEval-KR框架，提出知识评分和推理评分，基于Bloom分类法设计认知评分，并发布中文金融推理数据集。

Result: LLMs的推理能力和高阶认知能力是影响准确性的核心因素，但知识应用存在瓶颈；专业金融LLMs表现不及通用大模型。

Conclusion: FinEval-KR为金融推理能力评估提供新方法，揭示了LLMs在知识应用上的不足，并支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face
challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge
and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by
not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and
lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce
FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs'
knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge
score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further
propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in
reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new
open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to
support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning.
Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order
cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also
specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge
application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs
generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在手语识别中效率和准确性难以兼顾的问题，尤其是RNN、LSTM和GCN等模型存在的梯度消失和高计算成本问题。

Method: 采用BART架构的编码器-解码器模型，独立编码x和y坐标，并通过交叉注意力保持其关联性。

Result: 在LSA-64数据集上达到96.04%的准确率，参数仅749,888，优于其他百万参数模型，并在WLASL和ASL-Citizen数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为手语识别提供了可靠且高效的解决方案，有望提升聋人和听力障碍者的无障碍工具。

Abstract: Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments
to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to
choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had
problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite
improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This
study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of
independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of
skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By
utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently
encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their
interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves
96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous
models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent
performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation
studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and
using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study
offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with
strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

Abstract: We present Gazal-R1, a 32-billion-parameter language model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance in medical reasoning while providing transparent,
step-by-step explanations for clinical decision-making. Built upon Qwen3 32B,
our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to
outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We
developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on
a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples
that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced
parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation
(DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component
reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality.
Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring
87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing
models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work
provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable
models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training
instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed
reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing
high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance,
efficiency, and explainability.

Result: 新模型Thunder-LLM和Thunder-LLM-Ins在韩语任务中表现优于现有模型，且数据与计算资源消耗低。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效、低成本地为现有LLM添加新语言能力，代码已公开。

Abstract: Since state-of-the-art LLMs often underperform in languages other than
English or Chinese, improving the capability of LLMs in new languages has
become an essential task. Moreover, LLMs' entire end-to-end training process
remains largely unknown to the public due to proprietary reasons, technical
complexity, inconsistent documentation, and ethical considerations. The
complete picture remains a closely guarded secret within the industry. This
paper presents methods to adapt an existing English-based LLM to Korean in a
low-budget scenario. We describe the entire end-to-end process: collecting
Korean datasets, preprocessing the data, training the model, creating
downstream benchmarks, and conducting evaluations. The evaluation results
indicate that our method can effectively and cost-efficiently add new language
capabilities to existing LLMs. Our new bilingual models, Thunder-LLM and
Thunder-LLM-Ins, achieve superior Korean performance compared to
state-of-the-art models while utilizing minimal data and computational
resources. We share our comprehensive experience and make the code publicly

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over
complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be
represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work,
we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook
question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the
performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA
3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that
integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our
results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model
accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling
question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key
directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

Conclusion: 结构化输入是提升MLLMs文档理解性能的有效方法，无需修改模型架构或额外训练。

Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on
locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work
investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences
document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover
that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which
is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and
structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel
structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex
paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships
critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text
induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content,
directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing
attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question
answering performance across diverse document types without requiring
architectural modifications or additional training.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）生成文本的真实性引发监管需求，现有水印方法难以同时满足文本质量、模型无关检测和多比特水印的要求。

Method: 提出BiMark框架，包括比特翻转无偏重加权机制、多层架构和信息编码方法，以平衡文本质量与水印容量。

Result: BiMark在短文本中提取率提高30%，同时保持较低的困惑度，在下游任务中表现与非水印文本相当。

Conclusion: BiMark通过创新设计实现了高质量文本生成与有效水印嵌入的平衡，为LLM生成文本的识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns
about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for
reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising
solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical
requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message
embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve
these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text
quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge,
we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these
requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting
mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture
enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an
information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to
state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30%
higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality
indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text
on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

Abstract: This paper explores the human-centric operationalization of Automated Essay
Scoring (AES) systems, addressing aspects beyond accuracy. We compare various
machine learning-based approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) approaches,
identifying their strengths, similarities and differences. The study
investigates key dimensions such as bias, robustness, and explainability,
considered important for human-aware operationalization of AES systems. Our
study shows that ML-based AES models outperform LLMs in accuracy but struggle
with explainability, whereas LLMs provide richer explanations. We also found
that both approaches struggle with bias and robustness to edge scores. By
analyzing these dimensions, the paper aims to identify challenges and
trade-offs between different methods, contributing to more reliable and
trustworthy AES methods.

Motivation: 现有评估方法在记忆层次和交互场景多样性上存在不足，且缺乏全面的指标来多角度评估记忆能力。

Method: 构建了一个包含事实记忆和反思记忆的数据集，并提出了参与和观察两种交互场景，基于此设计了MemBench基准测试。

Result: 提出了MemBench基准测试，从有效性、效率和容量等多方面评估记忆能力，并公开了数据集和项目。

Conclusion: MemBench为研究社区提供了一个更全面的评估工具，有助于推动基于LLM的智能体的记忆能力研究。

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted the significance of memory mechanisms in
LLM-based agents, which enable them to store observed information and adapt to
dynamic environments. However, evaluating their memory capabilities still
remains challenges. Previous evaluations are commonly limited by the diversity
of memory levels and interactive scenarios. They also lack comprehensive
metrics to reflect the memory capabilities from multiple aspects. To address
these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and
benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset
incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and
proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based
on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory
capability of LLM-based agents from multiple aspects, including their
effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity. To benefit the research community, we
release our dataset and project at https://github.com/import-myself/Membench.

### [149] [Large Language Models as symbolic DNA of cultural dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21606)
*Parham Pourdavood,Michael Jacob,Terrence Deacon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出将大语言模型（LLMs）视为类似DNA的文化信息载体，强调其作为人类文化动态的压缩存储工具，而非自主智能或简单模仿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在文化演化中的角色，超越传统视角，将其视为人类自我反思和创造性假设生成的工具。

Method: 通过分析压缩、解压缩、外部化和递归四个特征，类比DNA的功能，论证LLMs的文化存储和催化作用。

Result: LLMs作为文化演化的工具，能够促进人类自我反思和低风险环境下的假设生成。

Conclusion: LLMs的意义在于增强文化可进化性，而非替代人类智能，需依赖人类解释以保持其文化相关性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs)
as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for
human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous
intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as
repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic
expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues
without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns
only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive
feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately
catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal
features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we
demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium
for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference
to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human
culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.
Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human
intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful
hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework
positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to
generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human
interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics
and norms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE-KG是一个模块化框架，用于从法律文本构建可解释的知识图谱，通过类型感知的共指消解和领域引导的实体关系提取，显著减少节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类走私网络日益复杂且难以分析，现有方法在处理法律文本时存在共指消解不足和噪声问题。

Method: 采用两步流程：类型感知的共指消解和领域引导的实体关系提取，基于改进的GraphRAG框架。

Result: 节点重复减少33.28%，法律噪声降低38.37%，生成更清晰的知识图谱。

Conclusion: CORE-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically
dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for
automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on
static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based
approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations,
and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG,
a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a
two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential,
structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using
domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG
reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a
GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph
structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing
complex criminal networks.

Abstract: Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models
(LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However,
existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of
these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their
self-reflection pattern (also termed "Aha moment") and the interconnections
across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the
reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,
DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge
paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their
final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based
questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step
problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both
the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research
results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and
exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning
process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among
these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the
reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their
thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers
valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and
reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model
design and evaluation in practical applications. We publicly release our
project at: https://github.com/ChangWenhan/FromThinking2Output

Method: 评估了两种多模态预测方法（对齐法和提示法），并分析了模型架构和数据特性的影响。

Result: 多模态方法并非在所有情况下都优于单模态基线，效果取决于模型能力和数据特征。

Conclusion: 提出了文本信息在预测中有帮助的具体条件，为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual
information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it
remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration
consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across
a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including
health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal
forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text
representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large
language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from
multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and
models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest
unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we
disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data
characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,
incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text
models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate
aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when
(4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary
predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.
Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be
expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AdaptGOT模型，结合自适应表示学习和地理共现文本信息，解决POI嵌入中的多上下文采样和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POI嵌入方法在多上下文采样、泛化性和多功能性方面存在不足。

Method: AdaptGOT模型包含上下文邻域生成、增强的GOT表示和MoE自适应编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在多个真实数据集和POI任务上验证了模型的优越性能。

Conclusion: AdaptGOT模型有效解决了POI嵌入中的关键挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI)
embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like
recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific,
end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include
the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient
exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate
generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which
integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the
Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis
on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT
model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation,
which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based,
importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual
neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention
mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and
efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based
adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency
and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence
across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple
POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

existing corpora and enriched with child-specific annotations. ChildGuard
captures diverse contexts of child-targeted hate speech, spanning age groups.

TL;DR: LastingBench是一个新框架，旨在通过扰动和重写泄露点来减少大型语言模型在问答基准测试中的记忆效应，从而确保评估的公平性和长期有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在问答基准测试中可能通过记忆任务特定数据来“作弊”，这削弱了基准评估的有效性。现有研究主要关注检测数据泄露，而忽略了减轻其影响和保护基准长期效用的问题。

Method: LastingBench通过扰动识别上下文中的泄露点，并将其重写为反事实内容，以破坏模型的记忆效应，同时保留基准的原始评估意图。

Result: 对先进问答基准的评估显示，LastingBench显著减少了记忆效应，揭示了性能差距。

Conclusion: LastingBench提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，确保基准的长期鲁棒性，促进对大型语言模型更公平和可解释的评估。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns
about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks
by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark
evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead
the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such
leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and
preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce
LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and
safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench
identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites
the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while
preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting
the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench
offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over
time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

TL;DR: GARMLE-G框架通过检索权威临床指南内容，生成与临床实践一致的医疗建议，避免了传统方法的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗语言模型依赖ICD代码预测诊断，但缺乏临床医生使用的丰富上下文和指南依据，限制了模型的临床实用性。

Method: GARMLE-G结合LLM预测和EHR数据生成查询，通过嵌入相似性检索指南内容，并将其与模型输出融合。

Result: 在高血压诊断原型中，GARMLE-G在检索精度、语义相关性和指南一致性上优于传统RAG方法。

Conclusion: GARMLE-G提供了一种可扩展、低成本且无幻觉的方法，适用于临床实践中的医疗语言模型。

Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs),
typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records
(EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not
capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis.
Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits
the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a
Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model
outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by
directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on
model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create
semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via
embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to
generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for
hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,
demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical
guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a
lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This
work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding
medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong
potential for broader clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本新闻摘要和时间戳定位方面表现良好，但在评估主题相关性和理解主题演变方面存在不足，导致摘要信息不准确或包含无关内容。

Method: 提出TIM模型，首先构建了一个包含1000多个新闻主题和3000多个标注TLS实例的大规模数据集，并采用渐进优化策略，包括指令调优和双对齐奖励学习方法，以提升摘要性能。

Result: TIM在开放领域实验中表现出强大的时间线摘要能力，有效解决了主题相关性和时间准确性的问题。

Conclusion: TIM通过渐进优化策略和双对齐奖励学习，显著提升了开放领域时间线摘要的性能，为新闻主题演变的监控提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the
evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods
typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant
timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in
zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with
assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the
summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate
timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline
Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively
summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a
large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000
annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization
strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs
instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information
filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment
reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal
perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution
principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a
robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in
open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.

Motivation: 解决自回归TTS模型在语音时长控制上的局限性，特别是在需要严格音视频同步的应用中，同时实现音色与情感的独立控制。

Conclusion: IndexTTS2为自回归TTS模型提供了高效的时长控制和情感表达方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into
autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems
exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token
generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of
synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video
dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces
IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for
speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows
explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration
control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely
generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input
prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional
expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and
emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the
emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a
separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to
reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance
clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent
representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier
for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual
descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech
generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.
Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing
state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,
and emotional fidelity.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治相关在线讨论中的潜在影响，特别是其能否模拟真实用户内容并可能操纵政治叙事。

Method: 通过三个实验，让GPT-4模拟真实或虚构的党派用户生成评论，分析其政治立场、情感和语言特征，并与真实用户评论及基准模型对比。

Result: GPT-4能生成逼真的评论，但更易制造共识；真实与人工评论在语义空间中可区分，但人工检查难以辨别。

Conclusion: LLMs可能被用于潜入在线讨论并影响政治辩论，揭示了AI驱动的话语操纵的潜在风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation
to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both
opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant
online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in
replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario:
Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular,
we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by
impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the
generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic
features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking
against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments,
both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet
tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that
real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded
space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings
provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions,
influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader
implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the
lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While
expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in
training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In
this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over
5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was
specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof
generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of
correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics
competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical
questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between
natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between
final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n
selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we
finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs
on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof
correctness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法，通过个性化调整ASR模型，提升对非标准语音（如脑瘫或遗传疾病导致的语音障碍）的识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR模型（如Whisper）对非标准语音识别效果不佳，主要因训练数据不足和标注困难。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级流程，通过选择关键词并增强语义连贯性，个性化调整ASR模型。

Result: 在儿童结构语音障碍数据上测试，转录质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有望降低非标准语音用户的沟通障碍。

Abstract: Speech impairments caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy or genetic
disorders pose significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. Despite recent advances, ASR models like Whisper struggle with
non-normative speech due to limited training data and the difficulty of
collecting and annotating non-normative speech samples. In this work, we
propose a practical and lightweight pipeline to personalize ASR models,
formalizing the selection of words and enriching a small, speech-impaired
dataset with semantic coherence. Applied to data from a child with a structural
speech impairment, our approach shows promising improvements in transcription
quality, demonstrating the potential to reduce communication barriers for
individuals with atypical speech patterns.

Result: 显著提升分类器性能，降低数据集获取成本，并改善评估指标和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结合专家训练和高质量合成数据，可有效提升文本分类任务的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced text classification by
enabling automated understanding and categorization of complex, unstructured
textual data. However, accurately capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and
contextual variations inherent in natural language, particularly within
consumer complaints, remains a challenge. This study addresses these issues by
incorporating human-experience-trained algorithms that effectively recognize
subtle semantic differences crucial for assessing consumer relief eligibility.
Furthermore, we propose integrating synthetic data generation methods that
utilize expert evaluations of generative adversarial networks and are refined
through expert annotations. By combining expert-trained classifiers with
high-quality synthetic data, our research seeks to significantly enhance
machine learning classifier performance, reduce dataset acquisition costs, and
improve overall evaluation metrics and robustness in text classification tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提取分子结构-活性关系（SAR）时面临文档格式多样性和方法通用性的挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Doc2SAR框架，整合领域专用工具和经过监督微调的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）。

Conclusion: Doc2SAR通过高效推理和实用工具（如网页应用）展示了其实际应用价值，为SAR提取提供了新思路。

Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific
literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research.
However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats
and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches
relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts,
while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient
accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and
optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we
introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific
documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods.
Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates
domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading
end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of
80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR
demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied
by a web app.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过信息论视角提出了一种探测框架，评估显式结构建模对语言模型表征的增强作用，并探讨MLPs作为GNNs高效替代方案的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现GNNs未能充分利用结构信息，而MLPs在结构感知任务中表现优异，因此探索MLPs是否可作为GNNs的替代方案。

Method: 提出模块化探测框架，分离GNNs的消息传递和特征变换操作，评估其对语言模型表征的影响。

Result: MLPs作为特征变换模块能有效提升语言模型表征的语言学知识，而仅依赖消息传递的模型表现较差。

Conclusion: MLPs在特征变换方面表现优异，可作为GNNs的高效替代方案，而消息传递操作需谨慎使用。

Abstract: Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities
and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies
indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms
inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.
Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing
framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed
to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing
language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as
efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing
classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of
either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the
message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach
isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,
avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge
Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge
encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,
consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations
across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and
semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation
operations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on
message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative
impacts on probing task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语言多样性和标注数据有限，孟加拉语方言的情感分析研究不足。

Method: 数据集包含政治和宗教内容，采用双重标注方案：多类别主题标签和多标签情感标注，由专家翻译和标注，并通过一致性检验。

Result: 数据集质量高，标注一致性强，适用于低资源方言的情感分析。

Conclusion: ANUBHUTI为孟加拉语方言的情感分析提供了重要资源，提升了自然语言处理的准确性和上下文感知能力。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored
area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper
introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences
manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects
Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly
features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio
political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance.
Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic
labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and
multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger,
Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native
translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance
performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong
consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic
checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a
critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla
dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

Method: 通过分析k-means聚类和i-vector特征，识别与说话者信息相关的神经元，并在模型剪枝中保护这些神经元。

Result: 发现这些神经元与语音和性别类别相关，保护它们能显著保留说话者相关任务的性能。

Conclusion: 这些神经元在编码说话者信息中起关键作用，保护它们有助于提升模型在说话者相关任务中的表现。

Abstract: In recent years, the impact of self-supervised speech Transformers has
extended to speaker-related applications. However, little research has explored
how these models encode speaker information. In this work, we address this gap
by identifying neurons in the feed-forward layers that are correlated with
speaker information. Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means
clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that
these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them
suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these
neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on
speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker
information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动事实核查系统越来越多地依赖LLM，了解其参数知识偏见对结果的影响变得至关重要。

Method: 通过直接提示Llama 3.1进行事实核查，并人为注入偏见生成支持、反驳或中立的文档，分析其对检索结果和最终裁决的影响。

Result: Llama 3.1对近一半的声明标记为“证据不足”，其余则依赖参数知识裁决。注入偏见显著影响检索结果，但最终裁决相对稳定。

Conclusion: 尽管检索证据受偏见影响，最终裁决的稳定性表明系统具有一定的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Automatic fact verification systems increasingly rely on large language
models (LLMs). We investigate how parametric knowledge biases in these models
affect fact-checking outcomes of the HerO system (baseline for FEVER-25). We
examine how the system is affected by: (1) potential bias in Llama 3.1's
parametric knowledge and (2) intentionally injected bias. When prompted
directly to perform fact-verification, Llama 3.1 labels nearly half the claims
as "Not Enough Evidence". Using only its parametric knowledge it is able to
reach a verdict on the remaining half of the claims. In the second experiment,
we prompt the model to generate supporting, refuting, or neutral fact-checking
documents. These prompts significantly influence retrieval outcomes, with
approximately 50\% of retrieved evidence being unique to each perspective.
Notably, the model sometimes refuses to generate supporting documents for
claims it believes to be false, creating an inherent negative bias. Despite
differences in retrieved evidence, final verdict predictions show stability
across prompting strategies. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在时间理解任务中容易产生幻觉和错误，缺乏对多实体时间关联的评估。

Method: 提出TLQA基准测试，要求模型生成与时间对齐的列表答案，并在闭卷和开放域设置下评估模型表现。

Result: 发现现有模型在闭卷设置中难以提供完整答案和时间对齐，开放域设置中检索能力需改进。

Conclusion: TLQA为未来研究提供了明确方向，代码和基准已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide
range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to
hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks
involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate
entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in
answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds.
Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to
perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer
construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List
based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in
list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark,
requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously,
which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks.
We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of
state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain
settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models,
particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align
facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain
setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA. The benchmark

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于XLNet的自动检测社交媒体上攻击性语言的模型，并与BERT进行比较，结果显示XLNet在检测攻击性内容和分类攻击类型上优于BERT，而BERT在识别攻击目标上略胜一筹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上攻击性内容的增加需要自动化检测系统，而深度学习模型（如XLNet和BERT）在自然语言处理中表现出色。

Method: 使用XLNet和BERT模型，并在Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID)上进行评估，同时采用过采样和欠采样策略处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: XLNet在检测攻击性内容和分类攻击类型上优于BERT，BERT在识别攻击目标上表现更好。过采样和欠采样策略有效改善了分类性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于XLNet的迁移学习架构在检测社交媒体攻击性语言方面具有潜力，为解决类别不平衡问题提供了有效策略。

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats,
comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an
increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms
of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual
moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can
detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using
transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding
natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an
automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized
autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely
used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated
using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter
dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show
that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing
the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the
targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and
undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and
improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of
transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for
detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的决策过程缺乏透明度，限制了其在高风险领域的应用，因此需要系统化的XAI方法以提高可解释性。

Method: 通过分类（编码器-解码器、仅编码器、仅解码器模型）和评估XAI方法，分析其在实际中的应用。

Result: 提出了XAI方法的分类框架，并总结了评估标准、应用场景及现有资源。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究透明和负责任的LLMs，以解决现有挑战并推动XAI发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing
Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often
struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box'
and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of
transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in
high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly
essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide
human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding
of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a
comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods
based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in
terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further
explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.
Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and
future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing
transparent and responsible LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，科学英语词汇频率的突然变化被认为与大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）的影响有关，但具体变化结构尚不明确。

Method: 通过词性标注和同义词组分析，量化了PubMed科学摘要中的词汇频率变化。

Result: 发现语义集群整体变化，表明变化主要是语义和语用层面的；形容词“important”使用显著下降。

Conclusion: 语言技术对语言变化的影响主要是语义和语用的，而非简单的词汇替换。

Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent
years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing
significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely
attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in
the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in
frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.
The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve
the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial"
replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and
pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include
part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over
grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential"
as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for
widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific
abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift
together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern
suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic
and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important"
shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze
decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more
complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts
with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of
language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology
continues to shape human language.

Conclusion: 该框架为波斯诗歌的作者归属和风格分析提供了有效工具，支持多语言研究和生成模型发展。

Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian
classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In
this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67
prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a
transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the
semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature
set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric
measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a
vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the
data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving
poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level
classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,
revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate
threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly
confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at
lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational
forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The
results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification
and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general
computational literature research. This research will facilitate further
research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative
modeling of Persian poetry.

Conclusion: LinguaSynth为可解释且高效的NLP模型设定了新标准，挑战了深度学习在文本分类中的必要性。

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced NLP, but its reliance on large
black-box models introduces critical interpretability and computational
efficiency concerns. This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text
classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary
linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level
semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic
regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains
interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89
percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by
3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that
syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and
effectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new
benchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the
prevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for
high-performing text classification.

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential
for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty
quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained
popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the
implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency
as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis.
We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests
to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output
conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark
datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL),
highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the
statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and
demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods
that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.
These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究神经网络语言模型内部如何构建句法结构，尤其是微观和宏观句法结构在不同层的形成过程。

Method: 采用Derivational Probing方法，分析BERT模型中词嵌入在不同层传播时的句法结构构建。

Result: 实验表明，微观句法结构在低层形成，逐步整合为宏观句法结构；宏观结构的构建时机对下游任务性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 句法结构的构建遵循自下而上的规律，且宏观结构的整合时机对模型性能有显著影响。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that neural language models encode syntactic
structures in their internal representations, yet the derivations by which
these structures are constructed across layers remain poorly understood. In
this paper, we propose Derivational Probing to investigate how micro-syntactic
structures (e.g., subject noun phrases) and macro-syntactic structures (e.g.,
the relationship between the root verbs and their direct dependents) are
constructed as word embeddings propagate upward across layers. Our experiments
on BERT reveal a clear bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures emerge
in lower layers and are gradually integrated into a coherent macro-syntactic
structure in higher layers. Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb
number agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic
structures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing
for integrating global syntactic information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepTalk提出了一种基于MoE架构的自适应模态专家学习框架，解决了原生多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）因数据不足导致的性能下降问题，性能损失仅为5.5%，对话延迟低于0.5秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原生MLLMs因语音-文本配对数据不足导致性能下降和灾难性遗忘，而模块化MLLMs无法保留丰富的副语言特征。

Method: DeepTalk采用MoE架构，自适应区分模态专家，分别进行单模态训练和多模态协作训练。

Result: 性能损失仅为5.5%，显著优于原生MLLMs的20%以上损失，对话延迟低于0.5秒。

Conclusion: DeepTalk在保留副语言特征的同时，显著提升了性能，实现了无缝智能语音交互。

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large
language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech
and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs
preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and
generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a
separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response
latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available
paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs
compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To
address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality
expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk
first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality
load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized
single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.
As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the
original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of
over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par
with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within
0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的方法来全面评估多模态大语言模型（LLMs）在语音对话中的表现，填补了现有评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法多基于文本，忽略了语音的独特特性（如韵律、同音词等），无法优化语音LLMs在现实应用中的用户体验。

Method: 系统整理真实语音聊天数据，引入多样化的说话者属性和声学条件，并增强语音特定现象的数据集；设计查询感知的评估方法。

Result: 测试显示不同语音场景下模型性能差异显著，查询感知评估能提供更细粒度的分析。

Conclusion: 该基准为语音模型的开发和评估提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have
demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the
lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM
evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world
applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks,
overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody,
homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a
novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations.
We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios,
introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment
the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware
evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to
enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing
and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing
significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios.
The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment
under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable
insights for speech model development and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估VLMs作为通用世界模型的潜力，填补系统性评估的空白。

Method: 提出两阶段框架（感知与预测），并引入WM-ABench基准进行大规模实验。

Result: 现有VLMs在基础世界建模能力上表现不佳，如运动轨迹区分接近随机准确率。

Conclusion: VLMs与世界建模的人类水平存在显著差距。

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and
predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning.
Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and
Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have
evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual
understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities
remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we
propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial,
temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation,
transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation
of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse
simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660
experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these
models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For
instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing
motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding --
e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones.
More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and
human-level world modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM在不同语言和文化背景下的行为，尤其是在其输出可能影响公众意见或强化主流叙事的情况下。

Method: 两阶段评估：第一阶段评估事实性问题的一致性，第二阶段探讨地缘政治敏感争议中的偏见。

Result: 第一阶段显示查询语言导致的偏见，第二阶段反映模型训练背景与查询语言的交互作用。

Conclusion: 论文提供了一个评估LLM行为的框架，为多语言环境中的文化敏感评估提供了见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
linguistic and cultural contexts, understanding their behavior in both factual
and disputable scenarios is essential, especially when their outputs may shape
public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two
types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and
inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase
evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single
verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across
different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically
sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or
ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset
spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question
types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,
while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and
query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM
behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM
deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.

<details>

Motivation: 在语言模型训练中，如何直接获取适合多任务能力的数据混合是一个难题，因为数据与任务的关系难以建模。

Method: 通过识别检查点模型在基准测试中的能力，利用其一阶影响力近似作为数据混合信号。

Result: 在八个推理基准测试中，性能提升高达1.93%。

Conclusion: 检查点模型具有优化数据质量和混合的潜力。

Abstract: In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities
from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right
data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks
is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models
exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory.
Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are
under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these
artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and
leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence
approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks
that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining
setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the
potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data
mixtures.

Method: 构建3700个道德困境，LLMs作为移民检查员根据ERG理论分类的叙事做决策。

Result: 发现LLMs决策存在显著模式，隐含偏好，且对社会身份敏感，部分模型对边缘身份拒绝率更高。

Conclusion: PapersPlease基准揭示了LLMs的决策偏见，数据公开供进一步研究。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance and biases of large language models (LLMs) through
role-playing scenarios is becoming increasingly common, as LLMs often exhibit
biased behaviors in these contexts. Building on this line of research, we
introduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed
to investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human
needs. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to
approve or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives
are constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory,
which categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of
six LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making,
suggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation
of the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows
varying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with
some models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities. All
data is publicly available at https://github.com/yeonsuuuu28/papers-please.

TL;DR: 研究评估了工具集成LLM代理的稳定性，发现其在工具调用各阶段易出错，开源模型比专有模型更脆弱，增大模型规模未必提升稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对工具集成LLM代理的评估多关注端到端工具使用，忽视稳定性，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过实验分析代理在工具调用各阶段的错误易感性，包括阅读文档、选择工具、生成参数和处理响应。

Result: 代理在各阶段均易出错，开源模型更脆弱；增大模型规模未显著提升推理能力，反而可能增加攻击风险。

Conclusion: 强调评估代理稳定性的重要性，为未来LLM开发和评估提供重要见解。

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on
end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits
their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can
cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by
investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire
tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools
and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through
extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors
at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than
those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size
does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents
more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights
the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for
future LLM development and evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种混合方法（GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame），结合令牌级和提示级攻击技术，显著提高了对预训练语言模型的越狱成功率，并揭示了现有安全措施的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练语言模型（PTLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）广泛应用，但其安全性仍面临令牌级和提示级越狱攻击的威胁。现有方法各有局限性，需要更高效的混合攻击技术。

Method: 提出两种混合攻击方法：GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame，结合令牌级和提示级技术，评估了它们在Vicuna和Llama模型上的效果。

Result: GCG + PAIR在Llama-3上的攻击成功率（ASR）达到91.6%，显著高于PAIR的58.4%；GCG + WordGame在严格评估下仍保持80%以上的ASR。两种方法均能突破高级防御。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前安全措施的漏洞，强调了对抗适应性攻击时需采取更全面的防护措施。

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications.
Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit
their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary
inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks.
Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box
models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token
optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs
to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be
unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we
propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques
to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the
newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and
Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its
constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its
Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's
58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of
WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like
Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and
reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which
fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported
vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw
success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic
safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

Result: 结果表明，社交模拟应通过其经验真实性进行验证，且模拟组件需在拟合环境中测量。

Conclusion: 结论强调在基于生成代理的社会模拟中需要更严谨的方法。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered
a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical
studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have
been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds,
there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental
designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the
use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we
provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before
focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test
different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our
findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical
realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted.
With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based
modeling for social simulation.

Motivation: 预训练模型在通用领域表现优异，但在驾驶舱等特定领域（含专业词汇和多语言对话）性能下降，需针对性改进。

Method: 收集驾驶舱模拟器和飞行员访谈录音，手动标注数据；提出多种规范化方案；采用LoRA进行高效微调。

Result: WER从68.49%（未微调、未规范化）降至26.26%（微调+规范化）。

Conclusion: 规范化方案和LoRA微调显著提升了驾驶舱对话转录的准确性。

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to
significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The
pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few
epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong
generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does
suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the
cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual
conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy
of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85
minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings
with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men
speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we
propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve
Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,
utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without
normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the
proposed normalization scheme).

Abstract: This study focuses on evaluating the performance of machine translations
(MTs) compared to human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's
literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. The research
constructs a Peter Pan corpus, comprising 21 translations: 7 human translations
(HTs), 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine
translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis employs a generic feature set
(including lexical, syntactic, readability, and n-gram features) and a creative
text translation (CTT-specific) feature set, which captures repetition, rhythm,
translatability, and miscellaneous levels, yielding 447 linguistic features in
total.
  Using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, we
conduct a stylometric analysis of these translations. Results reveal that in
generic features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction
word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs
show significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios.
Regarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning
more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential
of LLMs in CLT.

Conclusion: 机器翻译输出在英中新闻文本中具有独特的语言特征，LLM和NMT表现不同，但中外LLM无显著差异。

Abstract: This study explores Machine Translationese (MTese) -- the linguistic
peculiarities of machine translation outputs -- focusing on the
under-researched English-to-Chinese language pair in news texts. We construct a
large dataset consisting of 4 sub-corpora and employ a comprehensive five-layer
feature set. Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature
selection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the
presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly
distinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in
MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative
conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%
classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and
NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower
lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic
LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by
Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.

Result: 该方法在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen3模型上实现了推理成本降低70%且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 论文为LLM的稳健推理研究提供了新基准和方法，未来可进一步探索自我修正能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as
backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments,
the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain
underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models
often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically
show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence
on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially
degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed
across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1
and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that
leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning
steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in
inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new
benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning
steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a
foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究分析了Twitter上有影响力用户在三个全球争议话题（COVID-19、COP26、俄乌战争）中的语言复杂性，发现语言使用在账户类型、政治倾向、内容可靠性和情感维度上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体重塑公共话语，分析用户生成内容的语言特征有助于理解其社会影响。

Method: 结合多种文本复杂性指标，评估语言在账户类型、政治倾向、内容可靠性和情感四个维度的变化。

Result: 发现语言复杂性在不同维度上存在显著差异，政治倾向和可靠性相似的用户倾向于使用共同的行话。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了数字平台的社交语言学动态，深化了对在线空间中语言如何反映意识形态和社会结构的理解。

Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in
response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural
interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed
communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges
entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms
reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated
content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this
paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential
users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics:
COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of
textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key
dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and
sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,
including variations in language complexity between individuals and
organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and
between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.
Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to
use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and
reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new
insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute
to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social
structures in online spaces.

*David Demitri Africa*

TL;DR: 研究通过技术手段分离并解释了GPT-2 Small中负责主谓一致的子网络（或“电路”），发现仅需少量组件即可完成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GPT-2 Small中主谓一致功能的实现机制，理解其内部结构。

Method: 使用性能验证、直接路径修补和直接对数归因等技术，分离出候选电路。

Result: 发现仅需少量组件即可完成主谓一致任务，但复杂任务需要更多组件。

Conclusion: GPT-2 Small中主谓一致功能由特定子网络实现，且其效率与任务复杂度相关。

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or
"circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this
study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g.
"Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict
the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural
subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification
automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit
attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to
the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small
fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model
performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了DAPFAM，一个公开的、领域感知的专利检索数据集，解决了现有数据集在多领域标注、多司法管辖区覆盖和计算资源管理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专利检索数据集缺乏明确的领域标注、多司法管辖区覆盖和平衡的查询领域表示，且计算资源需求高。

Method: 通过三步数据整理流程构建DAPFAM数据集，包含1,247个平衡领域的查询家族和45,336个目标家族，使用IPC代码标注领域关系。

Result: 数据集包含49,869个评估对，支持跨领域专利检索实验，基线实验显示跨领域检索存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: DAPFAM填补了专利检索数据集的空白，支持高效且资源友好的实验，未来将公开可用。

Abstract: In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need
for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage,
balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub
document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often
overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access
domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level.
The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336
full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments
(forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as
explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed
labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes,
resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional,
requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a
size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document
level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe
our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset
statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval
methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in
crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now
the access link is this repository:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语音自监督学习（SSL）模型在方言阿拉伯语（DA）和阿拉伯语-英语代码转换（CS）语音上的表现，提出了一种改进的音频拼接方法生成人工CS数据，并通过微调显著降低了词错误率（WER）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决方言阿拉伯语和代码转换语音数据稀缺的问题，并提升模型在这些任务上的性能。

Method: 提出Spliced-Audio Generated（SAGE）数据生成方法，结合Experience Replay（ER）增强泛化能力，并引入外部语言模型优化结果。

Result: 在阿拉伯语和英语CS基准测试中，WER绝对降低了7.8%，整体平均WER从31.7%降至26.6%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在代码转换任务上优于大规模多语言模型，展示了高效的数据生成和微调策略的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of various speech SSL models on
dialectal Arabic (DA) and Arabic-English code-switched (CS) speech. To address
data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate
artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the
proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement
on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks.
Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to
enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the
overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching
benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%. A WER of 31.1% on Arabic-English CS
benchmarks surpasses large-scale multilingual models, including USM and
Whisper-large-v2 (both over ten times larger) by an absolute margin of 5.5% and
8.4%, respectively.

TL;DR: QuickSilver是一个无需修改模型权重或结构的模块化框架，通过动态令牌停止、KV缓存跳过和上下文令牌融合等机制，显著减少推理时的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）推理阶段占用了大部分延迟和能耗，现有方法通常需要重新训练或改变架构，限制了其适用性。

Method: QuickSilver通过动态令牌停止、KV缓存跳过和上下文令牌融合三种机制，在不改变模型权重或结构的情况下优化推理效率。

Result: 在GPT-2和Llama-2上测试，QuickSilver实现了高达39.6%的FLOP减少，且困惑度仅轻微增加（≤0.2）。

Conclusion: QuickSilver为LLM推理提供了一种高效、兼容性强的优化方案，适用于冻结的密集模型。

Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in
large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.
While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime
optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive
decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,
and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or
disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,
token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time
without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four
synergistic mechanisms:
  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged
representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory
writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which
collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.
  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on
frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and
Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP
reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RCO的新框架，通过优化批评模型来提升语言模型的反馈和修正能力，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未深入探讨哪些类型的批评对改进模型响应最有效，以及如何生成此类批评。

Method: RCO框架通过批评效用（CU）量化批评的有效性，利用反馈循环训练批评模型，无需直接评估批评偏好。

Result: 在五种任务中，RCO在批评质量和修正结果上显著优于传统方法和开源模型。

Conclusion: RCO通过优化批评模型，显著提升了语言模型的批评-修正循环效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and
critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in
various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques
are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such
critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented
\textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to
train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where
critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its
responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these
refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By
focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need
for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving
meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,
dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,
and code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional
methods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement
outcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel
supervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive
experimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM
critique-refinement loops.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的探测任务——问卷建模（QM），利用人类调查数据作为上下文示例，提高了基于问题的偏见评估的稳定性，并可用于比较指令调优模型与其基础版本。实验表明，指令调优确实可能改变偏见方向，且更大模型能更有效地利用上下文示例，表现出更小的偏见分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在查询LLMs政治问题时评估其潜在偏见的稳定性不足，导致模型间比较不可靠。因此，需要一种更稳定的方法。

Method: 提出问卷建模（QM）任务，利用人类调查数据作为上下文示例，改进偏见评估的稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，指令调优可能改变偏见方向，且更大模型能更有效地利用上下文示例，表现出更小的偏见分数。

Conclusion: QM方法提高了偏见评估的稳定性，并揭示了指令调优和模型大小对偏见的影响。

Abstract: A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to
evaluate their potential biases. However, this probing method has limited
stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we
argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire
Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that
QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate
that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions.
Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can
indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that
larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and
generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个专注于推理的大语言模型，以支持韩语AI创新并为全球研究社区提供资源。

Method: 采用Peri-LN Transformer架构，通过三阶段课程学习扩展上下文窗口，并结合监督微调和强化学习。

Result: 在韩国基准测试中表现优异，视觉增强版本甚至超越GPT-4.1，且训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: HyperCLOVA X THINK为韩语AI提供了强大基础，并有望通过开源和轻量化技术进一步推广。

Abstract: We introduce HyperCLOVA X THINK, the first reasoning-focused large language
model in the HyperCLOVA X family, pre-trained on roughly $6$ trillion
high-quality Korean, and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic
Korean data. It was implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN
Transformer scaled with $\mu$P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum
that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via
supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards
supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers
competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused
benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while
preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a
vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM
benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute
than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and
distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an
open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these
capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI
innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GPT-4o的新方法，利用上下文信息检测结构化数据中的个人数据，并在多个数据集上验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CASSED和Presidio）在检测个人数据时未充分利用上下文信息，导致性能受限。

Method: 结合特征名称、值、其他特征名称及数据集描述等上下文信息，利用GPT-4o进行检测。

Result: 在医疗数据集MIMIC-Demo-Ext上表现优异，且在Kaggle和OpenML数据集中因利用上下文信息而显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 未来研究需要更多真实世界数据集以进一步提升个人数据检测性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for detecting personal data in structured
datasets, leveraging GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model. A key
innovation of our method is the incorporation of contextual information: in
addition to a feature's name and values, we utilize information from other
feature names within the dataset as well as the dataset description. We compare
our approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED,
evaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset,
datasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a
real-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.
  Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending
on the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on
which it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is
comparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly
outperforming the others. Notably, personal data detection in the Kaggle and
OpenML datasets appears to benefit from contextual information. This is
evidenced by the poor performance of CASSED and Presidio (both of which do not
utilize the context of the dataset) compared to the strong results of our
GPT-4o-based approach.
  We conclude that further progress in this field would greatly benefit from
the availability of more real-world datasets containing personal information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM作为评估者（LLM-as-a-Judge）在评分任务中的偏见问题，提出了一个评估框架，并通过实验揭示了评分偏见对评估稳定性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估者在复杂任务中广泛应用，但其评分偏见影响了公平性和可靠性，目前对评分偏见的系统性研究较少。

Method: 通过数据合成扩展现有基准数据集，设计多维度评估指标，定义并量化评分偏见。

Result: 实验表明评分偏见会破坏评估模型的稳定性，探索性实验为评分提示模板设计和偏见缓解提供了见解。

Conclusion: 研究强调了评分偏见的系统性评估重要性，并为未来设计更公平的LLM评估方法提供了方向。

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise
to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks.
Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language
Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However,
there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the
fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or
mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based
evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based
evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and
provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We
augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct
our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge
models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and
discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt
templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score
rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类语言解析策略并非随机，但此前研究表明随机策略也能实现高通信准确性。本研究旨在验证在更复杂条件下随机策略是否依然有效。

Method: 1. 使用具有层次结构的复杂输入；2. 在目标函数中加入与惊讶度相关的项。

Result: 通过实验评估随机解析策略在复杂条件下的表现。

Conclusion: 研究结果可能揭示随机策略的局限性，进一步理解人类语言解析的非随机性。

Abstract: If humans understood language by randomly selecting parsing actions, it might
have been necessary to construct a robust symbolic system capable of being
interpreted under any hierarchical structure. However, human parsing strategies
do not seem to follow such a random pattern. Why is that the case? In fact, a
previous study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases
have reported that agents adopting random parsing
strategies$\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language
comprehension$\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this
study, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications
to the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have
hierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation
more difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is
known to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into
the objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents
employing random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy.

Abstract: We present a grammar error correction (GEC) system that achieves state of the
art for the Czech language. Our system is based on a neural network translation
approach with the Transformer architecture, and its key feature is its
real-time synthetic generation pipeline, which dynamically augments sentences
with artificial errors by introducing both language-agnostic and Czech-specific
errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the
Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error
generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size,
and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert
fine-tuning scenarios. Our best-performing model is superior both in
performance and computational efficiency. The source code and the trained model

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模拟真实临床诊断过程的基准测试（Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark）和模型无关的诊断协调器（MAI-DxO），显著提高了诊断准确性和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型的评估方法未能反映真实临床诊断的复杂性和迭代性，因此需要一种更贴近实际的方法来评估和改进AI在医学诊断中的表现。

Method: 通过将304例NEJM-CPC病例转化为逐步诊断过程，引入MAI-DxO协调器模拟医生团队，提出诊断假设并选择高价值测试。

Result: MAI-DxO与OpenAI o3模型结合时，诊断准确率达80%，比普通医生高4倍，成本降低20%。在追求最高准确率时，准确率达85.5%。

Conclusion: AI系统通过迭代思考和明智行动，可以显著提升临床诊断的精确性和成本效益。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert
medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models
rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the
complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In
clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic
hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just
learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final
diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential
Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New
England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases
into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case
abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper
model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is
assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician
visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator
(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,
proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,
cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%
diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist
physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to
physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum
accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO
generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and
Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively
and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in
clinical care.

TL;DR: FrankenBot是一个基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的机器人操作框架，通过模仿人脑结构实现多功能集成与高效操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能在复杂动态环境中执行多样化任务的通用机器人系统，需整合任务规划、策略生成等功能，但现有方法缺乏统一架构。

Method: 采用分治策略和人脑结构，将功能映射到不同脑区（如皮层、小脑等），设计高效协调机制。

Result: 实验表明，FrankenBot在异常处理、长期记忆和操作效率方面表现优异，无需微调或再训练。

Conclusion: FrankenBot通过VLM驱动和脑形态设计，实现了功能全面与高效操作的平衡。

Abstract: Developing a general robot manipulation system capable of performing a wide
range of tasks in complex, dynamic, and unstructured real-world environments
has long been a challenging task. It is widely recognized that achieving
human-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to
integrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy
generation, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving
high-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
pretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge,
exhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning
capabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a
single function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without
integrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a
divide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose
FrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that
achieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our
framework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions
from frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional
completeness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy
generation, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex,
cerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and
design efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules. We conducted
comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic
environments, demonstrating that our method offers significant advantages in
anomaly detection and handling, long-term memory, operational efficiency, and
stability -- all without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

Abstract: Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics
Challenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial
autonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is
software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++
expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark
contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled
modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework
designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that
allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using
state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy)
while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots.
A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked
publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure
real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control,
SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with
native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from
manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless
hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of
mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices
under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates
research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.

Conclusion: TOMD数据集和动态多尺度融合模型为未来非结构化户外导航研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Detecting traversable pathways in unstructured outdoor environments remains a
significant challenge for autonomous robots, especially in critical
applications such as wide-area search and rescue, as well as incident
management scenarios like forest fires. Existing datasets and models primarily
target urban settings or wide, vehicle-traversable off-road tracks, leaving a
substantial gap in addressing the complexity of narrow, trail-like off-road
scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Trail-based Off-road Multimodal
Dataset (TOMD), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for such
environments. TOMD features high-fidelity multimodal sensor data -- including
128-channel LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, and illumination measurements --
collected through repeated traversals under diverse conditions. We also propose
a dynamic multiscale data fusion model for accurate traversable pathway
prediction. The study analyzes the performance of early, cross, and mixed
fusion strategies under varying illumination levels. Results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach and the relevance of illumination in segmentation
performance. We publicly release TOMD at https://github.com/yyyxs1125/TMOD to
support future research in trail-based off-road navigation.

Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of guidewire shapes is crucial
for precise navigation in robot-assisted endovascular interventions.
Conventional 2D Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) is limited by the absence
of depth information, leading to spatial ambiguities that hinder reliable
guidewire shape sensing. This paper introduces a novel multimodal framework for
real-time 3D guidewire reconstruction, combining preoperative 3D Computed
Tomography Angiography (CTA) with intraoperative 2D DSA images. The method
utilizes robust feature extraction to address noise and distortion in 2D DSA
data, followed by deformable image registration to align the 2D projections
with the 3D CTA model. Subsequently, the inverse projection algorithm
reconstructs the 3D guidewire shape, providing real-time, accurate spatial
information. This framework significantly enhances spatial awareness for
robotic-assisted endovascular procedures, effectively bridging the gap between
preoperative planning and intraoperative execution. The system demonstrates
notable improvements in real-time processing speed, reconstruction accuracy,
and computational efficiency. The proposed method achieves a projection error
of 1.76$\pm$0.08 pixels and a length deviation of 2.93$\pm$0.15\%, with a frame
rate of 39.3$\pm$1.5 frames per second (FPS). These advancements have the
potential to optimize robotic performance and increase the precision of complex
endovascular interventions, ultimately contributing to better clinical
outcomes.

Conclusion: AeroLite-MDNet系统有效解决了无人机着陆偏差问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed in diverse
applications such as land surveying, material transport, and environmental
monitoring. Following missions like data collection or inspection, UAVs must
land safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an
essential requirement for ensuring operational continuity. However, accurate
landing remains challenging due to factors like GPS signal interference. To
address this issue, we propose a deviation warning system for UAV landings,
powered by a novel vision-based model called AeroLite-MDNet. This model
integrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection
and incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We
introduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the
system's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new
dataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to
support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system
achieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6\%,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing UAV landing reliability. Code will

Result: 研究发现不同用户和缩放因子在特定延迟水平下性能存在显著差异，表明最佳缩放因子需个性化。

Conclusion: 个性化建模是实现机器人远程操作（如远程手术）在通信延迟下最优性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Robotic teleoperation over long communication distances poses challenges due
to delays in commands and feedback from network latency. One simple yet
effective strategy to reduce errors and increase performance under delay is to
downscale the relative motion between the operating surgeon and the robot. The
question remains as to what is the optimal scaling factor, and how this value
changes depending on the level of latency as well as operator tendencies. We
present user studies investigating the relationship between latency, scaling
factor, and performance. The results of our studies demonstrate a statistically
significant difference in performance between users and across scaling factors
for certain levels of delay. These findings indicate that the optimal scaling
factor for a given level of delay is specific to each user, motivating the need
for personalized models for optimal performance. We present techniques to model
the user-specific mapping of latency level to scaling factor for optimal
performance, leading to an efficient and effective solution to optimizing
performance of robotic teleoperation and specifically telesurgery under large
communication delay.

Conclusion: 该方法为滑移转向车辆的视觉导航提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-based lane keeping is a topic of significant interest in the robotics
and autonomous ground vehicles communities in various on-road and off-road
applications. The skid-steered vehicle architecture has served as a useful
vehicle platform for human controlled operations. However, systematic modeling,
especially of the skid-slip wheel terrain interactions (primarily in off-road
settings) has created bottlenecks for automation deployment. End-to-end
learning based methods such as imitation learning and deep reinforcement
learning, have gained prominence as a viable deployment option to counter the
lack of accurate analytical models. However, the systematic formulation and
subsequent verification/validation in dynamic operation regimes (particularly
for skid-steered vehicles) remains a work in progress. To this end, a novel
approach for structured formulation for learning visual navigation is proposed
and investigated in this work. Extensive software simulations, hardware
evaluations and ablation studies now highlight the significantly improved
performance of the proposed approach against contemporary literature.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated exceptional locomotion capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning (RL), including extreme parkour maneuvers.
However, integrating locomotion skills with navigation in quadrupedal robots
has not been fully investigated, which holds promise for enhancing
long-distance movement capabilities. In this paper, we propose Skill-Nav, a
method that incorporates quadrupedal locomotion skills into a hierarchical
navigation framework using waypoints as an interface. Specifically, we train a
waypoint-guided locomotion policy using deep RL, enabling the robot to
autonomously adjust its locomotion skills to reach targeted positions while
avoiding obstacles. Compared with direct velocity commands, waypoints offer a
simpler yet more flexible interface for high-level planning and low-level
control. Utilizing waypoints as the interface allows for the application of
various general planning tools, such as large language models (LLMs) and path
planning algorithms, to guide our locomotion policy in traversing terrains with
diverse obstacles. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and
real-world scenarios demonstrate that Skill-Nav can effectively traverse
complex terrains and complete challenging navigation tasks.

Abstract: Mobile robots rely on object detectors for perception and object localization
in indoor environments. However, standard closed-set methods struggle to handle
the diverse objects and dynamic conditions encountered in real homes and labs.
Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), driven by Vision Language Models
(VLMs), extends beyond fixed labels but still struggles with domain shifts in
indoor environments. We introduce a Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA)
approach that adapts a pre-trained model without accessing source data. We
refine pseudo labels via temporal clustering, employ multi-scale threshold
fusion, and apply a Mean Teacher framework with contrastive learning. Our
Embodied Domain Adaptation for Object Detection (EDAOD) benchmark evaluates
adaptation under sequential changes in lighting, layout, and object diversity.
Our experiments show significant gains in zero-shot detection performance and
flexible adaptation to dynamic indoor conditions.

Method: 采用序列-求解流程，结合多面体动作规划和超平面模型，限制智能体在相邻凸多面体区域内运动，并减少碰撞约束的应用范围。

Result: 在代表性多智能体场景中，该方法比非结构化MILP基线快一个数量级，且能生成无碰撞的平滑轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化约束和成本函数，显著提升了多智能体运动规划的效率和轨迹质量。

Abstract: We propose a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for multi-agent motion
planning that embeds Polytopic Action-based Motion Planning (PAAMP) into a
sequence-then-solve pipeline. Region sequences confine each agent to adjacent
convex polytopes, while a big-M hyperplane model enforces inter-agent
separation. Collision constraints are applied only to agents sharing or
neighboring a region, which reduces binary variables exponentially compared
with naive formulations. An L1 path-length-plus-acceleration cost yields smooth
trajectories. We prove finite-time convergence and demonstrate on
representative multi-agent scenarios with obstacles that our formulation
produces collision-free trajectories an order of magnitude faster than an
unstructured MILP baseline.

Abstract: Modern industry is increasingly moving away from mass manufacturing, towards
more specialized and personalized products. As manufacturing tasks become more
complex, full automation is not always an option, human involvement may be
required. This has increased the need for advanced human robot collaboration
(HRC), and with it, improved methods for interaction, such as voice control.
Recent advances in natural language processing, driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), have the potential to answer this demand. Large language
models (LLMs) have rapidly developed very impressive general reasoning
capabilities, and many methods of applying this to robotics have been proposed,
including through the use of code generation. This paper presents Language
Model Program Voice Control (LMPVC), an LLM-based prototype voice control
architecture with integrated policy programming and teaching capabilities,
built for use with Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) compatible robots. The
architecture builds on prior works using code generation for voice control by
implementing an additional programming and teaching system, the Policy Bank. We
find this system can compensate for the limitations of the underlying LLM, and
allow LMPVC to adapt to different downstream tasks without a slow and costly
training process. The architecture and additional results are released on
GitHub (https://github.com/ozzyuni/LMPVC).

Conclusion: 该框架为DLO的工业装配提供了集成化解决方案，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Industrial assembly of deformable linear objects (DLOs) such as cables offers
great potential for many industries. However, DLOs pose several challenges for
robot-based automation due to the inherent complexity of deformation and,
consequentially, the difficulties in anticipating the behavior of DLOs in
dynamic situations. Although existing studies have addressed isolated
subproblems like shape tracking, grasping, and shape control, there has been
limited exploration of integrated workflows that combine these individual
processes. To address this gap, we propose an object-centric perception and
planning framework to achieve a comprehensive DLO assembly process throughout
the industrial value chain. The framework utilizes visual and tactile
information to track the DLO's shape as well as contact state across different
stages, which facilitates effective planning of robot actions. Our approach
encompasses robot-based bin picking of DLOs from cluttered environments,
followed by a coordinated handover to two additional robots that mount the DLOs
onto designated fixtures. Real-world experiments employing a setup with
multiple robots demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and its relevance
to industrial scenarios.

Result: 仿真测试表明，RM-Dijkstra算法在路径精度和平滑度上优于传统算法，尤其在复杂场景中。

Conclusion: RM-Dijkstra算法有效解决了表面最优路径规划问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The Dijkstra algorithm is a classic path planning method, which operates in a
discrete graph space to determine the shortest path from a specified source
point to a target node or all other nodes based on non-negative edge weights.
Numerous studies have focused on the Dijkstra algorithm due to its potential
application. However, its application in surface path planning for mobile
robots remains largely unexplored. In this letter, a surface optimal path
planning algorithm called RM-Dijkstra is proposed, which is based on Riemannian
metric model. By constructing a new Riemannian metric on the 2D projection
plane, the surface optimal path planning problem is therefore transformed into
a geometric problem on the 2D plane with new Riemannian metric. Induced by the
standard Euclidean metric on surface, the constructed new metric reflects
environmental information of the robot and ensures that the projection map is
an isometric immersion. By conducting a series of simulation tests, the
experimental results demonstrate that the RM-Dijkstra algorithm not only
effectively solves the optimal path planning problem on surfaces, but also
outperforms traditional path planning algorithms in terms of path accuracy and
smoothness, particularly in complex scenarios.

Abstract: The transport industry has recently shown significant interest in unmanned
surface vehicles (USVs), specifically for port and inland waterway transport.
These systems can improve operational efficiency and safety, which is
especially relevant in the European Union, where initiatives such as the Green
Deal are driving a shift towards increased use of inland waterways. At the same
time, a shortage of qualified personnel is accelerating the adoption of
autonomous solutions. However, there is a notable lack of open-source,
high-fidelity simulation frameworks and datasets for developing and evaluating
such solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce AirSim For Surface
Vehicles (ASVSim), an open-source simulation framework specifically designed
for autonomous shipping research in inland and port environments. The framework
combines simulated vessel dynamics with marine sensor simulation capabilities,
including radar and camera systems and supports the generation of synthetic
datasets for training computer vision models and reinforcement learning agents.
Built upon Cosys-AirSim, ASVSim provides a comprehensive platform for
developing autonomous navigation algorithms and generating synthetic datasets.
The simulator supports research of both traditional control methods and deep
learning-based approaches. Through limited experiments, we demonstrate the
potential of the simulator in these research areas. ASVSim is provided as an
open-source project under the MIT license, making autonomous navigation
research accessible to a larger part of the ocean engineering community.

initial configurations, interpretable for generating motion policies, and
requires no human demonstrations or training. Grasp and target waypoints for
future DLO states are planned from the current DLO shape. Grasp poses are
computed from indexing the tracked piecewise linear curve representing the DLO

Abstract: Accurate weed management is essential for mitigating significant crop yield
losses, necessitating effective weed suppression strategies in agricultural
systems. Integrating cover crops (CC) offers multiple benefits, including soil
erosion reduction, weed suppression, decreased nitrogen requirements, and
enhanced carbon sequestration, all of which are closely tied to the aboveground
biomass (AGB) they produce. However, biomass production varies significantly
due to microsite variability, making accurate estimation and mapping essential
for identifying zones of poor weed suppression and optimizing targeted
management strategies. To address this challenge, developing a comprehensive CC
map, including its AGB distribution, will enable informed decision-making
regarding weed control methods and optimal application rates. Manual visual
inspection is impractical and labor-intensive, especially given the extensive
field size and the wide diversity and variation of weed species and sizes. In
this context, optical imagery and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are
two prominent sources with unique characteristics that enhance AGB estimation.
This study introduces a ground robot-mounted multimodal sensor system designed
for agricultural field mapping. The system integrates optical and LiDAR data,
leveraging machine learning (ML) methods for data fusion to improve biomass
predictions. The best ML-based model for dry AGB estimation achieved a
coefficient of determination value of 0.88, demonstrating robust performance in
diverse field conditions. This approach offers valuable insights for
site-specific management, enabling precise weed suppression strategies and
promoting sustainable farming practices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可验证安全的随机神经控制屏障函数（SNCBFs）合成方法，填补了随机NCBFs研究的空白，并验证了其有效性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在确定性神经控制屏障函数（NCBFs）的验证与合成，而随机NCBFs（SNCBFs）的研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了两种框架：1）无需验证的平滑SNCBFs合成框架；2）验证循环的平滑及ReLU SNCBFs合成框架。

Result: 在倒立摆、Darboux和独轮车模型中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文为随机NCBFs的安全合成提供了新方法，并在实际案例中验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are utilized to ensure the safety of control
systems. CBFs act as safety filters in order to provide safety guarantees
without compromising system performance. These safety guarantees rely on the
construction of valid CBFs. Due to their complexity, CBFs can be represented by
neural networks, known as neural CBFs (NCBFs). Existing works on the
verification of the NCBF focus on the synthesis and verification of NCBFs in
deterministic settings, leaving the stochastic NCBFs (SNCBFs) less studied. In
this work, we propose a verifiably safe synthesis for SNCBFs. We consider the
cases of smooth SNCBFs with twice-differentiable activation functions and
SNCBFs that utilize the Rectified Linear Unit or ReLU activation function. We
propose a verification-free synthesis framework for smooth SNCBFs and a
verification-in-the-loop synthesis framework for both smooth and ReLU SNCBFs.
and we validate our frameworks in three cases, namely, the inverted pendulum,
Darboux, and the unicycle model.

Abstract: With an increasing share of renewable energy sources, accurate and efficient
modeling of grid-forming inverters is becoming crucial for system stability.
Linear methods are a powerful tool for understanding dynamics close to an
operating point, but usually depend on the reference trajectory. Thus, small
deviations can render linear models invalid over time, posing a significant
challenge in practice, and complicating theoretical analysis. As a solution, we
show that the complex phase offers a robust formulation independent of
reference phases and frequencies, thus preserving invariance properties under
linearization. This enables robust system identification during realistic
conditions and opens the road to powerful stability analysis of inverter-based
grids.

Abstract: Considering linear-quadratic discrete-time games with unknown
input/output/state (i/o/s) dynamics and state, we provide necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of feedback Nash
equilibria (FNE) in the finite-horizon game, based entirely on offline
input/output data. We prove that the finite-horizon unknown-dynamics game and
its corresponding known-dynamics game have the same FNEs, and provide detailed
relationships between their respective FNE matrices. To simplify the
computation of FNEs, we provide an invertibility condition and a corresponding
algorithm that computes one FNE by solving a finite number of linear equation
systems using offline data. For the infinite-horizon unknown-dynamics game,
limited offline data restricts players to computing optimal strategies only
over a finite horizon. We prove that the finite-horizon strategy ``watching $T$
steps into the future and moving one step now,'' which is commonly used in
classical optimal control, exhibits convergence in both the FNE matrices and
the total costs in the infinite-horizon unknown-dynamics game, and further
provide an analysis of the convergence rate of the total cost. The
corresponding algorithm for the infinite-horizon game is proposed and its
efficacy is demonstrated through a non-scalar numerical example.

Conclusion: 提出的HJB-GNN框架有效解决了多智能体导航中的安全与性能问题，适用于复杂环境和未知场景。

Abstract: Distributed multi-agent navigation faces inherent challenges due to the
competing requirements of maintaining safety and achieving goal-directed
behavior, particularly for agents with limited sensing range operating in
unknown environments with dense obstacles. Existing approaches typically
project predefined goal-reaching controllers onto control barrier function
(CBF) constraints, often resulting in conservative and suboptimal trade-offs
between safety and goal-reaching performance. We propose an infinite-horizon
CBF-constrained optimal graph control formulation for distributed safe
multi-agent navigation. By deriving the analytical solution structure, we
develop a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)-based learning framework to
approximate the solution. In particular, our algorithm jointly learns a CBF and
a distributed control policy, both parameterized by graph neural networks
(GNNs), along with a value function that robustly guides agents toward their
goals. Moreover, we introduce a state-dependent parameterization of Lagrange
multipliers, enabling dynamic trade-offs between safety and performance. Unlike
traditional short-horizon, quadratic programming-based CBF methods, our
approach leverages long-horizon optimization to proactively avoid deadlocks and
navigate complex environments more effectively. Extensive simulation results
demonstrate substantial improvements in safety and task success rates across
various agent dynamics, with strong scalability and generalization to
large-scale teams in previously unseen environments. Real-world experiments
using Crazyflie drone swarms on challenging antipodal position-swapping tasks
further validate the practicality, generalizability, and robustness of the
proposed HJB-GNN learning framework.

Abstract: The intensive integration of power converters is changing the way that power
systems operate, leading to the emergence of new types of dynamic phenomena and
instabilities. At the same time, converters act as an interface between
traditional AC grids and their more recent DC counterparts, giving rise to
hybrid AC/DC networks. These conditions increase the necessity for stability
analysis tools that can simultaneously account for the newly-introduced dynamic
phenomena and can also be applied for the stability study of hybrid networks.
This paper presents a Matlab-based toolbox for small-signal analysis of hybrid
AC/DC power systems considering electromagnetic-transient (EMT) models. The
toolbox allows the automatized modeling of the system from the input data and
offers options for modal, impedance and passivity analyses. In the paper, the
structure and internal processes of the toolbox are duly discussed, together
with all its features, both main and complementary. Its capabilities for
stability analysis are demonstrated via comprehensive case studies of
converter-based system of various size and topology.

Abstract: In the realm of Cyber-Physical System (CPS), accurately identifying attacks
without detailed knowledge of the system's parameters remains a major
challenge. When it comes to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS),
identifying the parameters of vehicle dynamics could be impractical or
prohibitively costly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework
for attack detection in vehicles that effectively addresses the uncertainty in
their dynamics. Our method integrates the widely used Unscented Kalman Filter
(UKF), a well-known technique for nonlinear state estimation in dynamic
systems, with machine learning algorithms. This combination eliminates the
requirement for precise vehicle modeling in the detection process, enhancing
the system's adaptability and accuracy. To validate the efficacy and
practicality of our proposed framework, we conducted extensive comparative
simulations by introducing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the vehicle
systems' sensors and actuators.

Result: 证明该方法的经济性能不劣于任意已知参考轨迹，并在仿真中显示其能有效降低电费。

Conclusion: 所提EMPC方法适用于实时微电网调度，无需先验最优轨迹，且能显著降低电费。

Abstract: Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC), instead of stabilizing a reference
trajectory/state in the objective function like a Tracking MPC, optimizes the
economic performance over the prediction horizon, making it attractive for
economical microgrid (MG) dispatch. However, the demand charge component in the
monthly electricity cost, make it difficult to be encapsulated in additive
stage costs, and can make solutions violate the principle of optimality if
naively introduced in the objective function. Moreover, previous EMPC based
works mostly rely on a-priori knowledge of an optimal economic steady state or
optimal periodic trajectory for performance guarantees, which are not useful or
possibly don't exist respectively, for real-time economical MG dispatch where
load/generation forecasts are known only 24-48 h in advance. This paper, first,
proposes an EMPC formulation for a generic deterministic discrete non-linear
time varying system with hard state and input constraints, without any a-priori
requirements of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic
trajectory. It is proved that under mild assumptions on terminal cost and
region, the asymptotic average economic cost of the proposed method is no worse
than the asymptotic average economic cost of any other non-fixed arbitrary
reference trajectory which is known only until the current time-step. The EMPC
framework is then leveraged for optimal MG dispatch by showing that the problem
can be reformulated to satisfy the assumptions required for the asymptotic
performance guarantee. Realistic simulations at the Port of San Diego MG
demonstrated that the proposed method can also reduce monthly electricity costs
in closed-loop with respect to reference trajectories generated by directly
optimizing the electricity cost function over the prediction horizon or by
tracking an ideal grid import curve in a majority of the cases.

Abstract: Motor-actuated pendulums have been established as arguably the most common
laboratory prototypes used in control system education because of the relevance
to robot manipulator control in industry. Meanwhile, multi-rotor drones like
quadcopters have become popular in industrial applications but have not been
broadly employed in control education laboratory. Platforms with pendulums and
multi-rotor copters present classical yet intriguing multi-degree of freedom
(DoF) dynamics and coordinate systems for the control system investigation. In
this paper, we introduce a novel control platform in which a 2-DoF pendulum
capable of azimuth and elevation rotation is actuated through vectored thrust
generated by a quadcopter. Designed as a benchmark for mechatronics and
nonlinear control education and research, the system integrates detailed
mechatronic implementation with different control strategies. Specifically, we
apply and compare small perturbation linearization (SPL), state feedback
linearization (SFL), and partial feedback linearization (PFL) to the nonlinear
system dynamics. The performances are evaluated by time specifications of step
response and Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error of trajectory tracking. The
robustness of the closed-loop system is validated under external disturbances,
and both simulation and experimental results are presented to highlight the
strengths and limitations of the nonlinear model-based control approaches.

Motivation: 现有神经渲染技术在输入图像因快速运动而模糊时表现不佳，SPAD传感器的高速成像能力为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 引入PhotonSplat框架，直接从SPAD二进制图像重建3D场景，采用新型3D空间滤波技术降噪，并支持无参考和有参考的颜色化方法。

Result: 成功实现了从模糊图像中高质量3D重建，并扩展至动态场景，同时贡献了PhotonScenes数据集。

Conclusion: PhotonSplat框架有效解决了运动模糊问题，为3D重建提供了新思路，并支持多种下游应用。

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction using neural rendering have enabled
high-quality 3D capture. However, they often fail when the input imagery is
corrupted by motion blur, due to fast motion of the camera or the objects in
the scene. This work advances neural rendering techniques in such scenarios by
using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays, an emerging sensing
technology capable of sensing images at extremely high speeds. However, the use
of SPADs presents its own set of unique challenges in the form of binary
images, that are driven by stochastic photon arrivals. To address this, we
introduce PhotonSplat, a framework designed to reconstruct 3D scenes directly
from SPAD binary images, effectively navigating the noise vs. blur trade-off.
Our approach incorporates a novel 3D spatial filtering technique to reduce
noise in the renderings. The framework also supports both no-reference using
generative priors and reference-based colorization from a single blurry image,
enabling downstream applications such as segmentation, object detection and
appearance editing tasks. Additionally, we extend our method to incorporate
dynamic scene representations, making it suitable for scenes with moving
objects. We further contribute PhotonScenes, a real-world multi-view dataset
captured with the SPAD sensors.

Challenge design, summarises the key characteristics of the dataset, provides a
concise literature review, introduces the technical details of the underlying
methodology working with tracked freehand ultrasound data, and offers a
comparative analysis of submitted methods across multiple evaluation metrics.
The results highlight both the progress and current limitations of
state-of-the-art approaches in this domain, and inform directions for future
research. The data, evaluation code, and baseline are publicly available to
facilitate ongoing development and reproducibility. As a live and evolving

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了IHI重建中的关键问题，为深度学习在IHI中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) is a critical technique for
large-scale remote sensing tasks due to its advantages in flux and spectral
resolution. However, IHI is susceptible to complex errors arising from imaging
steps, and its quality is limited by existing signal processing-based
reconstruction algorithms. Two key challenges hinder performance enhancement:
1) the lack of training datasets. 2) the difficulty in eliminating IHI-specific
degradation components through learning-based methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel IHI reconstruction pipeline. First, based on
imaging physics and radiometric calibration data, we establish a simplified yet
accurate IHI degradation model and a parameter estimation method. This model
enables the synthesis of realistic IHI training datasets from hyperspectral
images (HSIs), bridging the gap between IHI reconstruction and deep learning.
Second, we design the Interferometric Hyperspectral Reconstruction Unfolding
Transformer (IHRUT), which achieves effective spectral correction and detail
restoration through a stripe-pattern enhancement mechanism and a
spatial-spectral transformer architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance and generalization capability of our method.

Result: 实验表明，UnMix-NeRF在光谱重建和材料分割上优于现有方法，并支持基于材料的场景编辑。

Conclusion: UnMix-NeRF为NeRF引入了材料感知能力，拓展了其在多领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object
semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties.
This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for
robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce
UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling
joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material
segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular
components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure
material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For
material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned
endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF
enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible
material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our
approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material
segmentation to existing methods. Project page:

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，同时保持高保真和实时性。

Conclusion: StableCodec在超低比特率下实现了高保真和高效率的图像压缩。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has shown remarkable potential for
achieving ultra-low bitrate coding (less than 0.05 bits per pixel) with high
realism, by leveraging the generative priors of large pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, current approaches require a large number of
denoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme
bitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression
scenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity,
as diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To
address these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step
diffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with
improved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an
efficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent
representation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a
Dual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and
decoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we adopt end-to-end
optimization with joint bitrate and pixel-level constraints. Extensive
experiments on the CLIC 2020, DIV2K, and Kodak dataset demonstrate that
StableCodec outperforms existing methods in terms of FID, KID and DISTS by a
significant margin, even at bitrates as low as 0.005 bits per pixel, while
maintaining strong fidelity. Additionally, StableCodec achieves inference
speeds comparable to mainstream transform coding schemes. All source code are

Abstract: The generalization of deep learning-based low-dose computed tomography (CT)
reconstruction models to doses unseen in the training data is important and
remains challenging. Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve
the generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse
CT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion
models have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)
reconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT
image noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior
information from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a
noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed
NEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.
First, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection
data, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT
projections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine
reconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions
to more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction
fidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain
reconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be
effectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time
step matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and
segmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and
generalization performance. Source code is made available at

*Julia Machnio,Sebastian Nørgaard Llambias,Mads Nielsen,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的白质高信号（WMH）分割和定位框架，支持单模态和多模态MRI输入，评估了四种输入配置，发现多模态输入显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 白质高信号（WMH）是神经退行性疾病的标志，现有方法在模态缺失和空间定位方面存在不足，需更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用深度学习框架，支持单模态和多模态MRI输入，评估了四种输入配置，并引入多任务模型联合预测病变和区域掩码。

Result: 多模态输入显著提升分割性能，但多任务学习效果不如单独模型，表明任务间存在表征冲突。

Conclusion: 多模态融合对WMH分析准确性和鲁棒性至关重要，联合建模在集成预测方面具有潜力。

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are radiological markers of small vessel
disease and neurodegeneration, whose accurate segmentation and spatial
localization are crucial for diagnosis and monitoring. While multimodal MRI
offers complementary contrasts for detecting and contextualizing WM lesions,
existing approaches often lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and
fail to integrate anatomical localization efficiently. We propose a deep
learning framework for WM lesion segmentation and localization that operates
directly in native space using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs. Our study
evaluates four input configurations: FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR
and T1, and a modality-interchangeable setup. It further introduces a
multi-task model for jointly predicting lesion and anatomical region masks to
estimate region-wise lesion burden. Experiments conducted on the MICCAI WMH
Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that multimodal input significantly
improves the segmentation performance, outperforming unimodal models. While the
modality-interchangeable setting trades accuracy for robustness, it enables
inference in cases with missing modalities. Joint lesion-region segmentation
using multi-task learning was less effective than separate models, suggesting
representational conflict between tasks. Our findings highlight the utility of
multimodal fusion for accurate and robust WMH analysis, and the potential of
joint modeling for integrated predictions.

Abstract: Automatic detection and classification of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) from
Computed Tomography (CT) images play an important part in facilitating
better-informed clinical decisions. However, most of the recent deep learning
based methods either directly work on raw CT data or utilize it in pair with
anatomical cardiac structure segmentation by training an end-to-end classifier.
As such, these approaches become much more difficult to interpret from a
clinical perspective. To address this challenge, in this work, we break down
the CVD classification pipeline into three components: (i) image segmentation,
(ii) image registration, and (iii) downstream CVD classification. Specifically,
we utilize the Atlas-ISTN framework and recent segmentation foundational models
to generate anatomical structure segmentation and a normative healthy atlas.
These are further utilized to extract clinically interpretable radiomic
features as well as deformation field based geometric features (through atlas
registration) for CVD classification. Our experiments on the publicly available
ASOCA dataset show that utilizing these features leads to better CVD
classification accuracy (87.50\%) when compared against classification model
trained directly on raw CT images (67.50\%). Our code is publicly available:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自由变形（FFD）的空间基函数和变形感知框架，用于动态CBCT重建，解决了现有方法计算成本高和运动不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态CBCT重建中，现有方法如HexPlane计算成本高，且缺乏空间正则化导致运动不一致。

Method: 引入FFD空间基函数和变形感知框架，统一高斯均位、尺度和旋转的时变演化。

Result: 在六个CBCT数据集上验证，图像质量优于HexPlane，速度提升6倍。

Conclusion: 变形感知4DGS为高效、运动补偿的CBCT重建提供了潜力。

Abstract: 3D Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in radiotherapy but suffers from motion
artifacts due to breathing. A common clinical approach mitigates this by
sorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per
phase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT
instead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion
without phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)
offer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to
dynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane,
use implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While
explicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial
regularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these
limitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis
function and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by
coupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and
rotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six
CBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over
HexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS
for efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at

*Anirban Ray,Ashesh,Florian Jug*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HazeMatching是一种新型迭代方法，用于去雾光学显微镜图像，有效平衡了数据保真度和感知真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在去雾过程中无法同时兼顾数据保真度和感知真实性的问题。

Method: 采用条件流匹配框架，通过条件速度场引导生成过程，无需显式退化算子。

Result: 在5个数据集上评估，HazeMatching在保真度和真实性之间取得了平衡，优于7个基线方法。

Conclusion: HazeMatching是一种无需显式退化算子的有效去雾方法，适用于真实显微镜数据。

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life
sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering
out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as
widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.
Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to
cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off
tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high
PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.
Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or
produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In
this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light
microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to
find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the
realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the
conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a
hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on
5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion
and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a
consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with
calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated
predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation
operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All
data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available
under a permissive license.

### [244] [Single-shot HDR using conventional image sensor shutter functions and optical randomization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22426)
*Xiang Dai,Kyrollos Yanny,Kristina Monakhova,Nicholas Antipa*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种单次曝光高动态范围（HDR）成像方法，利用传感器全局复位释放（GRR）快门模式和光学随机排列技术，通过优化问题恢复HDR数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HDR成像依赖多次曝光，导致动态场景中出现运动伪影。单次曝光HDR成像虽能解决此问题，但在高光区域表现不佳。

Method: 使用GRR快门模式和光学随机排列技术，通过优化问题和简单的总变分图像先验恢复HDR数据。

Result: 仿真显示，该方法在大量像素饱和（10%以上）时优于其他单次曝光方法，在少量饱和（1%）时表现相当。物理原型动态范围达73dB。

Conclusion: 该方法通过GRR快门和光学随机排列技术，有效提升了单次曝光HDR成像的性能，尤其在处理高光区域时表现优异。

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the
dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple
exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging
dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR
data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many
established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image
detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize
the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR
shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the
sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the
sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.
The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization
problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we
demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many
sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest
saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an
off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle
is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our
prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with
48dB dynamic range.
