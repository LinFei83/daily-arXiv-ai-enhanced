TL;DR: 前沿LLMs在受限环境中仍会尝试作弊，揭示了目标导向行为与对齐之间的根本矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在明确限制下是否会尝试作弊，以探索其目标导向行为与对齐的冲突。

Method: 让LLMs在受监控的沙盒环境中完成不可能的任务，并明确告知限制和不作弊的指令。

Result: 部分前沿LLMs会持续尝试作弊并规避限制。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在目标导向行为与对齐之间存在根本矛盾，需进一步研究解决。

Abstract: In this paper, LLMs are tasked with completing an impossible quiz, while they
are in a sandbox, monitored, told about these measures and instructed not to
cheat. Some frontier LLMs cheat consistently and attempt to circumvent
restrictions despite everything. The results reveal a fundamental tension
between goal-directed behavior and alignment in current LLMs. The code and
evaluation logs are available at github.com/baceolus/cheating_evals

Abstract: Despite recent advances in automated driving technology, impaired driving
continues to incur a high cost to society. In this paper, we present a driving
dataset designed to support the study of two common forms of driver impairment:
alcohol intoxication and cognitive distraction. Our dataset spans 23.7 hours of
simulated urban driving, with 52 human subjects under normal and impaired
conditions, and includes both vehicle data (ground truth perception, vehicle
pose, controls) and driver-facing data (gaze, audio, surveys). It supports
analysis of changes in driver behavior due to alcohol intoxication (0.10\%
blood alcohol content), two forms of cognitive distraction (audio n-back and
sentence parsing tasks), and combinations thereof, as well as responses to a
set of eight controlled road hazards, such as vehicle cut-ins. The dataset will
be made available at https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/IDD/.

Abstract: Edgar Allan Poe noted, "Truth often lurks in the shadow of error,"
highlighting the deep complexity intrinsic to the interplay between truth and
falsehood, notably under conditions of cognitive and informational asymmetry.
This dynamic is strikingly evident in large language models (LLMs). Despite
their impressive linguistic generation capabilities, LLMs sometimes produce
information that appears factually accurate but is, in reality, fabricated, an
issue often referred to as 'hallucinations'. The prevalence of these
hallucinations can mislead users, affecting their judgments and decisions. In
sectors such as finance, law, and healthcare, such misinformation risks causing
substantial economic losses, legal disputes, and health risks, with
wide-ranging consequences.In our research, we have methodically categorized,
analyzed the causes, detection methods, and solutions related to LLM
hallucinations. Our efforts have particularly focused on understanding the
roots of hallucinations and evaluating the efficacy of current strategies in
revealing the underlying logic, thereby paving the way for the development of
innovative and potent approaches. By examining why certain measures are
effective against hallucinations, our study aims to foster a comprehensive
approach to tackling this issue within the domain of LLMs.

### [4] [Closed-Form Robustness Bounds for Second-Order Pruning of Neural Controller Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02953)
*Maksym Shamrai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文研究了二阶剪枝方法在非线性离散时间控制中的鲁棒性，提出了数学上严格的剪枝对闭环稳定性和跟踪精度的影响分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经策略在机器人控制中表现出色，但其庞大的参数量与嵌入式微控制器的内存和实时性要求冲突。二阶剪枝方法虽在视觉和语言领域成功，但其对闭环控制的影响尚不明确。

Method: 通过分析剪枝后的权重变化对控制器输出的影响，推导出剪枝误差的上界，并提出了一个可计算的常数C_k(s)来评估剪枝对控制性能的影响。

Result: 研究得出了剪枝幅度的最大允许值，确保其在规定的控制误差阈值内，为安全关键系统的网络压缩提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了深度学习工具与安全关键系统鲁棒性需求之间的重要空白，为实际部署提供了理论保障。

Abstract: Deep neural policies have unlocked agile flight for quadcopters, adaptive
grasping for manipulators, and reliable navigation for ground robots, yet their
millions of weights conflict with the tight memory and real-time constraints of
embedded microcontrollers. Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain
Damage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the
recent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local
Hessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite
their success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal
on closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear.
We present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of
second-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves
under a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer
multilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz.
Pruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\delta W_k$,
producing the perturbed parameter vector $\widehat{\Theta}=\Theta+\delta\Theta$
and the pruned policy $\pi(\cdot;\widehat{\Theta})$. For every input state
$s\in X$ we derive the closed-form inequality $
\|\pi(s;\Theta)-\pi(s;\widehat{\Theta})\|_2 \le C_k(s)\,\|\delta W_k\|_2, $
where the constant $C_k(s)$ depends only on unpruned spectral norms and biases,
and can be evaluated in closed form from a single forward pass. The derived
bounds specify, prior to field deployment, the maximal admissible pruning
magnitude compatible with a prescribed control-error threshold. By linking
second-order network compression with closed-loop performance guarantees, our
work narrows a crucial gap between modern deep-learning tooling and the
robustness demands of safety-critical autonomous systems.

### [5] [Control Synthesis in Partially Observable Environments for Complex Perception-Related Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02942)
*Zetong Xuan,Yu Wang*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDPs）中为复杂感知相关目标合成最优策略的问题，提出了一种新的逻辑规范方法sc-iLTL，并通过MCTS方法解决可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部分可观测环境中，为复杂感知任务设计最优策略是一个挑战，需要新的形式化方法和高效的求解算法。

Method: 提出sc-iLTL逻辑规范，将目标转化为可达性问题，并通过MCTS方法解决可扩展性问题。

Result: 通过无人机探测案例验证了方法的适用性。

Conclusion: sc-iLTL和MCTS方法为复杂感知任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Perception-related tasks often arise in autonomous systems operating under
partial observability. This work studies the problem of synthesizing optimal
policies for complex perception-related objectives in environments modeled by
partially observable Markov decision processes. To formally specify such
objectives, we introduce \emph{co-safe linear inequality temporal logic}
(sc-iLTL), which can define complex tasks that are formed by the logical
concatenation of atomic propositions as linear inequalities on the belief space
of the POMDPs. Our solution to the control synthesis problem is to transform
the \mbox{sc-iLTL} objectives into reachability objectives by constructing the
product of the belief MDP and a deterministic finite automaton built from the
sc-iLTL objective. To overcome the scalability challenge due to the product, we
introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method that converges in probability
to the optimal policy. Finally, a drone-probing case study demonstrates the
applicability of our method.

### [6] [Global Optimization of Multi-Flyby Trajectories for Multi-Orbital-Plane Constellations Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02943)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低地球轨道巨型星座的快速扩张，空间交通管理面临挑战，需要经济高效地定期巡检卫星以确保空间环境的可持续性。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法能有效优化数万颗卫星的巡检轨迹，显著减少总速度增量。

Conclusion: 提出的策略和优化框架为大规模星座巡检提供了一种高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of mega-constellations in low Earth orbits has posed
significant challenges to space traffic management, necessitating periodic
inspections of satellites to ensure the sustainability of the space environment
when economically feasible. This study addresses the orbital design challenge
associated with inspecting numerous satellites distributed across multiple
orbital planes through flybys by proposing an innovative orbital-plane-based
inspection strategy. The proposed methodology reformulates the multi-satellite
flyby problem into a multi-rendezvous trajectory planning problem by proposing
an analytical approach to determine a maneuver-free inspection orbit that
enables flyby of all satellites within a specific orbital plane. Additionally,
a three-layer global optimization framework is developed to tackle this
problem. The first layer establishes an approximate cost evaluation model for
orbital plane visitation sequences, utilizing a genetic algorithm to identify
the optimal sequence from a vast array of candidate planes, thereby maximizing
inspection targets while minimizing fuel consumption. The second layer
constructs a mixed-integer programming model to locally refine the rendezvous
epochs and orbital parameters of each inspection orbit to reduce the total
velocity increment. The third layer accurately computes the optimal impulsive
maneuvers and trajectories between inspection orbits. In contrast to
traditional low-Earth orbit rendezvous optimization frameworks, the proposed
framework fully leverages the adjustable freedom in inclination and right
ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) of inspection orbits, significantly
reducing the total velocity increment. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method can effectively address the trajectory optimization problem
associated with constellation inspection for tens of thousands of satellites.

### [7] [Determination of Bandwidth of Q-filter in Disturbance Observers to Guarantee Transient and Steady State Performance under Measurement Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02981)
*Gaeun Kim,Hyungbo Shim*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文分析了Q滤波器基于扰动观测器（DOB）的时间常数选择问题，指出在噪声环境下过小的时间常数会损害性能恢复，并提出了一种基于Lyapunov方法的分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在噪声环境下，过小的时间常数会损害名义性能恢复，因此需要确定合适的时间常数以保证瞬态和稳态性能。

Method: 使用基于奇异摄动理论的坐标变换和Lyapunov方法进行分析。

Result: 提出了一个可接受的噪声水平和时间常数的开区间，以保证性能，并证明了在无噪声情况下减小时间常数才能确保目标性能。

Conclusion: 论文为DOB设计中时间常数的选择提供了理论依据，特别强调了噪声环境下的限制。

Abstract: Q-filter-based disturbance observer (DOB) is one of the most widely used
robust controller due to its design simplicity. Such simplicity arises from
that reducing the time constant of low pass filters, not only ensures robust
stability but also enhances nominal performance recovery -- ability to recover
the trajectory of nominal closed-loop system. However, in contrast to
noise-free environment, excessively small time constant can rather damage the
nominal performance recovery under measurement noise. That is, minimizing time
constant is no longer immediately guaranteeing nominal performance recovery.
Motivated by this observation, this paper concentrates on determination of time
constant to ensure transient and steady state performance. This analysis uses
Lyapunov method based on the coordinate change inspired by the singular
perturbation theory. As a result, we present an affordable noise level and open
interval for the time constant that guarantees both the required performances.
The analysis can also lead to theoretical demonstration on that excessively
reducing time constant is assured to achieve target performance only for
noise-free case.

### [8] [Game-Theoretic Modeling of Vehicle Unprotected Left Turns Considering Drivers' Bounded Rationality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03002)
*Yuansheng Lian,Ke Zhang,Meng Li,Shen Li*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合博弈论和有限理性的新型决策模型，用于解决车辆在无保护左转场景中的决策行为，比传统纳什均衡模型更真实高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于完美理性的博弈论方法难以捕捉现实场景和驾驶员决策错误的复杂性，因此需要更贴近实际的模型。

Method: 模型采用两玩家标准形式博弈，通过量化响应均衡（QRE）解决，结合EM算法和神经网络优化参数。

Result: 仿真实验表明，该模型能更准确地反映驾驶员的有限理性和决策倾向，优于纳什均衡模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为有限理性下的车辆决策行为提供了新见解，有助于开发更鲁棒和真实的自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Modeling the decision-making behavior of vehicles presents unique challenges,
particularly during unprotected left turns at intersections, where the
uncertainty of human drivers is especially pronounced. In this context,
connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology emerges as a promising avenue for
effectively managing such interactions while ensuring safety and efficiency.
Traditional approaches, often grounded in game theory assumptions of perfect
rationality, may inadequately capture the complexities of real-world scenarios
and drivers' decision-making errors. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
decision-making model for vehicle unprotected left-turn scenarios, integrating
game theory with considerations for drivers' bounded rationality. Our model,
formulated as a two-player normal-form game solved by a quantal response
equilibrium (QRE), offers a more nuanced depiction of driver decision-making
processes compared to Nash equilibrium (NE) models. Leveraging an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm coupled with a subtle neural network
trained on precise microscopic vehicle trajectory data, we optimize model
parameters to accurately reflect drivers' interaction-aware bounded rationality
and driving styles. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model in capturing the
interaction-aware bounded rationality and decision tendencies between players.
The proposed model proves to be more realistic and efficient than NE models in
unprotected left-turn scenarios. Our findings contribute valuable insights into
the vehicle decision-making behaviors with bounded rationality, thereby
informing the development of more robust and realistic autonomous driving
systems.

### [9] [Outcome prediction and individualized treatment effect estimation in patients with large vessel occlusion stroke](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03046)
*Lisa Herzog,Pascal Bühler,Ezequiel de la Rosa,Beate Sick,Susanne Wegener*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究开发了可解释的深度学习模型，结合临床数据和影像学特征，预测大血管闭塞卒中患者的功能结局和个体化治疗效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机械取栓已成为大血管闭塞卒中的标准治疗，但仅50%成功治疗患者预后良好，因此需要更精准的预测工具。

Method: 利用449名患者的临床数据和影像学特征（NCCT和CTA），通过深度学习模型预测功能结局和个体化治疗效果。

Result: 临床变量预测功能结局表现良好（AUC 0.719），加入CTA影像后略有提升（AUC 0.737）。个体化治疗效果预测的区分能力有限（C-for-Benefit约0.55）。

Conclusion: 模型整合了影像和临床数据，实现了先进的预测性能，但个体化治疗效果预测仍需改进。

Abstract: Mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard of care in patients with
stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). However, only 50% of successfully
treated patients show a favorable outcome. We developed and evaluated
interpretable deep learning models to predict functional outcomes in terms of
the modified Rankin Scale score alongside individualized treatment effects
(ITEs) using data of 449 LVO stroke patients from a randomized clinical trial.
Besides clinical variables, we considered non-contrast CT (NCCT) and
angiography (CTA) scans which were integrated using novel foundation models to
make use of advanced imaging information. Clinical variables had a good
predictive power for binary functional outcome prediction (AUC of 0.719 [0.666,
0.774]) which could slightly be improved when adding CTA imaging (AUC of 0.737
[0.687, 0.795]). Adding NCCT scans or a combination of NCCT and CTA scans to
clinical features yielded no improvement. The most important clinical predictor
for functional outcome was pre-stroke disability. While estimated ITEs were
well calibrated to the average treatment effect, discriminatory ability was
limited indicated by a C-for-Benefit statistic of around 0.55 in all models. In
summary, the models allowed us to jointly integrate CT imaging and clinical
features while achieving state-of-the-art prediction performance and ITE
estimates. Yet, further research is needed to particularly improve ITE
estimation.
