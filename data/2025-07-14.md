*Sishi Xiong,Dakai Wang,Yu Zhao,Jie Zhang,Changzai Pan,Haowei He,Xiangyu Li,Wenhan Chang,Zhongjiang He,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型和编程的表推理框架TableReasoner，用于解决表问答任务中的挑战，如数据量大、列语义不完整和实体歧义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表问答任务面临真实世界表格数据的挑战，如规模大、语义不完整和歧义问题，需要一种高效且精确的解决方法。

Method: 提出TableReasoner框架，结合结构化和语义表示的表模式，设计多步模式链接计划，生成聚焦表模式，并集成迭代思考架构。

Result: 该系统在SemEval-2025 Task 8的两个子任务中均获得第一名。

Conclusion: TableReasoner通过结合大语言模型和编程方法，有效解决了表问答任务中的复杂问题，并在实际评测中表现优异。

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular
data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To
address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and
programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a
table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations,
enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table
details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the
reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing
incremental cycles of thinking, reasoning and reflection. Our system achieves
first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8.

### [3] [A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Framework for Agentic AI Defense Against LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08207)
*Zhengye Han,Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态Stackelberg博弈框架，用于建模LLM越狱中的攻防交互，并提出了结合对抗探索和防御策略的"Purple Agent"解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在关键应用中的部署增加，越狱攻击（绕过安全机制）成为重要问题，需要有效的防御方法。

Method: 采用动态Stackelberg博弈框架，将提示-响应动态建模为序贯扩展博弈，并利用RRT算法实现对抗探索与防御策略的结合。

Result: 提出的"Purple Agent"能主动模拟攻击轨迹并干预，有效降低越狱风险。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析对抗动态提供了理论方法，并为缓解越狱风险奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

### [4] [Reasoning and Behavioral Equilibria in LLM-Nash Games: From Mindsets to Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08208)
*Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-Nash框架通过游戏理论模型研究LLM驱动的决策，关注有限理性下的推理均衡，与传统纳什均衡不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在决策中的有限理性行为，探索推理过程对战略互动的影响。

Method: 提出LLM-Nash框架，将均衡定义在提示空间，通过LLM推理生成行为。

Result: 推理均衡与传统纳什均衡存在差异，为LLM系统战略互动提供新视角。

Conclusion: LLM-Nash框架为理解有限理性和认知约束下的战略互动提供了新工具。

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

### [5] [From Curiosity to Competence: How World Models Interact with the Dynamics of Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08210)
*Fryderyk Mantiuk,Hanqi Zhou,Charley M. Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了智能体如何在探索（好奇心）与控制（能力）之间取得平衡，通过比较两种模型（Tabular和Dreamer）揭示了探索与表征学习的双向互动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究智能体如何平衡好奇心（寻求知识）和能力（控制环境），以理解探索与控制的动态关系。

Method: 比较两种模型：基于手工状态抽象的Tabular代理和基于学习内部世界模型的Dreamer代理。

Result: Tabular代理显示好奇心和能力引导探索的不同模式，而Dreamer代理揭示了探索与表征学习的双向互动。

Conclusion: 研究为认知理论和高效强化学习提供了见解，形式化了适应性探索的平衡机制。

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

Abstract: For developing innovative systems architectures, modeling and optimization
techniques have been central to frame the architecting process and define the
optimization and modeling problems. In this context, for system-of-systems the
use of efficient dedicated approaches (often physics-based simulations) is
highly recommended to reduce the computational complexity of the targeted
applications. However, exploring novel architectures using such dedicated
approaches might pose challenges for optimization algorithms, including
increased evaluation costs and potential failures. To address these challenges,
surrogate-based optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization
utilizing Gaussian process models have emerged.

### [7] [Grounding Methods for Neural-Symbolic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08216)
*Rodrigo Castellano Ontiveros,Francesco Giannini,Marco Gori,Giuseppe Marra,Michelangelo Diligenti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种参数化的逻辑接地方法，平衡了表达能力和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经符号方法中逻辑接地导致的组合爆炸或启发式方法缺乏理论保证的问题。

Result: 实验表明接地标准的选择对神经符号方法至关重要。

Conclusion: 参数化接地方法在表达能力和可扩展性之间提供了灵活的选择。

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

### [8] [Quantum Federated Learning for Multimodal Data: A Modality-Agnostic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08217)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的多模态量子联邦学习方法，利用量子纠缠实现中间融合，并引入缺失模态无关（MMA）机制以解决训练中模态缺失问题。实验显示，该方法在IID和非IID数据分布下分别提升了6.84%和7.25%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量子联邦学习（QFL）框架主要针对单模态系统，限制了其在现实多模态任务中的应用。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出多模态QFL方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于量子纠缠的中间融合多模态QFL方法，并引入MMA机制以隔离未训练的量子电路，确保训练稳定性。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在IID和非IID数据分布下的准确率分别提升了6.84%和7.25%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的多模态QFL方法及MMA机制显著提升了模型性能，为现实多模态任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

paper argues, could lead to formidable new vectors of AI harm. To support this
argument, we first examine the unique properties of cryptocurrencies and smart
contracts that could lead to these new vectors of harm. Next, we describe each
of these new vectors of harm in detail. Finally, we conclude with a call for
more technical research aimed at preventing and mitigating these harms and,
thereby making it safer to endow AI agents with cryptocurrencies and smart
contracts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨溯因推理在不同领域的理解差异，并评估其在计算系统中的实现情况。

Method: 通过文献综述和分析计算系统的溯因推理实现方式。

Result: 理论和计算系统均未有效支持创造性溯因假设的生成。

Conclusion: 提出未来研究方向以推动计算系统中创造性溯因推理的发展。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

### [11] [Agent Safety Alignment via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08270)
*Zeyang Sha,Hanling Tian,Zhuoer Xu,Shiwen Cui,Changhua Meng,Weiqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的安全对齐框架，用于处理使用工具的自主LLM代理的安全风险，包括用户和工具引发的威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主LLM代理的工具使用能力带来了新的安全风险，传统方法无法应对。

Method: 提出了一种基于结构化推理和沙盒强化学习的框架，包括三模态分类和政策驱动决策模型。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了代理对安全威胁的抵抗能力，同时保持了良性任务的性能。

Conclusion: 安全与有效性可以共同优化，为自主LLM代理的可信部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M2-Reasoning-7B模型通过创新的数据管道和动态多任务训练策略，解决了MLLMs在动态空间交互上的不足，并在8个基准测试中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在动态空间交互能力上存在不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出M2-Reasoning-7B模型，结合高质量数据生成（294.2K样本）和动态多任务训练策略（任务特定奖励）。

Result: 在8个基准测试中达到SOTA，尤其在通用和空间推理领域表现优异。

Conclusion: M2-Reasoning-7B通过数据与训练策略的创新，显著提升了MLLMs的动态空间交互能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

### [13] [Multi-Agent LLMs as Ethics Advocates in AI-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08392)
*Asma Yamani,Malak Baslyman,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体LLM的框架，通过伦理倡导代理自动生成伦理需求草案，以解决人工需求获取的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工获取伦理需求效率低且优先级不高，需解决时间和资源限制问题。

Method: 引入伦理倡导代理，在多智能体LLM环境中批判和提供伦理建议。

Result: 框架能捕捉大部分人工识别的伦理需求，并补充新需求，但可靠性需人工反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于推动伦理需求在工程中的广泛应用，但需结合人工审核。

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

Abstract: We define several canonical problems related to contrastive explanations,
each answering a question of the form ''Why P but not Q?''. The problems
compute causes for both P and Q, explicitly comparing their differences. We
investigate the basic properties of our definitions in the setting of
propositional logic. We show, inter alia, that our framework captures a
cardinality-minimal version of existing contrastive explanations in the
literature. Furthermore, we provide an extensive analysis of the computational
complexities of the problems. We also implement the problems for CNF-formulas
using answer set programming and present several examples demonstrating how
they work in practice.

*Keying Yang,Hao Wang,Kai Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层框架，将自然语言映射到逻辑表示，通过任务抽象和逻辑生成两阶段实现，显著提升了推理准确性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言输入与形式逻辑表示之间的差距，实现模块化推理和明确约束。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，准确率提升高达40%，同时增强了透明度和错误追踪能力。

Conclusion: 双层框架为LLM提供了可信赖和系统化的推理方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

Result: 在BioASQ罕见病QA集上，BLEU提升0.09，ROUGE提升0.05，准确率提升0.12，峰值准确率达0.89。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了信息质量、推理能力和专业表达，有望缩短罕见病患者的诊断周期。

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大型多模态模型（LMM）自动地理参考生物样本记录的新方法，通过视觉化空间关系，显著提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然历史收藏中大量未地理参考的生物样本记录问题，传统方法耗时且低效。

Result: 实验显示该方法平均距离误差约1公里，优于单模态模型和现有工具。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LMM在精细地图理解中的潜力，并提出了将其整合到地理参考工作流程的框架。

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

### [19] [Agentic Large Language Models for Conceptual Systems Engineering and Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08619)
*Soheyl Massoudi,Mark Fuge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了多智能体系统（MAS）在早期工程设计中的表现，比较了它与双智能体系统（2AS）在需求提取、功能分解和代码生成方面的效果。结果显示，MAS在生成更细粒度的设计状态图（DSG）方面表现更好，但代码兼容性和需求覆盖率仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期工程设计需要复杂的迭代推理，现有的大语言模型（LLM）工作流难以保持任务连续性和生成可执行模型。研究旨在评估结构化多智能体系统是否能更有效地管理设计过程。

Method: 引入设计状态图（DSG）作为JSON可序列化的表示，通过九角色MAS和双角色2AS分别构建和优化DSG。实验比较了两种LLM（Llama 3.3 70B和DeepSeek R1 70B）在不同配置下的表现。

Result: MAS在DSG粒度上优于2AS，但代码兼容性和需求覆盖率较低。DeepSeek R1 70B在任务完成率上表现更可靠。

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体系统能提升设计细节，但代码和需求方面仍需改进。推理蒸馏的LLM提高了任务完成率。

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Leanabell-Prover-V2是一个7B参数的大型语言模型，用于生成Lean 4中的形式化定理证明，通过验证器集成的长链思维（CoT）和强化学习（RL）优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Leanabell-Prover-V1的基础上，进一步改进模型性能，通过验证器反馈使模型能够自我感知推理的正确性并纠正错误。

Method: 采用验证器反馈的RL训练，结合反馈令牌掩码和简单奖励策略，优化多轮验证器交互的推理轨迹。

Result: 在MiniF2F测试集上，性能分别提升了3.2%（Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B）和2.0%（DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B）。

Conclusion: Leanabell-Prover-V2通过验证器反馈和RL优化显著提升了定理证明的性能，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

*Haoran Sun,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为INoT的新型AI代理推理框架，通过设计LLM可读的提示代码，减少推理成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理依赖LLMs和MLLMs，但受限于其固有缺陷（如自然语言理解不足）和高推理成本。

Method: 设计了INoT框架，通过LLM可读的提示代码实现程序化对话推理，使自我否定和反思在LLM内部完成。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，INoT平均性能提升7.95%，推理成本降低58.3%。

Conclusion: INoT在性能和成本上均优于基线方法，并展示了其在图像任务中的通用性。

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

setup requirements. We provide a novel GUI that allows a user to provide text
input for an LLM to generate instructions which it can then self-complete.
Empirical results indicate that these instructions \textit{can} improve a
reinforcement learning agent's performance. Therefore, we present this work to
accelerate the evaluation of language solutions on reward based environments to
enable new opportunities for scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在农业领域表现不佳，需提升其在精准农业中的可靠性。

Method: 采用提示专家评估协议和余弦一致性自投票机制，结合领域适配嵌入生成诊断。

Result: 玉米叶病识别准确率从82.2%提升至87.8%，症状分析和治疗建议也有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源受限环境中具有实际应用潜力，支持实时农业决策。

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估文本到图像模型的新框架，重点关注其对提示的遵循能力，并揭示了这些模型在生成简单图像时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态LLM和文本到图像模型的研究相对较少，其可靠性和性能评估不足，因此需要建立全面的评估框架。

Method: 创建了一个新数据集，利用GPT-4生成文本描述作为基准，通过文本到图像模型生成图像，再通过GPT-4评估生成图像与提示的差异。

Result: 模型在生成仅包含两个变化因素的简单二进制图像时表现不佳，且无法遵循输入数据集的分布。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型在遵循提示和生成特定分布图像方面存在显著挑战，需进一步优化。

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

Motivation: 旨在评估LLM在无需专门训练的情况下，通过不同提示策略完成复杂驾驶场景判断任务的潜力。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和多样本提示策略，以人类标注为基准，评估模型性能，使用精确率、召回率和F1分数作为指标。

Result: 提示设计显著影响性能，多样本提示下交叉口可见性召回率从21.7%提升至57.0%，交通密度一致性从53.5%增至67.6%。停车标志检测精确率高（86.3%），但召回率较低（76.7%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过优化提示设计，LLM有望成为驾驶风险评估的支持工具，未来需进一步探索更大数据集和下一代模型架构的扩展性。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CNTLoRA的数据驱动权重初始化方法，用于改进LoRA微调的收敛性和性能。该方法通过预训练权重和微调激活向量的闭式估计初始化LoRA权重，无需训练，并在下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA权重矩阵随机初始化且固定秩，限制了微调的性能和收敛速度。本文旨在通过数据驱动的方法改进初始化过程。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为域偏移问题，利用预训练和微调激活的约束关系，推导出闭式权重估计，并支持可变秩初始化。

Result: 在图像生成、分类和理解任务中，CNTLoRA优于标准和数据驱动的初始化方法，定量和定性结果均验证其优越性。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA提供了一种无需训练的初始化方法，显著提升LoRA微调的性能和收敛速度，并通过分析验证了其设计选择的合理性。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效且适应性强的图像分类方法，特别适用于无人机应用。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RALU的训练免费框架，通过空间维度加速扩散变换器的推理，显著减少计算量，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在高保真图像和视频生成中表现出色，但计算量大阻碍了实际应用。现有加速方法主要利用时间维度，而RALU则从空间维度入手。

Method: RALU通过三个阶段实现混合分辨率采样：低分辨率去噪、区域自适应上采样和全分辨率细节细化，并结合噪声时间步重调度以稳定生成。

Result: RALU在FLUX上实现了7.0倍加速，在Stable Diffusion 3上实现了3.0倍加速，且图像质量下降最小。

Conclusion: RALU是一种高效的加速方法，可与现有时间维度加速技术互补，进一步降低推理延迟而不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率SAR图像在建筑物高度估计中的准确性对城市应用至关重要，但现有方法在跨城市和跨大陆泛化能力上存在不足。

Method: 采用基于边界框检测的深度学习回归方法，使用多大陆数据集进行训练和交叉验证，评估其OOD泛化能力。

Result: 模型在欧洲城市表现最佳（MAE约2.20米），显著优于现有方法，但在亚洲高密度城市泛化能力有所下降。

Conclusion: 研究表明深度学习在单幅VHR SAR图像的跨城市和跨大陆建筑物高度估计中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS提出了一种基于3D高斯配准的框架，用于重建无姿态稀疏视图，通过熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法和联合配准模块，实现了高精度的相机姿态估计和场景对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化和前馈高斯方法在稀疏视图重建中存在局限性，RegGS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法计算最优传输距离，结合光度一致性和深度几何设计联合配准模块。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上验证了RegGS的高保真配准能力，实现了精确的相机姿态估计和新视角合成。

Conclusion: RegGS为稀疏视图重建提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新框架，从单目视频中重建动态人-物交互，解决遮挡和时间不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建方法假设静态物体或完全可见动态主体，在遮挡场景中性能下降。

Method: 利用模态补全推断部分遮挡区域的完整结构，结合时间上下文增强重建的连贯性。

Result: 在单目视频上验证，显示处理遮挡和时间稳定性优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架无需模板，适应性强，显著提升动态场景细节恢复能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

Result: 系统实现了轻量化的实时深度估计和物体检测，mAP50达到0.801。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效帮助视障人士避开障碍物，提升出行安全性。

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

Conclusion: 该方法为对抗样本提供了可证明的认证，扩展了自适应随机平滑分析的应用。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HNOSeg-XS是一种基于Hartley变换和可学习偏微分方程的医学图像分割架构，解决了CNN和Transformer在长距离空间相关性和计算效率上的不足，具有分辨率鲁棒性、高效性和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中因计算和内存限制导致的输入尺寸缩减问题，以及由此产生的次优结果。

Method: 通过傅里叶神经算子建模可学习偏微分方程，利用Hartley变换在频域中重新表述问题，构建HNOSeg-XS模型。

Result: 在BraTS'23、KiTS'23和MVSeg'23数据集上表现优异，参数少于34.7k，推理时间<0.24秒，内存占用<1.8 GiB。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS在分辨率鲁棒性、速度和内存效率上优于CNN和Transformer模型。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

Method: 修改StarDist-3D架构，使用闭合表面（如双三次Bézier三角形）表示实例，实现高分辨率预测。

Result: 在生物医学成像中，SurfDist表现优于StarDist-3D，实例参数化更紧凑。

Conclusion: 可解释的实例表面模型可以与实例成员关系一起有效学习。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in

for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this

Conclusion: 智能手机视频可作为低负担工具捕获有临床意义的生物力学数据，为监测运动障碍提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

Conclusion: CR-Net通过保留域内结构和提高判别能力，显著提升了跨分辨率适应能力。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过消除辅助线索，显著提升了生成模型的解释性和组合性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单一癌症类型，忽视了跨癌症泛化的挑战，而临床实践中需要模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出了SDIR模块（通过稀疏化和稳定化增强弱模态信号）和CADE模块（通过潜在空间融合局部形态和全局基因表达）。

Result: 在四种癌症类型的基准测试中表现出优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且鲁棒的基础。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有深度隐写方案因大载荷和单一范围特征提取易被隐写分析器检测，需改进以提升隐蔽性。

Method: 结合卷积的局部范围和Transformer的全局范围特性，输入多粒度频率分解图像，设计角度-范数解耦损失约束生成隐写图像。

Result: MRAG在实验中表现优异，实现了先进的性能。

Conclusion: MRAG通过多范围表示和对抗性扰动，显著提升了隐写图像的隐蔽性和恢复能力。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖任务特定架构和领域微调，而PanMatch旨在通过统一的位移估计框架实现多任务集成。

Method: 提出基于大型视觉模型的特征提取器和转换管道，构建跨领域数据集（180万样本）预训练模型。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，在异常场景（如雨天和卫星图像）中表现优异。

Conclusion: PanMatch展示了通用模型在多任务和零样本场景中的潜力，为鲁棒匹配提供了新思路。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖数据无关算法生成哈希中心，忽略了类间语义关系，可能降低检索性能。SHC旨在通过语义哈希中心保留语义结构。

Method: 1. 使用分类网络识别类间语义相似性；2. 优化算法生成语义哈希中心；3. 训练深度哈希网络生成二进制哈希码。

Result: SHC在多个公共数据集上显著优于现有方法，MAP@100、MAP@1000和MAP@ALL分别平均提升7.26%、7.62%和11.71%。

Conclusion: SHC通过语义哈希中心有效提升检索性能，验证了语义关系对哈希码生成的重要性。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出Cycle Context Verification (CCV)框架，通过自验证预测和增强上下文对齐，提升基于ICL的医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ICL在医学图像分割中因上下文对齐不足和标注数据稀缺导致的性能问题。

Method: 采用循环流程，通过交换查询图像和上下文图像-掩码对角色，自验证预测并优化对齐。

Result: 在七个数据集上验证，CCV优于现有方法，提升ICL分割性能。

Conclusion: CCV为通用医学图像分割提供了一种鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

synthetic datasets in enabling objective evaluation. Finally, we identify key

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像质量和下游任务（分类、检测、语义分割）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GEFU和SCUF方法有效提升了低光视觉任务的泛化能力和扩展性。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: VFMTok展示了在预训练视觉基础模型上构建高效图像分词器的可行性，为图像生成领域提供了新的工具和思路。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的3D重建具有广阔应用前景，未来需进一步解决精度、扩展性和动态场景适应性问题。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: CoDi实现了视觉感知和性能的双重提升，代码已开源。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Motivation: 解决提示学习中类嵌入分布建模不足和跨模态对齐局限于输出层的问题，以提升模型在新类别上的泛化能力和多模态空间的一致性。

Conclusion: MuGCP通过条件提示生成和多模态交互，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaScene提出了一种新的3D感知范式，旨在分解复杂场景中的实例并实现完整重建。通过空间对比学习和原位生成技术，显著提升了分解精度和对象完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能自然识别并补全遮挡物体，但机器人缺乏类似能力。现有技术将场景视为整体，无法从部分观察中识别完整对象。

Method: 开发空间对比学习以增强语义监督，并引入原位生成技术，利用观测和几何线索指导3D生成模型。

Result: 在复杂场景分解和对象补全实验中，方法表现出优越的分解精度和几何完整性。

Conclusion: InstaScene为复杂场景的3D感知提供了有效解决方案，实现了高精度的实例分解和完整重建。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

*Ji Hyun Seo,Byounhyun Yoo,Gerard Jounghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于参考视图的3D场景修复方法，通过调整其他视图的贡献以匹配参考视图，提高了修复结果的几何保真度和外观一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景修复方法因多视图不一致导致修复结果不自然，需一种能保持感知一致性的新方法。

Method: 利用参考视图的修复结果，估计其他视图的修复相似性，构建准确几何并引导优化以匹配参考外观。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了修复场景的几何保真度和外观一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景中也能生成真实且感知一致的修复结果。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadiomicsRetrieval是一个基于3D内容的医学图像检索框架，结合手工放射组学特征和深度学习嵌入，支持灵活查询，提升临床决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完整标注查询，限制了临床灵活性。

Method: 提出RadiomicsRetrieval框架，利用可提示分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性图像嵌入，并通过对比学习与放射组学特征对齐，辅以解剖位置嵌入（APE）增强表示。

Result: 在肺CT和脑MRI数据集上的实验表明，放射组学特征显著提升检索特异性，APE为基于位置的搜索提供全局解剖背景。

Conclusion: 该框架仅需最小用户提示（如单点），支持灵活查询，适用于诊断、治疗规划和大规模医学影像研究。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice
Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET
2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a
versatile, scalable solution bridging the gap between deep learning research
and practical clinical deployment.

Method: 提出D2Dewarp模型，感知水平和垂直维度的变形趋势，设计基于X和Y坐标的特征融合模块。利用自动标注方法构建新数据集。

Result: 在公开的中英文基准测试中，定量和定性结果均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: D2Dewarp通过双维度感知和特征融合，显著提升了文档去扭曲效果，并提供了新数据集支持。

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

Motivation: 研究如何通过最小化训练数据和标注工作量，优化DAN在手写文档转录中的表现。

Method: 使用两种标注策略（标准化标注和外交标注）在相同图像数据集上微调DAN，并比较其效果。

Result: 标准化标注适用于可标准化字段（如日期和出生地），而外交标注在不可标准化字段（如姓名和姓氏）上表现更优。

Conclusion: 不同标注策略适用于不同类型的字段，需根据字段特性选择合适的标注方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

Result: OGFR能够有效学习鲁棒特征表示，不受遮挡干扰。

Conclusion: OGFR通过遮挡引导的特征净化和知识蒸馏，显著提升了遮挡行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动收集和标注图像数据集耗时且低效，而AI生成的数据不如真实数据有价值。

Method: 通过协调四个配备多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的智能体及图像优化工具包，按用户需求构建数据集。

Result: 在扩展现有数据集和从头创建新数据集的实验中，DatasetAgent构建的数据集成功用于训练多种视觉模型。

Conclusion: DatasetAgent能高效构建高质量真实图像数据集，为视觉任务提供支持。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Result: 在过拟合设置下，性能提升超过现有启发式方法的三倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习是内存控制的有效替代方案，揭示了内存银行的未开发潜力。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

Motivation: 由于真实世界数据标注困难，现有方法通过GAN进行图像翻译但无法保证语义匹配，影响语义分割性能。

Method: DA-KPN通过估计像素级输入变换参数，结合多尺度判别器确保翻译的逼真性。

Result: 在合成到真实数据的语义分割任务中表现优于GAN方法，在人脸解析任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: DA-KPN在低数据量下实现了更好的语义匹配和分割性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

Conclusion: MoSAiC为多模态卫星图像提供了更精细的语义解耦和更鲁棒的表征学习。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法以体素为基本交互单元，限制了类别级信息的利用，影响补全结果的粒度。

Method: 提出DISC方法，使用类别查询替代体素查询，设计专用解码模块以优化类别级信息流。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中达到SOTA性能，mIoU分别为17.35和20.55。

Conclusion: DISC通过分离优化实例和场景类别，显著提升性能，尤其在实例类别上表现突出。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

TL;DR: 论文提出BayesTTA方法，解决视觉语言模型在时间演化分布偏移下的持续测试时适应问题，通过贝叶斯框架实现时间一致性预测和动态视觉表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续测试时适应方法在处理时间演化分布偏移时存在缺陷，如记忆限制、熵置信度不可靠和静态视觉表示不匹配。

Method: BayesTTA通过增量估计类条件高斯混合分布、自适应选择协方差结构和校准推理，动态对齐视觉表示。

Result: 在四个时间演化数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上，BayesTTA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BayesTTA有效解决了时间演化分布偏移下的持续适应问题，具有高效性和稳定性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms

*Junho Koh,Youngwoo Lee,Jungho Kim,Dongyoung Lee,Jun Won Choi*

TL;DR: OnlineBEV提出了一种基于循环结构的时间3D感知方法，通过MBFNet实现BEV特征的时间对齐，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多帧BEV特征的时间聚合性能受限于动态物体运动，需要更有效的方法对齐特征。

Method: 使用循环结构结合BEV特征，MBFNet提取运动特征并动态对齐历史与当前特征，采用Temporal Consistency Learning Loss显式对齐。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，性能优于当前最佳方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV通过时间特征对齐显著提升了相机3D感知性能，成为当前最优方法。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

TL;DR: Geo-ORBIT框架结合实时车道检测、数字孪生同步和联邦元学习，解决了交通数字孪生中的隐私、通信和计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态地图或昂贵传感器，限制了可扩展性和适应性，且大规模数字孪生面临隐私和效率挑战。

Method: 提出Geo-ORBIT框架，包括轻量级车道检测模型GeoLane、个性化检测的Meta-GeoLane和联邦学习的FedMeta-GeoLane。

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane在几何误差和泛化能力上优于基线方法，显著减少通信开销。

Conclusion: 该框架为灵活、情境感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

*Zach Eidex,Mojtaba Safari,Tonghe Wang,Vanessa Wildman,David S. Yu,Hui Mao,Erik Middlebrooks,Aparna Kesewala,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型（7T-Restormer），用于从常规1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，解决了7T MRI成本高、稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI虽然分辨率高，但成本昂贵且稀缺，且易产生伪影。通过合成7T质量的图像，可以使其更广泛应用于临床。

Method: 使用141例患者数据（1.5T和3T T1W MRI与7T T1图配对），训练7T-Restormer模型，并与ResViT和ResShift模型对比。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现优异，PSNR和SSIM显著优于其他模型，且参数更少。混合训练策略优于单一训练。

Conclusion: 7T-Restormer能高效合成7T质量的T1图，为临床工作流程提供了更便捷的高质量MRI解决方案。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

*Juntong Fan,Zhiwei Hao,Jianqiang Shen,Shang-Ling Jui,Yi Zhang,Jing-Xiao Liao,Feng-Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Birkhoff是一种新型的无数据压缩算法，专为Segment Anything Model（SAM）及其变体设计，具有高效、通用和紧凑的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在零样本分割中的优异表现，压缩这些模型成为迫切需求。

Method: Birkhoff采用Hyper-Compression算法和HyperLinear操作符，将高维参数向量压缩为低维标量，并加速推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Birkhoff在压缩时间、压缩比、性能和推理速度上表现优异，例如在SAM2-B上实现5.17x压缩比且性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、通用的压缩方法，适用于SAM及其变体，无需微调数据即可快速完成压缩。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Motivation: 现有的MLLMs在空间推理和基础任务中表现不足，容易产生幻觉，需要一种无需修改模型参数的方法来提升性能。

Method: ByDeWay利用单目深度估计将场景分为近、中、远三层，生成区域特定描述，并将这些深度感知的描述附加到图像-问题提示中。

Result: 在POPE和GQA基准测试中，ByDeWay显著减少了幻觉并提升了推理能力，适用于多种MLLMs。

Conclusion: ByDeWay证明了深度感知提示在零训练设置中的有效性，是一种轻量级、模块化的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

Result: 模型在10,000张MNIST测试图像上达到99.2%的准确率，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 深度特征提取和足够的原型覆盖对高性能至关重要，该方法在模式识别中有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user

response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.
NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

Motivation: 现有CNN方法计算成本高、泛化能力有限且可解释性差，需要改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为肌肉分割提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

Motivation: 现有自回归视频生成器存在架构不一致、依赖外部文本编码器或高延迟问题，Lumos-1旨在保留标准LLM架构并提升性能。

Method: 采用3D RoPE（MM-RoPE）增强时空相关性，提出AR-DF策略解决帧间损失不平衡问题，并优化训练效率。

Result: 在48个GPU上预训练后，Lumos-1在多个基准测试中表现与EMU3、COSMOS-Video2World和OpenSoraPlan相当。

Conclusion: Lumos-1通过改进的架构和训练策略，实现了高效且高质量的自回归视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

Motivation: 旨在通过压缩和蒸馏CLIP模型，减少计算资源和时间，同时保持多模态对齐能力。

Method: 采用权重复用和矩阵分解技术压缩模型，设计多模态相似性调节器（SR）损失进行蒸馏。

Result: L-CLIP在减少计算资源的同时，保持了与原始CLIP相当的多模态对齐能力。

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore在评估字幕质量和训练字幕模型时高效有效，但需与n-gram指标结合使用以避免训练失败。

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

Result: 在多个数字病理数据集上，SGPMIL在包级和实例级评估中均表现优异，且训练更快。

Conclusion: SGPMIL不仅保持了包级性能，还显著提升了实例级预测的质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉任务中常面临训练数据不足的问题，需要一种有效的方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 利用STV特征构建弱学习器集成，STV特征与总变分的非线性特征函数相关，能有效表征多尺度纹理。

Result: 在医学影像任务中，STV学习器（AUC=0.87）优于神经网络（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics（AUC=0.79）。

Conclusion: STV特征集成方法在数据不足时表现优异，尤其在CT图像中精细尺度特征对PET高摄取预测具有显著指示作用。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

TL;DR: 论文提出HieraRS方法，解决现有深度学习在分层土地覆盖和土地利用（LCLU）分类中的局限性，支持多粒度预测和跨域任务迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为平面分类，无法生成多粒度分层预测，且跨域研究忽视异构层次结构的迁移问题。

Method: 提出HieraRS范式，包含BHCCM机制和TransLU框架，支持动态类别扩展和语义对齐。

Result: 构建MM-5B数据集，方法提升了语义一致性和分类精度。

Conclusion: HieraRS增强了LCLU模型的灵活性和泛化能力，适用于异构层次结构的跨域任务。

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

TL;DR: CoPart提出了一种基于部分感知的扩散框架，通过分解3D对象为部分潜在表示，解决了现有方法在复杂几何和多部分关系建模上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成方法在捕捉复杂多部分几何、部分独立性及细粒度控制方面存在局限性，受人类3D设计工作流启发，提出了CoPart框架。

Method: CoPart将3D对象分解为部分潜在表示，支持部分关系建模和条件控制，并开发了联合部分潜在去噪的互指导策略。

Result: 实验表明，CoPart在部分级编辑、关节对象生成和场景组合方面表现出色，具有前所未有的可控性。

Conclusion: CoPart通过部分感知的扩散框架，显著提升了3D生成的细节保留和多部分关系建模能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于压缩光场令牌（CLiFTs）的神经渲染方法，通过压缩令牌高效渲染场景，并支持动态调整令牌数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统渲染方法在数据压缩、渲染质量和速度之间的权衡问题。

Method: 使用多视图编码器将图像和相机姿态转换为令牌，通过K-means聚类选择代表性光线，构建CLiFTs。测试时根据计算预算动态选择令牌生成新视图。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV数据集上验证，实现了显著数据压缩和高质量渲染，综合评分最高。

Conclusion: CLiFTs方法在数据大小、渲染质量和速度之间提供了灵活的权衡，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示的文本到语音模型在控制语音特征时存在局限性，且输入相同会导致不可控的输出变化。论文旨在通过利用模型的不可控变化，提高模型的可控性。

Method: 通过主成分分析（PCA）从数千个合成样本中提取潜在特征，并将其作为新标签用于二次微调。

Result: 在未包含情感披露的冰岛语语音模型上，该方法成功提取了连续和离散特征，显著提升了模型的可控性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效解决了基于提示的文本到语音模型的不可控变化问题，提高了模型的可控性和灵活性。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Method: 提出MedicalBERT，基于BERT架构，使用大规模生物医学数据预训练，并优化领域词汇和任务微调。

Result: MedicalBERT在多项任务（如命名实体识别、关系抽取）上优于BioBERT、SciBERT等，平均性能提升5.67%。

Conclusion: MedicalBERT证明了预训练BERT模型在生物医学NLP中的潜力，强调了迁移学习在领域适应中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits
domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and
bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5,
despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional
understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a
pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with
domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical
terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address
diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question
answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics
such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase
the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as
BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost
of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on
average across all the tasks evaluated respectively. This work alsounderscores

Motivation: 理解越狱攻击的复杂性和演变对AI安全至关重要。

Method: 通过分析200多万条真实对话，使用多种复杂度指标（如概率度量、词汇多样性、压缩比和认知负荷指标）进行评估。

Result: 越狱攻击的复杂度与正常对话相似，攻击毒性稳定，防御机制在改进。复杂度分布未呈现幂律特征，表明存在自然限制。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了攻防升级的叙事，指出AI安全受限于人类创造力，同时强调学术披露可能带来信息风险。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

Motivation: 评估FinGPT在金融领域NLP任务中的实际能力，为未来研究提供基准。

Method: 在六个金融NLP任务上测试FinGPT，使用金融专用数据集，并与GPT-4和人类基准对比。

Result: FinGPT在分类任务中表现强劲，但在推理和生成任务中性能显著不足。

Conclusion: FinGPT适用于结构化金融任务，但需进一步优化以提升复杂推理能力。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

Motivation: 挑战LLMs仅依赖表面统计数据的观点，探索其内部结构与人类理解的相似性。

Method: 提出三层次机器理解框架：概念理解、世界状态理解和原则理解，并结合机制可解释性（MI）的研究成果。

Result: LLMs确实形成了功能上类似于人类理解的结构，但其认知架构与人类不同。

Conclusion: 应将讨论焦点从LLMs是否理解转向其独特认知机制的工作原理。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

Motivation: 解决迭代文本生成中模型高效识别和修正自身错误的问题。

Result: 通过针对性优化，模型能更高效地改进生成文本的特定部分，提升最终输出质量。

Conclusion: R3是一种简单有效的框架，适用于预训练模型，显著提升文本生成质量。

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

Conclusion: LLMs在详细提示下可提供可解释模式，但与人类判断差异显著，需谨慎部署于自动化招聘。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

Motivation: LLMs的开放性带来了安全风险，尤其是嵌入空间中毒攻击，现有研究对此理解不足。

Method: 提出ETTA框架，通过线性变换在嵌入空间操作，无需微调或训练数据。

Result: 在五个开源LLMs上测试，平均攻击成功率达88.61%，优于基线11.34%。

Conclusion: 当前对齐策略存在关键漏洞，需开发嵌入感知的防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

Result: 模型普遍倾向自由主义价值观（如关怀与公平），微调进一步强化此倾向。

Conclusion: 自由主义倾向是训练数据的自然结果，可能反映集体理性，而非编程偏见。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

Conclusion: AI在招聘中能提升效率，但需注意其选择偏好可能带来的潜在影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成式AI模型在医学应用中的免责声明使用情况，以提醒用户AI输出未经专业审核，不能替代医疗建议。

Method: 使用500张乳腺X光片、500张胸部X光片、500张皮肤病图像和500个医学问题，筛选LLM和VLM输出中的免责声明短语。

Result: 免责声明在LLM和VLM输出中的比例从2022年的26.3%和2023年的19.6%分别降至2025年的0.97%和1.05%。

Conclusion: 随着AI模型能力的提升，免责声明需根据临床背景进行调整，以确保用户安全。

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了小型语言模型（SLMs）在心理健康理解任务中的表现，发现其性能接近大型语言模型（LLMs），尤其是在二元分类任务中，且通过少量样本学习（few-shot）能显著提升SLMs的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨SLMs作为隐私保护工具在敏感应用（如心理健康分析）中的潜力，并与LLMs进行比较。

Method: 采用零样本和少量样本学习范式，评估五种SLMs和三种LLMs在六项心理健康理解任务中的表现。

Result: SLMs在二元分类任务中表现接近LLMs（F1分数0.64 vs 0.66），在多分类任务中性能下降相似（30%以上）。少量样本学习对SLMs提升显著（14.6%）。

Conclusion: SLMs在心理健康理解任务中表现出色，适合作为隐私保护工具，尤其在少量样本学习下具有潜力。

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个框架，通过集成外部工具（如API、计算器等）增强大型语言模型（LLMs）在查询中的表现，特别是在教育场景中。实验结果显示其性能显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在缺乏上下文信息时可能生成低质量回答或幻觉内容，通过外部工具提供实时数据可提升准确性。

Method: 开发一个框架，允许访问外部API获取额外信息，并提供计算能力（如计算器、日历）。

Result: 在MMLU数据集上测试，数学推理准确率达83%，科学推理达88%，显著优于GPT-4o等基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建围绕LLMs的复杂计算生态系统铺平道路，使其更自然地支持多样化任务。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统回顾了68篇关于医学视觉问答（MedVQA）的文献，并调查了50名临床医生，发现MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际效用有限，主要问题包括数据集和模型的不足以及与临床需求的不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际效用，识别其挑战和差距，以促进其更好地整合到医疗实践中。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献综述和临床医生调查，分析MedVQA的现状和临床需求。

Result: 研究发现60%的问答对缺乏临床相关性，数据集和模型不支持多视图、多分辨率成像或电子病历集成。临床医生调查显示仅29.8%认为MedVQA高度有用。

Conclusion: MedVQA具有潜力，但需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏患者背景和评估方法不匹配等问题，以实现有效的临床整合。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设LLMs仅通过少样本提示即可生成有效计划，但实际能力不足，需改进。

Method: 引入CRISP数据集，自动生成并验证高层面计划，用于数学推理和代码生成。

Result: 微调小模型生成计划质量高于大模型少样本提示，且优于CoT推理，具有跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: CRISP验证了微调小模型在计划生成中的有效性，展示了跨领域泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

TL;DR: AblationBench是一个用于评估语言模型代理在AI研究中设计消融实验能力的基准套件，包含两个任务：AuthorAblation和ReviewerAblation。实验表明当前前沿语言模型在这些任务上表现有限，最佳系统仅识别29%的消融实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型代理在科研中的应用增加，设计消融实验成为AI研究的关键部分，需要评估代理在此任务上的能力。

Method: 提出AblationBench基准套件，包含AuthorAblation和ReviewerAblation两个任务，并开发基于语言模型的自动评估框架。

Result: 前沿语言模型在任务中表现有限，最佳系统仅识别29%的消融实验，且链式思维提示优于现有代理方法。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在消融实验设计任务上仍有挑战，链式思维提示显示出潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

*Junyi Wen,Junyuan Liang,Zicong Hong,Wuhui Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Krul动态选择KV缓存压缩策略，提升多轮对话中LLM的恢复效率，减少时间和存储开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法固定压缩策略，忽略对话间注意力模式的差异，导致准确性下降。

Method: 动态选择压缩策略、预选策略选择器、注意力相似性估计器和无气泡恢复调度器。

Result: TTFT减少1.5x-2.68x，KV缓存存储减少1.33x-2.35x，且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: Krul在多轮对话中高效且准确地恢复KV缓存，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从自然语言生成SPARQL查询的挑战，尤其是在零样本或少样本设置下，提升对多样化知识图谱的适应性。

Method: 利用大语言模型探索知识图谱，策略性执行SPARQL查询并搜索相关IRIs和字面量，无需微调。

Result: 在Wikidata上达到最先进水平，在Freebase上接近最佳少样本方法，其他知识图谱上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在零样本或少样本设置下表现优异，适用于多种知识图谱和基准测试。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型（LMs）的潜力巨大，但实际应用中存在安全、可解释性和偏见等问题，需要一种透明且可审计的方法来负责任地利用LMs。

Method: 提出一个框架，将LM驱动的子程序封装为可调用的函数，记录所有LM生成的工件（如提示、输入、输出和数据依赖），并支持在线优化。

Conclusion: 该框架为透明、可审计的LM应用提供了可行方案，适用于医疗、法律等多个领域。

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

TL;DR: Compactor是一种无需参数、与查询无关的KV缓存压缩策略，通过近似杠杆分数确定令牌重要性，显著减少内存负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文生成中KV缓存内存需求高的问题，降低部署成本和资源瓶颈。

Method: 使用近似杠杆分数进行令牌重要性评估，提出上下文校准压缩方法。

Result: 在合成和实际任务中保留一半令牌，内存负担减少63%，性能与竞争方法相当。

Conclusion: Compactor高效且通用，适用于多种任务和模型家族。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

Motivation: 在资源受限但需要频繁人机交互的场景（如智能手机）中，确保SLM保留LLM的共情能力至关重要。

Method: 采用两步微调过程，利用LLM生成的共情对话数据集，并设计四种针对性提示优化共情蒸馏。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了SLM的共情能力，为资源受限场景下的高质量人机交互提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

Result: 强模型普遍优于学生平均水平，弱模型可能偶然对齐；提示调整影响表现，但无模型-提示组合能全面匹配学生水平。

Conclusion: 需开发新训练和评估策略，并提供选择可行代理的指南。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM为LLM输出的真实性预测提供了全面且可扩展的工具，填补了现有工具包的不足。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像任务中表现优异，但在跨模态和跨语言的文档图像机器翻译任务中存在挑战，且传统微调方法会导致单语能力遗忘。

Method: 引入同步自检（SSR）范式，通过模型在生成翻译文本前先生成OCR文本，利用其单语OCR能力辅助跨语言翻译。

Result: 实验表明，SSR学习能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升模型在OCR和文档图像机器翻译任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR范式为多模态大语言模型在跨语言任务中的能力平衡提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT

*Atticus Wang,Joshua Engels,Oliver Clive-Griffin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，微调LLMs时，LoRA方法通过添加恒定转向向量实现OOCR，这种机制解释了LLMs在分布外任务中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在微调后表现出的OOCR现象，揭示其背后的机制。

Method: 通过LoRA微调方法分析OOCR，并训练转向向量验证其作用。

Result: 发现恒定转向向量足以解释OOCR，且在模型后门任务中同样适用。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的OOCR能力提供了一种解释，有助于理解其安全可靠部署。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究常忽略性别在疼痛体验中的作用，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用NLP和HAM-CNN模型对性别分类，并分析语言差异。

Result: F1分数为0.86，发现女性更情感化，某些疼痛症状在女性中更普遍。

Conclusion: 性别在疼痛体验中起重要作用，需在治疗中考虑性别差异。

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

TL;DR: Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT) 是一个开源的40B大型语言模型，旨在解决推理密集型任务中的过度思考问题，通过动态切换推理和非推理模式，显著减少token使用量，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理密集型任务中过度思考的问题，提高模型的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用自动思考训练范式，包括双机制数据集构建、多令牌预测增强的知识蒸馏、冷启动初始化策略以及Step-SRPO强化学习算法。

Result: KAT在多个基准测试中表现优异，token使用量减少约30%，并在实际应用中提高了开发效率。

Conclusion: KAT展示了AutoThink范式的可扩展性和高效性，未来有望通过更大规模的模型进一步提升性能。

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChainEdit框架结合知识图谱逻辑规则与LLM推理能力，系统性更新知识，提升逻辑一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM知识编辑方法在关联事实传播中难以保持逻辑一致性。

Method: 通过知识图谱提取逻辑规则，与LLM内部逻辑对齐，动态生成和编辑逻辑关联知识簇。

Result: 实验显示逻辑泛化能力提升30%以上，同时保持编辑可靠性和特异性。

Conclusion: ChainEdit在知识编辑中实现了逻辑一致性的新最优性能。

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

*Yinzhu Quan,Xinrui Li,Ying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRMAgent是一个基于大型语言模型的多代理系统，帮助商家生成高质量的消息模板和写作指导，通过三种模式提升营销效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商家在私人领域渠道（如即时通讯和电子邮件）中缺乏撰写有说服力内容的专业知识和工具，CRMAgent旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CRMAgent采用三种模式：基于群组的学习、检索与适应、基于规则的备用方案，以优化消息模板。

Result: 实验表明，CRMAgent在受众匹配和营销效果指标上显著优于商家原始模板。

Conclusion: CRMAgent为商家提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，提升了CRM活动的效果。

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的多智能体系统，用于模拟决策会议，重点检测参与者之间的共识。通过评估六种LLM在立场检测和立场极性检测任务中的表现，结果表明LLM能可靠检测动态辩论中的共识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策会议需要专家协作达成共识，但传统方法效率有限。LLM在模拟多智能体交互方面潜力巨大，因此探索其在决策会议模拟中的应用。

Method: 开发了基于LLM的多智能体系统，评估六种LLM在立场检测和立场极性检测任务中的表现，并测试其在复杂模拟中的有效性。

Result: LLM能可靠检测动态辩论中的共识，加入共识检测智能体可提升辩论效率和决策质量。

Conclusion: LLM多智能体系统能有效模拟群体决策过程，支持跨领域专家研讨会的决策支持。

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Result: 在三个领域中表现优异，自动评分领先，但在材料化学领域稍显不足。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程已能生成具有商业价值的创意，但某些领域需更深领域知识。

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

Motivation: 研究对比学习和知识蒸馏在训练跨编码器重排模型中的实际效果差异，为实践提供指导。

Method: 通过训练不同规模和架构的重排模型，使用对比学习和知识蒸馏方法，并以强对比学习模型作为教师模型进行实验。

Result: 知识蒸馏在教师模型较大时表现优于对比学习，但在教师模型容量相同时优势不明显，尤其是在跨领域任务中。

Conclusion: 建议在有大容量教师模型时使用知识蒸馏训练小模型，否则选择对比学习作为可靠替代。

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

Motivation: 系统探索如何充分发挥LLMs和RLLMs在金融领域的性能，填补相关研究的空白。

Method: 使用五种LLMs和三种RLLMs，评估提示方法、代理框架和多语言对齐方法的效果。

Result: 提示方法和代理框架通过模拟长链思维提升LLMs性能；RLLMs因固有长链思维能力，常规方法效果有限；多语言对齐方法主要通过延长推理长度提升LLMs的多语言性能。

Conclusion: 本研究为金融问答领域的LLMs和RLLMs提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估生成任务的自动n-gram指标（如ROUGE）在英语中表现良好，但在其他语言中的适用性尚不明确。本文通过多语言实验发现，n-gram指标在融合性语言中表现较差，而神经指标（如COMET）表现更优。

Motivation: 研究自动评估指标（n-gram和神经指标）在不同语言中的有效性，尤其是与人类评估的相关性。

Method: 设计大规模多语言评估套件，涵盖八种语言和四种语言类型，分析指标与人类评估的相关性。

Result: n-gram指标在融合性语言中表现较差，神经指标（如COMET）在低资源语言中表现更优。

Conclusion: n-gram指标在融合性语言中存在局限性，建议更多投资于神经指标的训练。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in

document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

Conclusion: 模型自身的可信判断可以作为提升生成文本事实性的有效信号。

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

integration are examined, which enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of
LLMs in discipline-specific contexts. From the perspective of their
applicability, this paper explores how LLMs are contributing to various
disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the
humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific
tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising
research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

### [136] [Using Large Language Models for Legal Decision-Making in Austrian Value-Added Tax Law: An Experimental Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08468)
*Marina Luketina,Andrea Benkel,Christoph G. Schuetz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在奥地利和欧盟增值税法律框架下辅助法律决策的能力，重点研究了微调和检索增强生成（RAG）两种方法的应用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在税务咨询实践中，客户常以自然语言描述案例，LLMs有望通过自动化决策支持减轻税务专业人员的工作负担。但由于法律领域对分析和论证的高要求，LLMs的幻觉倾向成为主要挑战。

Method: 研究通过微调和RAG方法，在教科书案例和实际税务咨询案例中测试LLMs的性能，以确定最佳配置并评估其法律推理能力。

Result: 研究发现，合理配置的LLMs能有效支持税务专业人员完成增值税任务并提供法律依据，但当前原型尚无法完全自动化，仍需处理隐式客户知识和特定背景文档的挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs在税务咨询中具有潜力，尤其是自动化常规任务和初步分析，但需进一步整合结构化背景信息以提升性能。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Conclusion: 该方法具有实际可行性和强大的应用潜力。

Abstract: The deep integration of large language models and automatic speech
recognition systems has become a promising research direction with high
practical value. To address the overfitting issue commonly observed in Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, this work
proposes an innovative training paradigm Iterative LoRA Training (ILT) in
combination with an Iterative Pseudo Labeling strategy, effectively enhancing
the theoretical upper bound of model performance. Based on Whisper-large-v3 and
Qwen2-Audio, we conduct systematic experiments using a three-stage training
process: Focus Training, Feed Back Training, and Fix Training. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the
MegaAIS research team applied this technique in the Interspeech 2025
Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Modeling Challenge (MLC-SLM),
achieving 4th in Track 1 (Multilingual ASR Task) and 1st place in Track 2
(Speech Separation and Recognition Task), showcasing the practical feasibility
and strong application potential of our approach.

Result: clembench已持续开发至2023年，最新版本优化了通用性，支持自定义评测扩展。

Conclusion: clembench为模型评测提供了灵活且可控的新范式，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在将非正式数学转化为机器可验证定理时，受限于多语言平行语料库的数量和质量。

Method: 提出KELPS框架，通过知识方程（KEs）将自然语言转化为多形式语言（如Lean、Coq和Isabelle），并定义严格规则确保结构和语义一致。

Result: 生成了超过60,000个问题的平行语料库，在MiniF2F上达到88.9%的语法准确率，优于Deepseek-V3和Herald。

Conclusion: KELPS框架在数学形式化任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了高质量的数据和工具。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are
available https://github.com/sunshibo1234/LLaPa.

Motivation: 研究如何通过结合LLM和LDA提升主题模型的效果，验证LLM在文本挖掘中的实际价值。

Method: 在LDA的初始化和后校正阶段引入LLM，通过实验评估LLM引导的初始化和后校正对模型性能的影响。

Result: LLM初始化对LDA早期迭代有改进，但对收敛无帮助且性能最差；LLM后校正提升了5.86%的一致性评估。

Conclusion: LLM在主题模型中的后校正阶段表现优异，但初始化效果不佳，挑战了LLM总是优于传统方法的观点。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Motivation: 现有知识图谱增强方法依赖参数密集型微调，易导致灾难性遗忘和泛化能力下降，且无法适应实时知识更新。

Method: 提出知识图谱引导注意力模块（KGA），包含外向聚合（动态融合外部知识）和内向聚合（过滤任务无关信号），形成闭环增强机制。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了KGA的优异知识融合性能，支持实时知识更新。

Conclusion: KGA框架无需参数更新即可动态融合知识，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

Conclusion: ASR生成的错误转录在说话人归属任务中表现优于人工转录，可能因其错误揭示了说话人身份特征。

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在推理任务中提升了模型的表现和推理结构。

Conclusion: 相比其他激活导向技术，缓存导向在参数稳定性、推理效率和易用性上更具优势，是一种更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

Method: 结合模拟、理论和机器人实验，分析噪声对交通流的影响，提出目标达成率的解析近似，并比较简单反应方案与中央规划器的性能。

Result: 高于临界噪声水平时，大型堵塞不会持续；简单反应方案在中等密度下表现良好且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 噪声运动可有效优化交通流，简单反应方案在现实问题中更具实用性。

Abstract: In crowded environments, individuals must navigate around other occupants to
reach their destinations. Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these
spaces is relevant to coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure
for dense populations. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and robotic
experiments to study how noisy motion can disrupt traffic jams and enable flow
as agents travel to individual goals. Above a critical noise level, large jams
do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the goal
attainment rate as a function of the noise level, then solve for the optimal
agent density and noise level that maximize the swarm's goal attainment rate.
We perform robotic experiments to corroborate our simulated and theoretical
results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a
sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive
scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally
efficient than a planner, suggesting lessons for real-world problems.

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is crucial for mobile robots' navigation in both known and
unknown environments. This research designs, trains, and tests two custom
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), using color and depth images from a depth
camera as inputs. Both networks adopt sensor fusion to produce an output: the
mobile robot's angular velocity, which serves as the robot's steering command.
A newly obtained visual dataset for navigation was collected in diverse
environments with varying lighting conditions and dynamic obstacles. During
data collection, a communication link was established over Wi-Fi between a
remote server and the robot, using Robot Operating System (ROS) topics.
Velocity commands were transmitted from the server to the robot, enabling
synchronized recording of visual data and the corresponding steering commands.
Various evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error, Variance Score, and
Feed-Forward time, provided a clear comparison between the two networks and
clarified which one to use for the application.

TL;DR: SelfReVision是一个轻量级、可扩展的自我改进框架，用于视觉语言程序规划，通过自我蒸馏提升小型VLMs的规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在机器人程序规划中表现良好，但缺乏低层次细节；视觉语言模型（VLMs）虽能提供更接地气的规划，但现有方法依赖昂贵的大模型或局限于仿真环境。

Method: SelfReVision通过自我批评、修订和验证的循环，无需外部监督或教师模型，提升小型VLMs的规划质量。

Result: 实验表明，SelfReVision显著提升了小型VLMs的性能，甚至优于规模大100倍的模型，并在下游任务中表现出更好的控制能力。

Conclusion: SelfReVision为轻量级VLMs提供了一种高效、可扩展的自我改进方法，适用于实际机器人任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in robotic procedural
planning, yet their human-centric reasoning often omits the low-level, grounded
details needed for robotic execution. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
path toward more perceptually grounded plans, but current methods either rely
on expensive, large-scale models or are constrained to narrow simulation
settings. We introduce SelfReVision, a lightweight and scalable
self-improvement framework for vision-language procedural planning.
SelfReVision enables small VLMs to iteratively critique, revise, and verify
their own plans-without external supervision or teacher models-drawing
inspiration from chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruct paradigms.
Through this self-distillation loop, models generate higher-quality,
execution-ready plans that can be used both at inference and for continued
fine-tuning. Using models varying from 3B to 72B, our results show that
SelfReVision not only boosts performance over weak base VLMs but also
outperforms models 100X the size, yielding improved control in downstream
embodied tasks.

Conclusion: CL3R通过结合3D和2D表示，解决了现有方法的局限性，为机器人操作提供了更鲁棒的感知模块。

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots show significant potential in daily tasks. However,
reinforcement learning-based motion policies often suffer from robustness
degradation due to the sim-to-real dynamics gap, thereby affecting the agility
of real robots. In this work, we propose a novel robust adversarial training
paradigm designed to enhance the robustness of humanoid motion policies in real
worlds. The paradigm introduces a learnable adversarial attack network that
precisely identifies vulnerabilities in motion policies and applies targeted
perturbations, forcing the motion policy to enhance its robustness against
perturbations through dynamic adversarial training. We conduct experiments on
the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for both perceptive locomotion and whole-body
control tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly
enhances the robot's motion robustness in real world environments, enabling
successful traversal of challenging terrains and highly agile whole-body
trajectory tracking.

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration between multiple LiDAR sensors and a
GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (GINS) is essential for achieving
reliable sensor fusion in intelligent mining environments. Such calibration
enables vehicle-road collaboration by aligning perception data from
vehicle-mounted sensors to a unified global reference frame. However, existing
methods often depend on artificial targets, overlapping fields of view, or
precise trajectory estimation, which are assumptions that may not hold in
practice. Moreover, the planar motion of mining vehicles leads to observability
issues that degrade calibration performance. This paper presents a targetless
extrinsic calibration method that aligns multiple onboard LiDAR sensors to the
GINS coordinate system without requiring overlapping sensor views or external
targets. The proposed approach introduces an observation model based on the
known installation height of the GINS unit to constrain unobservable
calibration parameters under planar motion. A joint optimization framework is
developed to refine both the extrinsic parameters and GINS trajectory by
integrating multiple constraints derived from geometric correspondences and
motion consistency. The proposed method is applicable to heterogeneous LiDAR
configurations, including both mechanical and solid-state sensors. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the accuracy,
robustness, and practical applicability of the approach under diverse sensor
setups.

Motivation: 现有SLAM方法在结构化环境中表现良好，但在极端情况下鲁棒性不足，且缺乏标准化评估和多传感器自适应融合策略。

Method: 1. 引入M3DGR数据集，包含多种传感器退化场景；2. 评估40种SLAM系统；3. 开发Ground-Fusion++框架，融合多种传感器。

Result: M3DGR数据集提供了系统性评估工具，Ground-Fusion++在复杂环境中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 论文填补了SLAM评估和自适应多传感器融合的空白，为未来研究提供了重要工具和方法。

Abstract: Considerable advancements have been achieved in SLAM methods tailored for
structured environments, yet their robustness under challenging corner cases
remains a critical limitation. Although multi-sensor fusion approaches
integrating diverse sensors have shown promising performance improvements, the
research community faces two key barriers: On one hand, the lack of
standardized and configurable benchmarks that systematically evaluate SLAM
algorithms under diverse degradation scenarios hinders comprehensive
performance assessment. While on the other hand, existing SLAM frameworks
primarily focus on fusing a limited set of sensor types, without effectively
addressing adaptive sensor selection strategies for varying environmental
conditions.
  To bridge these gaps, we make three key contributions: First, we introduce
M3DGR dataset: a sensor-rich benchmark with systematically induced degradation
patterns including visual challenge, LiDAR degeneracy, wheel slippage and GNSS
denial. Second, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of forty SLAM systems on
M3DGR, providing critical insights into their robustness and limitations under
challenging real-world conditions. Third, we develop a resilient modular
multi-sensor fusion framework named Ground-Fusion++, which demonstrates robust
performance by coupling GNSS, RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and
wheel odometry. Codes and datasets are publicly available.

Motivation: 卫星在动态和不确定环境中自主运行时，传统控制方法和现有DRL算法（如TD3、PPO、A2C）在实时适应性和容错性方面表现不足。

Method: 提出TD3-HD方法，整合TD3、HER和DWC，优化稀疏奖励环境下的学习效果，并在反应轮故障时保持稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，TD3-HD在姿态误差、角速度调节和故障条件下的稳定性方面显著优于传统PD控制和现有DRL算法。

Conclusion: TD3-HD是一种强大的、容错的机载AI解决方案，适用于自主卫星姿态控制。

Abstract: Reliable satellite attitude control is essential for the success of space
missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in
dynamic and uncertain environments. Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role
in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is
critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However,
traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall
short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for
autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control
strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault
conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and
Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in
sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures.
The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL
algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower
attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability
under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential
as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite
attitude control.

Motivation: LiDAR 3D建图在GNSS受限环境中存在累积漂移问题，导致全局错位，需要一种多传感器融合的方法来解决。

Method: 结合动态时间规整（DTW）进行速度对齐，使用扩展卡尔曼滤波优化GNSS和IMU数据，并通过NDT配准、位姿图优化和闭环检测构建局部地图，最后利用GNSS约束锚点和重叠段精细配准确保全局一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法及发布的数据集为GNSS受限环境下的3D城市建图设立了新基准。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D mapping suffers from cumulative drift causing global
misalignment, particularly in GNSS-constrained environments. To address this,
we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for
high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal
alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via
extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions
Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure
detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors
followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a
large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to
facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000
frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS
trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess
geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on
road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy.
Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m,
achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a
wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data
integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation. Our method,
and dataset together establish a new benchmark for evaluating 3D city mapping
in GNSS-constrained environments. The dataset and code will be released
publicly.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了仿真与现实末端执行器位置不一致的问题，提升了机器人操控的准确性。

Abstract: When inverse kinematics (IK) is adopted to control robotic arms in
manipulation tasks, there is often a discrepancy between the end effector (EE)
position of the robot model in the simulator and the physical EE in reality. In
most robotic scenarios with sim-to-real transfer, we have information about
joint positions in both simulation and reality, but the EE position is only
available in simulation. We developed a novel method to overcome this
difficulty based on haptic feedback calibration, using a touchscreen in front
of the robot that provides information on the EE position in the real
environment. During the calibration procedure, the robot touches specific
points on the screen, and the information is stored. In the next stage, we
build a transformation function from the data based on linear transformation
and neural networks that is capable of outputting all missing variables from
any partial input (simulated/real joint/EE position). Our results demonstrate
that a fully nonlinear neural network model performs best, significantly
reducing positioning errors.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了运动与臂部动作的冲突，实现了动态、速度感知的全身控制。

Abstract: Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy
has challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance,
efficient locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while
end-effector tracking may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability.
Additionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based
task specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector
velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address
these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic,
velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a
multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for
locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy
to resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a
twist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses
and motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation
and hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm.
The resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and
shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in
extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.

Conclusion: H2RH-SGS为人类-机器人交接任务提供了一种新的高效表示方法。

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires
a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although
training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual
domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.
Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new
directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this
paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot
handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or
real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot
Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate
robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera
mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in
the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.
We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects
and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in
both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot
handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective
representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

Abstract: Over the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in adopting deep
neural networks to enhance the performance of conventional reinforcement
learning. A notable milestone was the development of Deep Q-Networks (DQN),
which achieved human-level performance across a range of Atari games,
demonstrating the potential of deep learning to stabilise and scale
reinforcement learning. Subsequently, extensions to continuous control
algorithms paved the way for a new paradigm in control, one that has attracted
broader attention than any classical control approach in recent literature.
These developments also demonstrated strong potential for advancing
data-driven, model-free algorithms for control and for achieving higher levels
of autonomy. However, the application of these methods has remained largely
confined to simulated and gaming environments, with ongoing efforts to extend
them to real-world applications. Before such deployment can be realised, a
solid and quantitative understanding of their performance on applied control
problems is necessary. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of these
approaches on four diverse benchmark problems with implementation results. This
analysis offers a scrutinising and systematic evaluation to shed light on the
real-world capabilities and limitations of deep reinforcement learning methods
in applied control settings.

Conclusion: CDMI方法在机动检测中表现出高精度和高效性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient maneuver detection is critical for ensuring the safety
and predictability of spacecraft trajectories. This paper presents a novel
maneuver detection approach based on comparing the confidence levels associated
with the orbital state estimation and the observation likelihood. First, a
confidence-dominance maneuver indicator (CDMI) is proposed by setting a
confidence level for the state estimation and computing the maximum likelihood
of the observation and its confidence level. The CDMI then flag a maneuver when
the observation's confidence level exceeds that of the state estimation,
indicating that the observation is unlikely under the no-maneuver hypothesis
while maintaining consistency with the prior state estimation confidence. To
efficiently compute the maximum likelihood of the observation and obtain the
CDMI, a recursive polynomial optimization method is developed, taking advantage
of convex optimization and polynomial approximation. In addition, an integrated
CDMI approach is developed to eliminate the need to manually select the state
confidence level. The integrated CDMI approach maintains high detection
accuracy while simultaneously providing an indication of maneuver likelihood,
thereby enhancing robustness and practical applicability. The performance of
the proposed CDMI-based maneuver detection approaches is evaluated against an
optimal control distance metric and two mixture-based approaches. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed integrated CDMI approach can
achieve up to 99.33\% detection accuracy, at least 10% higher than the
competing methods, while substantially reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jets (APPJs) show significant potential for
biomedical applications, but their inherent complexity, characterized by
nonlinear dynamics and strong sensitivity to operating conditions like
tip-to-surface distance, presents considerable challenges for achieving robust
and reliable real-time control. To address these issues, this paper presents
the Neural Parameter-Varying Data-enabled Predictive Control (NPV-DeePC)
framework. By integrating hyper neural networks (hypernets) into the neural
Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) paradigm, the proposed method
adaptively captures system nonlinearities and parameter variations, updates the
neural feature space accordingly, and enables efficient and accurate trajectory
prediction and control. The NPV-DeePC framework is validated through extensive
simulations involving surface temperature tracking and thermal dose delivery.
The results highlight its ability to outperform existing controllers in terms
of accuracy and adaptability. The computational efficiency of the NPV-DeePC
approach makes it a viable candidate for real-time applications. These findings
underscore its potential to advance the safe and precise control of APPJs and
provide a scalable solution for other parameter-varying nonlinear systems.

Conclusion: HAPS赋能的vHetNets及其优化算法为下一代无线网络提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks (xG) must provide ubiquitous connectivity
while enhancing user experience in both densely populated urban areas and rural
regions. To achieve this, a disruptive network architecture is essential, and
high altitude platform stations (HAPS) offer a promising solution. By
integrating HAPS with terrestrial networks, we can create HAPS-empowered
vertical heterogeneous networks (vHetNets), which significantly improve
coverage and capacity, as well as support emerging use cases. In HAPS-empowered
vHetNets, different tiers can share the same spectrum, forming harmonized
spectrum vHetNets that enhance spectral efficiency (SE). However, we face two
major challenges: i) co-channel interference in harmonized spectrum vHetNets,
and ii) the large-scale nature of the network. To address the first challenge,
we adopt a cell-free approach as the underlying network architecture for the
HAPS-empowered vHetNet. In this approach, base stations use beamforming to
direct high-gain, narrow beams toward users, which helps mitigate interference.
However, this creates a nonconvex and high-dimensional optimization problem,
which highlights the second challenge of dealing with a large-scale network.
Consequently, centralized solutions become impractical due to the computational
and communication overhead involved. The standard two-block alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is one option, but nonconvex constraints
can hinder its convergence. As an alternative, we have developed a two-level
distributed proportional fairness beamforming weight design (PFBWD) algorithm.
This algorithm uses a combination of the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and
a three-block ADMM framework. The proposed method effectively tackles
nonconvexity, reduces complexity, and enables scalable, distributed
optimization with guaranteed convergence.

Abstract: Representation of inductive coupling lines with conventional static phasors
is the main reason of inadequacy of the existing phasors based simplified
stability analysis methods for microgrids with inductive coupling lines. In the
literature, dynamic phasors have been proposed for the dynamic modelling of
inductive lines to conserve the simplified structure of the analysis method. In
this study a generalized stability analysis method for LV AC microgrids,
composed of droop controlled inverters, is presented. The proposed analysis
method is based on the inclusion of dynamic phasors for inductive coupling
lines into the existing phasors based stability analysis method. The results
show that the stability analysis method with dynamic phasors successfully
predicts the instability boundaries of LV AC microgrids.

Abstract: The centerline of a bobsleigh track defines its geometry and is essential for
simulation modeling. To reduce bBobsleigh training costs, leveraging the
centerline of the bobsleigh track to construct a virtual environment that
closely replicates real competitive settings presents a promising solution.
However, publicly available centerline data are typically limited and it is
imprecise to construct a training system solely based on 2-dimensional (2D)
centerline. To address this practical issue, this paper proposes a method for
generating a 3-dimensional (3D) track centerline based on 2D centerline data.
Incorporating international track design regulations, the method formulates an
optimization problem that considers total track length, height difference,
slope constraints, and geometric continuity. A Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)
algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. The generated 3D
centerlines are compared with real track data, and the results show that the
method can reproduce realistic centerline trends from original or scaled 2D
data. For the selected track segment, the relative errors in total length,
height difference, and average slope are within 1.7%, 3.2% and 4.1%,
respectively, for real 2D data and within 1.1%, 3.5% and 4.3% respectively for
scaled data. All slope values remain within the allowable limits. Moreover, by
adjusting the segmentation or modifying the weight of height difference in the
cost function, various centerline styles applicable to different competitions
can be generated. Under different segmentation and weight factors, the maximum
errors reach up to 4.4%, 4.8%, and 9.8%, and 4.4%, 4.8%, and 10.0%,
respectively. The proposed method provides a flexible and efficient tool for
supporting bobsleigh track centerline design.

Abstract: The integration of PV systems and increased electrification levels present
significant challenges to the traditional design and operation of distribution
grids. This paper presents a methodology for extracting, validating, and
adapting grid data from a distribution system operator's (DSO) database to
facilitate large-scale grid studies, including load flow and optimal power flow
analyses. The validation process combines rule-based sanity checks and offline
automated power flow analyses to ensure data consistency and detect potential
errors in the grid database, allowing for their correction. As a practical
application, the paper proposes a method to assess the PV hosting capacity of
distribution grids, with a focus on ensuring fairness in their spatial
distribution. By incorporating fairness criteria into the analyses, we quantify
the costs (in terms of missed revenues from selling PV generation) associated
with spatial fairness.

Motivation: 传统森林资源调查方法耗时耗力，多光谱LiDAR技术能同时获取空间和光谱信息，提高森林组分分割的效率和精度。

Method: 使用HeliALS系统获取多光谱点云数据，采用三种点云深度学习模型和一种机器学习模型进行森林组分分割。

Abstract: Conservation and decision-making regarding forest resources necessitate
regular forest inventory. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in laser scanning
systems has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a remote
and non-destructive solution to streamline the labor-intensive and
time-consuming procedure of forest inventory. Advanced multispectral (MS) LiDAR
systems simultaneously acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial and spectral
information across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Consequently, MS-LiDAR technology enables the estimation of both the
biochemical and biophysical characteristics of forests. Forest component
segmentation is crucial for forest inventory. The synergistic use of spatial
and spectral laser information has proven to be beneficial for achieving
precise forest semantic segmentation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the
potential of MS-LiDAR data, captured by the HeliALS system, providing
high-density multispectral point clouds to segment forests into six components:
ground, low vegetation, trunks, branches, foliage, and woody debris. Three
point-wise 3D deep learning models and one machine learning model, including
kernel point convolution, superpoint transformer, point transformer V3, and
random forest, are implemented. Our experiments confirm the superior accuracy
of the KPConv model. Additionally, various geometric and spectral feature
vector scenarios are examined. The highest accuracy is achieved by feeding all
three wavelengths (1550 nm, 905 nm, and 532 nm) as the initial features into
the deep learning model, resulting in improvements of 33.73% and 32.35% in mean
intersection over union (mIoU) and in mean accuracy (mAcc), respectively. This
study highlights the excellent potential of multispectral LiDAR for improving
the accuracy in fully automated forest component segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIL方法依赖排列不变性，限制了其在WSI分析中捕捉实例间语义关联的能力。

Method: 提出一种基于Siamese网络的新方法，通过解决实例拼图问题（恢复随机打乱的实例顺序）来学习空间相关性。

Result: 在WSI分类和生存预测任务中，该方法优于现有MIL方法。

Conclusion: 通过打破排列不变性限制，新方法能更有效地捕捉实例间的语义关联，提升WSI分析性能。

Abstract: While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach
for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on
permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover
semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and
theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not
permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances
can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a
novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the
order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task
as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations
between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we
propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by
optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification
and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent
state-of-the-art MIL competitors. The code is available at
https://github.com/xiwenc1/MIL-JigsawPuzzles.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)的新方法，用于解决颅内颈动脉钙化(ICAC)的段特异性量化问题，通过并行概率地标定位任务实现高精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICAC总体积指标忽略了斑块位置的关键影响，而传统3D模型因技术限制无法实现段特异性量化。

Method: 将3D问题重新定义为1D轴向维度的并行概率地标定位任务，提出DST框架处理全分辨率CT体积，预测6个独立概率分布以定位关键解剖标志。

Result: 在100名患者的临床队列中，DST的MAE为0.1切片，96%预测在±1切片范围内；在Clean-CC-CCII基准测试中表现最佳。

Conclusion: DST是首个实用的自动化段特异性ICAC分析工具，为位置特异性生物标志物的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: While total intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) volume is an
established stroke biomarker, growing evidence shows this aggregate metric
ignores the critical influence of plaque location, since calcification in
different segments carries distinct prognostic and procedural risks. However, a
finer-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically
infeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or
isolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical
ambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we
reformulate the 3D challenge as a \textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark
Localization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the
\textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes
full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$
independent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks.
Our DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated
on a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \textbf{0.1 slices}, with \textbf{96\%}
of predictions falling within a $\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to
validate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result
on the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end
evaluation protocol. Our work delivers the first practical tool for automated
segment-specific ICAC analysis. The proposed framework provides a foundation
for further studies on the role of location-specific biomarkers in diagnosis,
prognosis, and procedural planning. Our code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: Raptor是一种高效且通用的方法，为医学体积深度学习提供了新基础。

Abstract: Current challenges in developing foundational models for volumetric imaging
data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), stem from the computational
complexity of training state-of-the-art architectures in high dimensions and
curating sufficiently large datasets of volumes. To address these challenges,
we introduce Raptor (Random Planar Tensor Reduction), a train-free method for
generating semantically rich embeddings for volumetric data. Raptor leverages a
frozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual
tokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes. These tokens are then
spatially compressed using random projections, significantly reducing
computational complexity while retaining semantic information. Extensive
experiments on ten diverse medical volume tasks verify the superior performance
of Raptor over state-of-the-art methods, including those pretrained exclusively
on medical volumes (+3% SuPreM, +6% MISFM, +10% Merlin, +13% VoCo, and +14%
SLIViT), while entirely bypassing the need for costly training. Our results
highlight the effectiveness and versatility of Raptor as a foundation for
advancing deep learning-based methods for medical volumes.

bracketing and computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS) by
simultaneously forming multiple spatially multiplexed projections with unique

subsequently processed through a deep reconstruction model to generate an HDR
image and a hyperspectral datacube. Our simulation studies show that the
proposed system achieves higher reconstruction accuracy than previous snapshot
hyperspectral imaging methods on benchmark datasets. We assemble a working
prototype and demonstrate snapshot reconstruction of 60 dB dynamic range and 10

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations increasingly require onboard
intelligence under strict power and communication constraints. This paper
proposes a neuromorphic split computing framework tailored for hierarchical LEO
systems, where edge satellites perform event-driven sensing using dynamic
vision sensors (DVS) and lightweight spiking neural network (SNN) encoders,
while core satellites conduct inference using a powerful SNN decoder. A learned
spike mapping scheme enables direct transmission over optical inter-satellite
links (OISLs) without conventional modulation overhead. Experimental results on
synthetic aerial scene classification demonstrate that the proposed
architecture achieves accuracy on par with modern large vision-based pipelines,
while offering energy efficiency comparable to that of existing lightweight
implementations. These findings highlight the potential of neuromorphic
computing for energy-efficient inter-satellite split computing in LEO remote
sensing missions.
