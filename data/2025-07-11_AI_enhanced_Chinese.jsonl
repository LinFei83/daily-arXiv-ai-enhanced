Online verification has emerged as a promising\napproach to monitor such systems at runtime, yet its integration into embedded\nreal-time environments remains limited. This work presents a safeguarding\nconcept for motion planning that extends prior approaches by introducing a time\nsafeguard. While existing methods focus on geometric and dynamic feasibility,\nour approach additionally monitors the temporal consistency of planning outputs\nto ensure timely system response. A prototypical implementation on a real-time\noperating system evaluates trajectory candidates using constraint-based\nfeasibility checks and cost-based plausibility metrics. Preliminary results\nshow that the safeguarding module operates within real-time bounds and\neffectively detects unsafe trajectories. However, the full integration of the\ntime safeguard logic and fallback strategies is ongoing. This study contributes\na modular and extensible framework for runtime trajectory verification and\nhighlights key aspects for deployment on automotive-grade hardware. Future work\nincludes completing the safeguarding logic and validating its effectiveness\nthrough hardware-in-the-loop simulations and vehicle-based testing.

For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,\nas a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of \"a yellow\nsubmarine and a blue bus\" or \"a blue submarine and a yellow bus\". Previous\nattempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the\narchitecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect\nthat the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in\nthe arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this\nwork, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data\nproperties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We\nfind that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,\nincomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to\ndescribe the object that is \"most salient\" to them have a detrimental effect on\nbinding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling\nthe batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly\ncreating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the\ndata expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect\nbinding.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLIP模型在视觉-语言任务中存在绑定问题，研究发现数据属性（如低属性密度、不完整标注和显著性偏差）是关键影响因素。", "motivation": "解决CLIP模型在区分复杂视觉场景时的绑定问题，探索数据属性对模型性能的影响。", "method": "使用合成数据集系统分析数据属性（如属性密度、标注完整性和显著性偏差）对CLIP绑定能力的影响。", "result": "发现数据属性（如高属性密度和完整标注）是CLIP学习可靠绑定的关键，而非批量大小或硬负样本。", "conclusion": "通过优化数据属性，可以显著提升CLIP模型的绑定能力。"}}

However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs\nbuilt on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2).
