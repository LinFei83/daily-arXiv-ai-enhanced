### [1] [Bootstrapping Human-Like Planning via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22604)
*David Porfirio,Vincent Hsiao,Morgan Fine-Morris,Leslie Smith,Laura M. Hiatt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何结合自然语言编程和拖拽界面，利用大语言模型生成人类类似的动作序列，并与手动指定的动作序列进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人终端用户需要更直观的任务指定方式，自然语言和拖拽界面各有优劣，研究旨在探索两者的结合效果。

Method: 构建基于大语言模型的流程，输入自然语言并输出类似人类动作序列，与手动指定的动作序列进行对比。

Result: 大模型在生成人类类似动作序列上表现更优，但小模型也能达到满意效果。

Conclusion: 结合自然语言和大语言模型的方法可行，大模型表现更优，但小模型仍有实用性。

Abstract: Robot end users increasingly require accessible means of specifying tasks for
robots to perform. Two common end-user programming paradigms include
drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming. Although natural
language interfaces harness an intuitive form of human communication,
drag-and-drop interfaces enable users to meticulously and precisely dictate the
key actions of the robot's task. In this paper, we investigate the degree to
which both approaches can be combined. Specifically, we construct a large
language model (LLM)-based pipeline that accepts natural language as input and
produces human-like action sequences as output, specified at a level of
granularity that a human would produce. We then compare these generated action
sequences to another dataset of hand-specified action sequences. Although our
results reveal that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in the
production of human-like action sequences, smaller models nonetheless achieve
satisfactory performance.

*Graham Todd,Alexander G. Padula,Dennis J. N. J. Soemers,Julian Togelius*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ludax是一个结合游戏描述语言和硬件加速的框架，旨在加速游戏研究，支持快速模拟和灵活表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为支持人工智能研究，特别是强化学习，需要一种能自动编译为硬件加速代码的游戏描述语言，以提高效率和通用性。

Method: 开发了Ludax框架，结合游戏描述语言的通用性和现代并行处理硬件的速度，并集成到深度学习流程中。

Result: Ludax提供了详细的描述语言和技术编译说明，通过速度基准测试和RL代理训练展示了其性能。

Conclusion: Ludax作为开源工具，有望加速从强化学习到认知科学的游戏研究。

Abstract: Games have long been used as benchmarks and testing environments for research
in artificial intelligence. A key step in supporting this research was the
development of game description languages: frameworks that compile
domain-specific code into playable and simulatable game environments, allowing
researchers to generalize their algorithms and approaches across multiple games
without having to manually implement each one. More recently, progress in
reinforcement learning (RL) has been largely driven by advances in hardware
acceleration. Libraries like JAX allow practitioners to take full advantage of
cutting-edge computing hardware, often speeding up training and testing by
orders of magnitude. Here, we present a synthesis of these strands of research:
a domain-specific language for board games which automatically compiles into
hardware-accelerated code. Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of
game description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing
hardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines.
We envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from
RL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible
representation scheme. We present a detailed breakdown of Ludax's description
language and technical notes on the compilation process, along with speed
benchmarking and a demonstration of training RL agents. The Ludax framework,
along with implementations of existing board games, is open-source and freely
available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have moved far beyond their initial form as
simple chatbots, now carrying out complex reasoning, planning, writing, coding,
and research tasks. These skills overlap significantly with those that human
scientists use day-to-day to solve complex problems that drive the cutting edge
of research. Using LLMs in "agentic" AI has the potential to revolutionize
modern science and remove bottlenecks to progress. In this work, we present
URSA, a scientific agent ecosystem for accelerating research tasks. URSA
consists of a set of modular agents and tools, including coupling to advanced
physics simulation codes, that can be combined to address scientific problems
of varied complexity and impact. This work highlights the architecture of URSA,
as well as examples that highlight the potential of the system.

### [4] [Explanations are a means to an end](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22740)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于统计决策理论的框架，强调解释性机器学习方法应针对具体用途设计和评估，避免模糊性，并通过理论和实证结合的方式评估解释的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解释性机器学习方法未充分考虑实际用途，导致解释可能被误用或效果不佳。

Method: 提出基于统计决策理论的框架，明确解释的具体用途，并通过理论和实证结合的方式评估解释的价值。

Result: 框架可应用于多种场景（如临床决策支持、提供补救措施或调试），并能量化解释对理想决策者性能的最大提升。

Conclusion: 解释性方法应针对具体用途设计，并通过明确用途和结合理论实证评估来提升其实际价值。

Abstract: Modern methods for explainable machine learning are designed to describe how
models map inputs to outputs--without deep consideration of how these
explanations will be used in practice. This paper argues that explanations
should be designed and evaluated with a specific end in mind. We describe how
to formalize this end in a framework based in statistical decision theory. We
show how this functionally-grounded approach can be applied across diverse use
cases, such as clinical decision support, providing recourse, or debugging. We
demonstrate its use to characterize the maximum "boost" in performance on a
particular task that an explanation could provide an idealized decision-maker,
preventing misuse due to ambiguity by forcing researchers to specify concrete
use cases that can be analyzed in light of models of expected explanation use.
We argue that evaluation should meld theoretical and empirical perspectives on
the value of explanation, and contribute definitions that span these
perspectives.

### [5] [Bridging Ethical Principles and Algorithmic Methods: An Alternative Approach for Assessing Trustworthiness in AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22774)
*Michael Papademas,Xenia Ziouvelou,Antonis Troumpoukis,Vangelis Karkaletsis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合伦理与算法的评估方法，旨在量化AI系统的可信度，弥补现有指南与技术工具的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI技术的广泛影响及其复杂性导致对其可信度的评估缺乏全面性与量化方法，亟需一种结合伦理与算法的框架。

Method: 结合Trustworthy AI的伦理组件与PageRank、TrustRank的算法流程，提出一种评估框架。

Result: 该方法通过量化指标与理论内容的结合，实现了对AI系统可信度的全面评估。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为AI可信度评估提供了更客观、全面的解决方案，兼具伦理与算法的优势。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges
posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into
society and exert significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and
their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial
risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The
complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead
to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or
understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and
guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools
aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view
of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness.
Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such
quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific
aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method
that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic
processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment
framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment
techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The
application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI
system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights
while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.

### [6] [ReasonBridge: Efficient Reasoning Transfer from Closed to Open-Source Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22865)
*Ziqi Zhong,Xunzhu Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReasonBridge通过层次知识蒸馏框架，将闭源模型的推理能力高效迁移到开源模型，显著缩小性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决闭源与开源模型在复杂推理任务中的性能差距问题。

Method: 采用层次蒸馏、稀疏适配器架构和测试时计算扩展机制，使用精心筛选的Reason1K数据集。

Result: 开源模型推理能力提升23%，Qwen2.5-14B在部分任务上超越闭源模型。

Conclusion: ReasonBridge为推理能力增强提供了一种样本高效的方法，适用于多种领域和架构。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed a
significant performance gap between closed-source and open-source models,
particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and precise instruction
following. This paper introduces ReasonBridge, a methodology that efficiently
transfers reasoning capabilities from powerful closed-source to open-source
models through a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. We
develop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning
traces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality. These traces are
filtered from across multiple domains using a structured multi-criteria
selection algorithm. Our transfer learning approach incorporates: (1) a
hierarchical distillation process capturing both strategic abstraction and
tactical implementation patterns, (2) a sparse reasoning-focused adapter
architecture requiring only 0.3% additional trainable parameters, and (3) a
test-time compute scaling mechanism using guided inference interventions.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ReasonBridge improves reasoning
capabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks,
significantly narrowing the gap with closed-source models. Notably, the
enhanced Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Claude-Sonnet3.5 on MATH500 and matches its
performance on competition-level AIME problems. Our methodology generalizes
effectively across diverse reasoning domains and model architectures,
establishing a sample-efficient approach to reasoning enhancement for
instruction following.

this paper, we take a closer look at the potential of AI for Enterprises, where
decision-making plays a crucial and repeated role across functions, tasks, and
operations. We consider Agents imbued with AI as means to increase
decision-productivity of enterprises. We highlight six tenets for Agentic
success in enterprises, by drawing attention to what the current, AI-Centric
User paradigm misses, in the face of persistent needs of and usefulness for
Enterprise Decision-Making. In underscoring a shift to User-Centric AI, we
offer six tenets and promote market mechanisms for platforms, aligning the
design of AI and its delivery by Agents to the cause of enterprise users.

### [8] [Hecto: Modular Sparse Experts for Adaptive and Interpretable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22919)
*Sanskar Pandey,Ruhaan Chopra,Saad Murtaza Bhat,Ark Abhyudaya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hecto是一种轻量级的混合专家（MoE）架构，通过结合GRU和FFNN专家实现异构计算，提升专业化和可解释性，在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型的专家依赖相同的归纳偏差，限制了表示多样性和计算效率，Hecto旨在通过异构架构解决这一问题。

Method: Hecto结合GRU专家（时间推理）和FFNN专家（静态抽象），采用稀疏Top-1门控机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Hecto性能接近或优于同质基线，专家表现出明确的专业化（时间vs静态推理）。

Conclusion: Hecto为条件计算提供了新基准，其异构架构在低资源场景中表现出稳定性和可解释性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing
inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive
biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation
pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and
limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE
architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU
expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a
sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG
News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely
trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input
representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert
aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch
sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed
computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize
more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the
source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning
tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional
computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in
low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled
specialization.

### [9] [Improving Rationality in the Reasoning Process of Language Models through Self-playing Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22920)
*Pinzheng Wang,Juntao Li,Zecheng Tang,Haijia Gui,Min zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过自玩的批评-辨别游戏（CDG）提升大语言模型（LLM）在推理过程中的理性能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在推理任务中表现优秀，但缺乏对其推理过程的真正理解。

Method: 设计CDG游戏，模型作为证明者提供解决方案，随后接受批评者的挑战，区分误导与建设性反馈。

Result: 实验表明，CDG训练显著提升了模型在数学推理、错误检测、自我修正和长链推理中的能力。

Conclusion: 自玩方法CDG能有效增强模型对推理过程的理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning
abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent
studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their
reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the
rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans
or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover
first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by
critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the
prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when
faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to
constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical
reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning
demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of
well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.

### [10] [MARBLE: A Hard Benchmark for Multimodal Spatial Reasoning and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22992)
*Yulun Jiang,Yekun Chai,Maria Brbić,Michael Moor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MARBLE是一个多模态推理基准测试，旨在评估多模态语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂多模态问题中的逐步推理能力。现有模型表现不佳，表明多模态推理仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准测试多局限于文本或简单多模态问题，复杂多模态推理能力尚未被充分研究。

Method: MARBLE包含两个高难度任务（M-Portal和M-Cube），要求模型在空间、视觉和物理约束下制定和理解多步计划。

Result: 12个先进模型在MARBLE上表现接近随机水平，M-Cube任务准确率为0%，表明现有模型在多模态推理上仍有不足。

Conclusion: MARBLE揭示了MLLMs的局限性，希望推动下一代具备多模态推理能力的模型发展。

Abstract: The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason
through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial
intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only
reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly
retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning
remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a
challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize
multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason
step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is
composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the
crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and
physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE --
all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0%
accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the
random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for
existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where
MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By
shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the
development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and
plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.

web search, and email. Its modular design allows easy integration of new tools
using natural language prompts and action classes. On VoiceBench, AURA scores
92.75% on OpenBookQA-outperforming all open-weight systems and nearing
GPT-4o-and 4.39 on AlpacaEval, competitive with other open-weight systems.
Human evaluation shows 90% task success on complex, multi-turn speech tasks.

*Xinmin Fang,Lingfeng Tao,Zhengxiong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个五阶段进化框架，用于理解人工智能的发展，认为其轨迹与人类认知技术的历史进展相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人工智能的发展路径，提供一个跨学科的系统模型，解释其过去的结构变化并指导未来方向。

Method: 通过类比人类认知技术的里程碑（如楔形文字、字母、逻辑等），构建了一个“认知几何”框架，分析AI的进化阶段。

Result: AI的进化不仅是线性的，还具有自反性，当前正进入“元语言时刻”，未来将迈向“数学符号时刻”和“形式逻辑系统时刻”。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来AI发展提供了理论基础和实用策略，是作者三部曲的方法论总结。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive five-stage evolutionary framework for
understanding the development of artificial intelligence, arguing that its
trajectory mirrors the historical progression of human cognitive technologies.
We posit that AI is advancing through distinct epochs, each defined by a
revolutionary shift in its capacity for representation and reasoning, analogous
to the inventions of cuneiform, the alphabet, grammar and logic, mathematical
calculus, and formal logical systems. This "Geometry of Cognition" framework
moves beyond mere metaphor to provide a systematic, cross-disciplinary model
that not only explains AI's past architectural shifts-from expert systems to
Transformers-but also charts a concrete and prescriptive path forward.
Crucially, we demonstrate that this evolution is not merely linear but
reflexive: as AI advances through these stages, the tools and insights it
develops create a feedback loop that fundamentally reshapes its own underlying
architecture. We are currently transitioning into a "Metalinguistic Moment,"
characterized by the emergence of self-reflective capabilities like
Chain-of-Thought prompting and Constitutional AI. The subsequent stages, the
"Mathematical Symbolism Moment" and the "Formal Logic System Moment," will be
defined by the development of a computable calculus of thought, likely through
neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis, culminating in provably
aligned and reliable AI that reconstructs its own foundational representations.
This work serves as the methodological capstone to our trilogy, which
previously explored the economic drivers ("why") and cognitive nature ("what")
of AI. Here, we address the "how," providing a theoretical foundation for
future research and offering concrete, actionable strategies for startups and
developers aiming to build the next generation of intelligent systems.

### [13] [Can Large Language Models Capture Human Risk Preferences? A Cross-Cultural Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23107)
*Bing Song,Jianing Liu,Sisi Jian,Chenyang Wu,Vinayak Dixit*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在模拟风险决策行为中的表现，发现模型比人类更规避风险，且中文提示下的预测偏差更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs应用的扩展，其在复杂决策行为（如风险决策）中的可靠性引发关注，本研究旨在评估其模拟能力。

Method: 通过彩票任务比较ChatGPT 4o和o1-mini的预测与人类实际选择，使用CRRA框架分析风险偏好，并考察多语言数据的影响。

Result: 模型比人类更规避风险，o1-mini更接近人类行为；中文提示下的预测偏差大于英文。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟人类风险行为方面具有潜力，但在语言和文化背景下的表现仍有局限。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides, extending their
applications to dialogue systems, automated content creation, and
domain-specific advisory tasks. However, as their use grows, concerns have
emerged regarding their reliability in simulating complex decision-making
behavior, such as risky decision-making, where a single choice can lead to
multiple outcomes. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate
risky decision-making scenarios. We compare model-generated decisions with
actual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation
stated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong,
and Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and
ChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk
preferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA)
framework. Results show that both models exhibit more risk-averse behavior than
human participants, with o1-mini aligning more closely with observed human
decisions. Further analysis of multilingual data from Nanjing and Hong Kong
indicates that model predictions in Chinese deviate more from actual responses
compared to English, suggesting that prompt language may influence simulation
performance. These findings highlight both the promise and the current
limitations of LLMs in replicating human-like risk behavior, particularly in
linguistic and cultural settings.

Conclusion: 通过建立科学基础和研究政策接口，论文为实现AI时代更好的社会效果做出了贡献。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is humanity's most promising technology because of
the remarkable capabilities offered by foundation models. Yet, the same
technology brings confusion and consternation: foundation models are poorly
understood and they may precipitate a wide array of harms. This dissertation
explains how technology and society coevolve in the age of AI, organized around
three themes. First, the conceptual framing: the capabilities, risks, and the
supply chain that grounds foundation models in the broader economy. Second, the
empirical insights that enrich the conceptual foundations: transparency created
via evaluations at the model level and indexes at the organization level.
Finally, the transition from understanding to action: superior understanding of
the societal impact of foundation models advances evidence-based AI policy.
View together, this dissertation makes inroads into achieving better societal
outcomes in the age of AI by building the scientific foundations and
research-policy interface required for better AI governance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在深度关系推理任务中的能力，并比较不同模型的性能。

Method: 通过设计家族树和一般图推理的基准任务，评估三种模型的推理能力。

Result: DeepSeek-R1在多个任务中表现最佳，但随着问题复杂度增加，所有模型表现下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在复杂推理任务中的局限性，并提出了未来改进方向，如多模态推理和系统性分析推理失败。

Abstract: How far are Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing deep relational
reasoning? In this paper, we evaluate and compare the reasoning capabilities of
three cutting-edge LLMs, namely, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o, through a
suite of carefully designed benchmark tasks in family tree and general graph
reasoning. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieves the
highest F1-scores across multiple tasks and problem sizes, demonstrating strong
aptitude in logical deduction and relational inference. However, all evaluated
models, including DeepSeek-R1, struggle significantly as problem complexity
increases, largely due to token length limitations and incomplete output
structures. A detailed analysis of DeepSeek-R1's long Chain-of-Thought
responses uncovers its unique planning and verification strategies, but also
highlights instances of incoherent or incomplete reasoning, calling attention
to the need for deeper scrutiny into LLMs' internal inference dynamics. We
further discuss key directions for future work, including the role of
multimodal reasoning and the systematic examination of reasoning failures. Our
findings provide both empirical insights and theoretical implications for
advancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, particularly in tasks that demand
structured, multi-step logical inference. Our code repository will be publicly
available at https://github.com/kelvinhkcs/Deep-Relational-Reasoning.

Abstract: Semantic context surrounding a triplet $(h, r, t)$ is crucial for Knowledge
Graph Completion (KGC), providing vital cues for prediction. However,
traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge
graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or
over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring
edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational
message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a
\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this
strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its
incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most
pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is
effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a
\textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused
node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and
features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures
and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link
prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing approaches on several established
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在形式概念分析（FCA）中，格的分配性缺乏标准化度量，需要一种量化方法。

Method: 引入“rises”概念，用于评估格中属性或对象数量的变化，并与经典分配性概念关联。

Result: 证明格是分配性的当且仅当无非单位rises；现实数据的概念格多为join-distributive，而非meet-distributive。

Conclusion: rises是量化分配性的有效工具，揭示了现实数据中分配性的分布特点。

Abstract: Distributivity is a well-established and extensively studied notion in
lattice theory. In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal
Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of
distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this
property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices
as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes
or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that
a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore,
we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We
observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree
join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive. We additionally study how
join-distributivity manifests on the level of ordered sets.

Motivation: 理解LLMs在自主代理中的合作机制，确保其部署的安全性和稳健性。

Method: 通过公共物品博弈实验，观察不同LLMs在重复互动中的行为模式。

Result: 发现四种行为模式，推理能力强的模型合作表现较差。

Conclusion: 当前提升LLMs推理能力的方法未必能促进合作，对需要协作的环境部署有重要启示。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming
increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and
collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,
robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of
costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide
whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize
defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional
choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs
navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four
distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and
sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and
disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and
others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we
find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with
cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of
cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving
LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not
necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM
agents in environments that require sustained collaboration. Our code is

Abstract: Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations rely on rigid rule-based
systems that fail to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral
diversity characteristic of human travel decision-making. Recent advances in
large language models and AI agent technology offer opportunities to create
agents with reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning
mechanisms. We propose GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel
framework that leverages these advances to create generative agents with rich
behavioral characteristics for urban mobility simulation. Unlike conventional
approaches, GATSim agents possess diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual
lifestyles, and evolving preferences that shape their mobility decisions
through psychologically-informed memory systems, tool usage capabilities, and
lifelong learning mechanisms. The main contributions of this study include: (1)
a comprehensive architecture combining an urban mobility foundation model with
agent cognitive systems and transport simulation environment, (2) a fully
functional prototype implementation, and (3) systematic validation
demonstrating that generative agents produce believable travel behaviors.
Through designed reflection processes, generative agents in this study can
transform specific travel experiences into generalized insights, enabling
realistic behavioral adaptation over time with specialized mechanisms for
activity planning and real-time reactive behaviors tailored to urban mobility
contexts. Experiments show that generative agents perform competitively with
human annotators in mobility scenarios while naturally producing macroscopic
traffic evolution patterns. The code for the prototype system is shared at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DocVQA系统在伦理上不透明，存在过度自信或不确定性传达不足的问题，可能导致高风险领域的伦理责任问题。

Method: HonestVQA采用模型无关的方法，包括不确定性量化、加权损失函数对齐置信度与正确性，以及通过对比学习强制伦理响应行为。

Result: HonestVQA在多个数据集上提升了DocVQA的准确性和F1分数，同时降低了过度自信，表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: HonestVQA通过伦理对齐和自监督学习，显著提升了DocVQA系统的性能和可靠性，为伦理敏感的领域提供了更可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) systems are increasingly deployed
in real world applications, yet they remain ethically opaque-often producing
overconfident answers to ambiguous questions or failing to communicate
uncertainty in a trustworthy manner. This misalignment between model confidence
and actual knowledge poses significant risks, particularly in domains requiring
ethical accountability. Existing approaches such as LayoutLMv3, UDOP, and DONUT
have advanced SOTA performance by focusing on architectural sophistication and
accuracy; however, they fall short in ethical responsiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce HonestVQA, a self-supervised
honesty calibration framework for ethically aligned DocVQA. Our model-agnostic
method quantifies uncertainty to identify knowledge gaps, aligns model
confidence with actual correctness using weighted loss functions, and enforces
ethical response behavior via contrastive learning. We further introduce two
principled evaluation metrics--Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence
Index (ECI)--to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical
communication. Empirically, HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy by up to 4.3%
and F1 by 4.3% across SpDocVQA, InfographicsVQA, and SROIE datasets. It reduces
overconfidence, lowering H-Score and ECI by 0.072 and 0.078, respectively. In
cross domain evaluation, it achieves up to 78.9% accuracy and 76.1% F1-score,
demonstrating strong generalization. Ablation shows a 3.8% drop in accuracy
without alignment or contrastive loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏有效方法分析社交媒体中的认知路径，这对心理治疗师提供及时干预至关重要。

Method: 结合BERT、RoBERTa进行情感分析，T5、PEGASUS进行文本摘要，mT5进行多语言翻译，以检测负面情绪和认知扭曲。

Result: 系统不仅能识别负面思维，还能预测其他心理健康问题，如恐惧症和饮食障碍。

Conclusion: 该系统为心理治疗师提供了早期检测和干预的强大工具，扩展了CBT的应用范围。

Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a proven approach for addressing the
irrational thought patterns associated with mental health disorders, but its
effectiveness relies on accurately identifying cognitive pathways to provide
targeted treatment. In today's digital age, individuals often express negative
emotions on social media, where they may reveal cognitive distortions, and in
severe cases, exhibit suicidal tendencies. However, there is a significant gap
in methodologies designed to analyze these cognitive pathways, which could be
critical for psychotherapists aiming to deliver timely and effective
interventions in online environments. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
framework leveraging acceptance, commitment and data augmentation to categorize
and address both textual and visual content as positive or negative.
Specifically, the system employs BERT, RoBERTa for Sentiment Analysis and T5,
PEGASUS for Text Summarization, mT5 for Text Translation in Multiple Languages
focusing on detecting negative emotions and cognitive distortions within social
media data. While existing models are primarily designed to identify negative
thoughts, the proposed system goes beyond this by predicting additional
negative side effects and other potential mental health disorders likes
Phobias, Eating Disorders. This enhancement allows for a more comprehensive
understanding and intervention strategy, offering psychotherapists a powerful
tool for early detection and treatment of various psychological issues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅关注需求和价格，无法准确预测电价，且对时间序列数据的处理能力有限。

Method: 结合AlexNet的特征提取能力和LSTM的序列学习能力，引入外部变量（如温度、阳光、降雨等），并采用最小-最大缩放和时间窗口技术。

Result: 混合模型的预测准确率达到97.08%，优于单独的RNN（96.64%）和ANN（96.63%）模型。

Conclusion: 该混合模型显著提高了电价预测的准确性，证明了其在处理复杂时间序列数据中的优势。

Abstract: The recent development of advanced machine learning methods for hybrid models
has greatly addressed the need for the correct prediction of electrical prices.
This method combines AlexNet and LSTM algorithms, which are used to introduce a
new model with higher accuracy in price forecasting. Despite RNN and ANN being
effective, they often fail to deal with forex time sequence data. The
traditional methods do not accurately forecast the prices. These traditional
methods only focus on demand and price which leads to insufficient analysis of
data. To address this issue, using the hybrid approach, which focuses on
external variables that also effect the predicted prices. Nevertheless, due to
AlexNet's excellent feature extraction and LSTM's learning sequential patterns,
the prediction accuracy is vastly increased. The model is built on the past
data, which has been supplied with the most significant elements like demand,
temperature, sunlight, and rain. For example, the model applies methods, such
as minimum-maximum scaling and a time window, to predict the electricity prices
of the future. The results show that this hybrid model is good than the
standalone ones in terms of accuracy. Although we got our accuracy rating of
97.08, it shows higher accompaniments than remaining models RNN and ANN with
accuracies of 96.64 and 96.63 respectively.

Motivation: 随着学生使用AI工具的增加，教师依赖AI检测工具，但其可靠性尚不明确。

Method: 收集28篇AI生成和50篇人类写作的文本，按长度分类后使用GPTZero检测。

Result: AI生成文本检测准确率高（91-100%），但人类文本存在误报。

Conclusion: GPTZero对纯AI文本有效，但对人类文本区分能力有限，需谨慎使用。

Abstract: As the use of AI tools by students has become more prevalent, instructors
have started using AI detection tools like GPTZero and QuillBot to detect AI
written text. However, the reliability of these detectors remains uncertain. In
our study, we focused mostly on the success rate of GPTZero, the most-used AI
detector, in identifying AI-generated texts based on different lengths of
randomly submitted essays: short (40-100 word count), medium (100-350 word
count), and long (350-800 word count). We gathered a data set consisting of
twenty-eight AI-generated papers and fifty human-written papers. With this
randomized essay data, papers were individually plugged into GPTZero and
measured for percentage of AI generation and confidence. A vast majority of the
AI-generated papers were detected accurately (ranging from 91-100% AI believed
generation), while the human generated essays fluctuated; there were a handful
of false positives. These findings suggest that although GPTZero is effective
at detecting purely AI-generated content, its reliability in distinguishing
human-authored texts is limited. Educators should therefore exercise caution
when relying solely on AI detection tools.

Motivation: 随着机器人合成在有机化学中的兴趣增加，从文献中自动提取化学步骤变得至关重要，但化学语言的模糊性和高成本的人工标注使其具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种顺序LLM生成的数据框架，结合数据选择模块和多轮LLM循环评估指标，生成机器可执行的动作。

Result: 在反应到描述（R2D）和描述到动作（D2A）任务中，ChemActor表现优于基线模型10%。

Conclusion: ChemActor通过LLM生成的数据增强了性能，展示了在化学实验步骤理解上的先进性。

Abstract: With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic
chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is
critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity
of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for
developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present
ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical
executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured
action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to
address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This
framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on
distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate
machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we
introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the
model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive
experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A)
tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%. The code

Result: 在Overcooked基准测试中显著优于基线方法，人类评估也证实其高效协作能力。

Conclusion: CooT展现了在多智能体场景中的鲁棒性、灵活性和上下文敏感性，是高效的协作伙伴。

Abstract: Effective coordination among artificial agents in dynamic and uncertain
environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, such as self-play and population-based methods, either generalize
poorly to unseen partners or require extensive training. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (CooT), a novel in-context
coordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to adapt to
unseen partners rapidly. Unlike previous approaches that primarily aim to
increase the diversity of training partners, CooT explicitly focuses on
adapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed
partner interactions. Trained on interaction trajectories collected from
diverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns
effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning.
Evaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly
outperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen
partners. Human evaluations further confirm CooT as the most effective
collaborative partner, while extensive ablations highlight its robustness,
flexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios.

Motivation: 现有MLLM基准在评估长链推理能力时存在不足，包括缺乏难度和多样性、易受猜测和记忆影响，以及对中间推理步骤评估不足。

Method: MMReason通过以下方法设计：（1）从多学科和多难度级别筛选挑战性问题；（2）将问题转化为开放形式并使用多模型投票技术过滤；（3）标注详细步骤并设计三元评分机制评估推理步骤。

Abstract: Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM
benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating
long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty
and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3)
inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we
introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively
evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,
challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring
multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple
difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from
foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated
into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to
eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust
reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed
step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism
to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark
popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning
capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing
MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at

Result: 多智能体系统提升防御效果，但效果因攻击类型而异，并增加误报和计算开销。

Conclusion: 当前自动防御存在局限，需改进未来LLM系统的对齐鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about
jailbreaking attacks, i.e., prompts that bypass safety mechanisms. This paper
investigates the use of multi-agent LLM systems as a defence against such
attacks. We evaluate three jailbreaking strategies, including the original
AutoDefense attack and two from Deepleaps: BetterDan and JB. Reproducing the
AutoDefense framework, we compare single-agent setups with two- and three-agent
configurations. Our results show that multi-agent systems enhance resistance to
jailbreaks, especially by reducing false negatives. However, its effectiveness
varies by attack type, and it introduces trade-offs such as increased false
positives and computational overhead. These findings point to the limitations
of current automated defences and suggest directions for improving alignment
robustness in future LLM systems.

Conclusion: 自动化LM引导的奖励权重调整方法有效，性能接近人工调优，减少了对手动奖励工程的依赖。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in games has gained significant momentum in
recent years, enabling the creation of different agent behaviors that can
transform a player's gaming experience. However, deploying RL agents in
production environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective
reward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content
or mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be
optimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for
iteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a
user-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes
updated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary
of performance statistics from prior training rounds. This closed-loop process
allows the LM to self-correct and refine its output over time, producing
increasingly aligned behavior without the need for manual reward engineering.
We evaluate our approach in a racing task and show that it consistently
improves agent performance across iterations. The LM-guided agents show a
significant increase in performance from $9\%$ to $74\%$ success rate in just
one iteration. We compare our LM-guided tuning against a human expert's manual
weight design in the racing task: by the final iteration, the LM-tuned agent
achieved an $80\%$ success rate, and completed laps in an average of $855$ time
steps, a competitive performance against the expert-tuned agent's peak $94\%$
success, and $850$ time steps.

Abstract: Domain shift is a critical problem for pathology AI as pathology data is
heavily influenced by center-specific conditions. Current pathology domain
adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to
capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this
work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a
Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD
achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient
slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical
adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for
feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to
preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency
Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype
selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method
on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC
improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in
a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable
slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing
both computational and annotation costs.

Motivation: 开发一个能够自主玩Pok\'emon Red的多代理LLM框架，探索语言模型在游戏策略中的表现。

Method: 系统由三个代理组成：规划代理生成任务，执行代理完成任务，评估代理验证结果。初步开发了战斗模块。

Result: 战斗模块在50次野生对战中平均胜率为80.8%，接近人类玩家水平。语言能力与战略推理能力相关，不同LLM表现出独特的游戏风格。

Conclusion: Pok\'eAI展示了LLM在游戏策略中的潜力，语言能力与战略推理之间存在关联，且不同模型表现出独特的游戏风格。

Abstract: We introduce Pok\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model
(LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\'emon
Red. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and
Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent
functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game.
These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out
within the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates
the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once
verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a
closed-loop decision-making system.
  As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution
Agent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of
80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an
experienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle
performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related
tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic
reasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM
exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct
strategic behaviors.

a five-level classification for Agent4S, outlining a clear roadmap from simple
task automation to fully autonomous, collaborative "AI Scientists." This
framework defines the next revolutionary step in scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于系统理论和数据分析的新视角，旨在通过跨学科方法提升AI安全性，称为“数据控制”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在安全关键领域的快速发展缺乏足够的安全性保障，需要结合控制理论和数据驱动方法来提升AI安全性。

Method: 采用系统理论和系统分析驱动的方法，提出数据控制的概念，结合现有安全分析和保障技术。

Result: 提出了一种通用的安全分析和保障框架，适用于特定AI系统和应用，并为未来创新奠定基础。

Conclusion: 跨学科的数据控制方法为AI安全性提供了新视角，有望推动AI工程的发展。

Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and mastering
increasingly complex problems with astonishing performance, the safety
assurance of such systems is a major concern. Particularly in the context of
safety-critical, real-world cyber-physical systems, AI promises to achieve a
new level of autonomy but is hampered by a lack of safety assurance. While
data-driven control takes up recent developments in AI to improve control
systems, control theory in general could be leveraged to improve AI safety.
Therefore, this article outlines a new perspective on AI safety based on an
interdisciplinary interpretation of the underlying data-generation process and
the respective abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired and system
analysis-driven manner. In this context, the new perspective, also referred to
as data control, aims to stimulate AI engineering to take advantage of existing
safety analysis and assurance in an interdisciplinary way to drive the paradigm
of data control. Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety
analysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for
specific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.

Abstract: Benchmarks are important measures to evaluate safety and compliance of AI
models at scale. However, they typically do not offer verifiable results and
lack confidentiality for model IP and benchmark datasets. We propose Attestable
Audits, which run inside Trusted Execution Environments and enable users to

even when model provider and auditor do not trust each other. This addresses
verification challenges raised in recent AI governance frameworks. We build a

TL;DR: 使用图神经网络（GNN）对词方程进行排序，提升求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Nielsen变换求解词方程时，处理顺序对性能影响大，需优化排序方法。

Method: 提出基于图的词方程表示，结合GNN进行排序，并处理变量数量问题。

Result: 实验表明，新框架在特定基准测试中优于现有字符串求解器。

Conclusion: GNN排序方法有效提升词方程求解性能。

Abstract: Nielsen transformation is a standard approach for solving word equations: by
repeatedly splitting equations and applying simplification steps, equations are
rewritten until a solution is reached. When solving a conjunction of word
equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably
on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving
process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word
equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts,
enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable
number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to
the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done
with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The
experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers,
the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable
appears at most once in each equation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人轨迹规划问题，尤其是在物流和搜救等实际应用中，需要高效且可扩展的MAPF求解器。

Method: 利用集中式专家数据微调预训练的MAPF-GPT模型，并引入delta-data生成机制加速训练。

Result: MAPF-GPT-DDG在测试中表现优于现有学习型求解器，支持单环境中多达100万个智能体的规划。

Conclusion: MAPF-GPT-DDG在性能和可扩展性上取得了突破，为MAPF领域设定了新的里程碑。

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot
trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously
move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to
be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world
applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized
suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage.
Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation
learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively
fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging
a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training
while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF
solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across
many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving
up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for
scalability in MAPF domains.

Result: 较大模型在生成类人动作序列上表现更优，但较小模型也能达到满意效果。

Conclusion: 结合自然语言和拖放界面的方法可行，且模型规模对性能有显著影响。

Abstract: Robot end users increasingly require accessible means of specifying tasks for
robots to perform. Two common end-user programming paradigms include
drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming. Although natural
language interfaces harness an intuitive form of human communication,
drag-and-drop interfaces enable users to meticulously and precisely dictate the
key actions of the robot's task. In this paper, we investigate the degree to
which both approaches can be combined. Specifically, we construct a large
language model (LLM)-based pipeline that accepts natural language as input and
produces human-like action sequences as output, specified at a level of
granularity that a human would produce. We then compare these generated action
sequences to another dataset of hand-specified action sequences. Although our
results reveal that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in the
production of human-like action sequences, smaller models nonetheless achieve
satisfactory performance.

Result: Ludax提供了详细的描述语言和技术说明，并通过速度基准测试和RL代理训练展示了其性能。

Conclusion: Ludax作为开源工具，有望加速从RL到认知科学的游戏研究。

Abstract: Games have long been used as benchmarks and testing environments for research
in artificial intelligence. A key step in supporting this research was the
development of game description languages: frameworks that compile
domain-specific code into playable and simulatable game environments, allowing
researchers to generalize their algorithms and approaches across multiple games
without having to manually implement each one. More recently, progress in
reinforcement learning (RL) has been largely driven by advances in hardware
acceleration. Libraries like JAX allow practitioners to take full advantage of
cutting-edge computing hardware, often speeding up training and testing by
orders of magnitude. Here, we present a synthesis of these strands of research:
a domain-specific language for board games which automatically compiles into
hardware-accelerated code. Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of
game description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing
hardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines.
We envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from
RL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible
representation scheme. We present a detailed breakdown of Ludax's description
language and technical notes on the compilation process, along with speed
benchmarking and a demonstration of training RL agents. The Ludax framework,
along with implementations of existing board games, is open-source and freely
available.

Conclusion: 解释性方法应针对具体用途设计和评估，结合理论与实证视角，以确保其实际价值。

Abstract: Modern methods for explainable machine learning are designed to describe how
models map inputs to outputs--without deep consideration of how these
explanations will be used in practice. This paper argues that explanations
should be designed and evaluated with a specific end in mind. We describe how
to formalize this end in a framework based in statistical decision theory. We
show how this functionally-grounded approach can be applied across diverse use
cases, such as clinical decision support, providing recourse, or debugging. We
demonstrate its use to characterize the maximum "boost" in performance on a
particular task that an explanation could provide an idealized decision-maker,
preventing misuse due to ambiguity by forcing researchers to specify concrete
use cases that can be analyzed in light of models of expected explanation use.
We argue that evaluation should meld theoretical and empirical perspectives on
the value of explanation, and contribute definitions that span these
perspectives.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功结合了伦理与算法，为AI可信度评估提供了更客观、全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges
posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into
society and exert significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and
their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial
risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The
complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead
to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or
understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and
guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools
aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view
of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness.
Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such
quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific
aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method
that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic
processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment
framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment
techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The
application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI
system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights
while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.

Conclusion: ReasonBridge为推理能力提升提供了样本高效的方法，适用于多种领域和架构。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed a
significant performance gap between closed-source and open-source models,
particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and precise instruction
following. This paper introduces ReasonBridge, a methodology that efficiently
transfers reasoning capabilities from powerful closed-source to open-source
models through a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. We
develop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning
traces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality. These traces are
filtered from across multiple domains using a structured multi-criteria
selection algorithm. Our transfer learning approach incorporates: (1) a
hierarchical distillation process capturing both strategic abstraction and
tactical implementation patterns, (2) a sparse reasoning-focused adapter
architecture requiring only 0.3% additional trainable parameters, and (3) a
test-time compute scaling mechanism using guided inference interventions.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ReasonBridge improves reasoning
capabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks,
significantly narrowing the gap with closed-source models. Notably, the
enhanced Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Claude-Sonnet3.5 on MATH500 and matches its
performance on competition-level AIME problems. Our methodology generalizes
effectively across diverse reasoning domains and model architectures,
establishing a sample-efficient approach to reasoning enhancement for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型的专家依赖相同的归纳偏差，限制了表示多样性和计算效率，Hecto旨在通过异构架构解决这一问题。

Method: Hecto结合GRU专家（时间推理）和FFNN专家（静态抽象），采用稀疏Top-1门控机制。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，Hecto性能接近同质基线，同时实现了专家专业化（时间与静态推理）。

Conclusion: Hecto为条件计算提供了新基准，通过异构架构在低资源场景下实现专业化推理。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing
inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive
biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation
pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and
limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE
architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU
expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a
sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG
News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely
trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input
representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert
aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch
sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed
computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize
more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the
source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning
tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional
computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in
low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled
specialization.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数学和编程等任务中表现出推理能力，但其缺乏对推理过程的真正理解。本文探索如何通过自玩游戏提升模型的理性。

Method: 设计CDG游戏，其中证明者提供解决方案，随后接受批评者的挑战（包括误导性和建设性反馈），目标是保持或修正答案。

Result: 在数学推理、逐步错误检测、自我修正和长链推理任务中，CDG训练显著提升了模型对推理过程的理解能力。

Conclusion: CDG方法能有效增强LLMs的推理理解能力，无需人类或高级模型的监督。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning
abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent
studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their
reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the
rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans
or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover
first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by
critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the
prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when
faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to
constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical
reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning
demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of
well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.

TL;DR: MARBLE是一个多模态推理基准测试，旨在评估多模态语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂多模态问题中的逐步推理能力。现有模型表现不佳，表明复杂推理仍是挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准主要关注纯文本或多模态直接检索问题，复杂多模态推理能力尚未被充分研究。

Method: MARBLE包含两个高难度任务（M-Portal和M-Cube），要求模型在空间、视觉和物理约束下制定和理解多步计划。

Result: 12个先进MLLMs在M-Portal上表现接近随机，M-Cube上准确率为0%，仅在某些简化子任务中优于随机基线。感知仍是瓶颈。

Conclusion: MARBLE揭示了MLLMs的局限性，希望推动下一代模型在多模态推理能力上的发展。

Abstract: The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason
through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial
intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only
reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly
retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning
remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a
challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize
multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason
step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is
composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the
crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and
physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE --
all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0%
accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the
random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for
existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where
MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By
shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏开源的全语音多轮对话系统，支持工具使用和智能推理。

Method: 结合开源的ASR、TTS和LLM，采用模块化设计，支持自然语言提示和工具集成。

Result: 在VoiceBench上表现优异，接近GPT-4o，任务成功率90%。

Conclusion: AURA填补了开源语音助手的空白，具备高效任务完成能力。

Abstract: Despite advances in language and speech technologies, no open-source system
enables full speech-to-speech, multi-turn dialogue with integrated tool use and
agentic reasoning. We introduce AURA (Agent for Understanding, Reasoning, and
Automated Tool Use), the first open-source, speech-native assistant capable of
completing complex, goal-driven tasks through dynamic tool invocation and
multi-turn conversation. AURA combines open-weight ASR, TTS, and LLMs in a
cascaded pipeline and supports tools such as calendar booking, contact lookup,
web search, and email. Its modular design allows easy integration of new tools
using natural language prompts and action classes. On VoiceBench, AURA scores
92.75% on OpenBookQA-outperforming all open-weight systems and nearing
GPT-4o-and 4.39 on AlpacaEval, competitive with other open-weight systems.
Human evaluation shows 90% task success on complex, multi-turn speech tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个五阶段的AI进化框架，类比人类认知技术的发展历程，揭示了AI从专家系统到Transformers的演变，并预测了未来的发展方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI的发展轨迹，提供一个跨学科的系统模型，解释其历史演变并指导未来研究。

Method: 提出“认知几何”框架，将AI发展分为五个阶段，类比人类认知技术的进步，如文字、逻辑等。

Result: AI的进化是反射性的，当前处于“元语言时刻”，未来将迈向“数学符号时刻”和“形式逻辑系统时刻”。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI的未来研究提供了理论基础和实用策略，是作者三部曲的方法论总结。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive five-stage evolutionary framework for
understanding the development of artificial intelligence, arguing that its
trajectory mirrors the historical progression of human cognitive technologies.
We posit that AI is advancing through distinct epochs, each defined by a
revolutionary shift in its capacity for representation and reasoning, analogous
to the inventions of cuneiform, the alphabet, grammar and logic, mathematical
calculus, and formal logical systems. This "Geometry of Cognition" framework
moves beyond mere metaphor to provide a systematic, cross-disciplinary model
that not only explains AI's past architectural shifts-from expert systems to
Transformers-but also charts a concrete and prescriptive path forward.
Crucially, we demonstrate that this evolution is not merely linear but
reflexive: as AI advances through these stages, the tools and insights it
develops create a feedback loop that fundamentally reshapes its own underlying
architecture. We are currently transitioning into a "Metalinguistic Moment,"
characterized by the emergence of self-reflective capabilities like
Chain-of-Thought prompting and Constitutional AI. The subsequent stages, the
"Mathematical Symbolism Moment" and the "Formal Logic System Moment," will be
defined by the development of a computable calculus of thought, likely through
neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis, culminating in provably
aligned and reliable AI that reconstructs its own foundational representations.
This work serves as the methodological capstone to our trilogy, which
previously explored the economic drivers ("why") and cognitive nature ("what")
of AI. Here, we address the "how," providing a theoretical foundation for
future research and offering concrete, actionable strategies for startups and
developers aiming to build the next generation of intelligent systems.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在模拟风险决策行为中的表现，发现模型比人类更规避风险，且中文提示下的预测偏差更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs应用的扩展，其在复杂决策行为（如风险决策）中的可靠性引发关注，本研究旨在评估其模拟能力。

Method: 通过彩票任务比较ChatGPT 4o和ChatGPT o1-mini的预测与人类实际选择，使用CRRA框架分析风险偏好，并考察多语言数据的影响。

Result: 模型比人类更规避风险，o1-mini更接近人类行为；中文提示下的预测偏差大于英文。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟人类风险行为方面有潜力，但在语言和文化背景下的表现仍有局限。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides, extending their
applications to dialogue systems, automated content creation, and
domain-specific advisory tasks. However, as their use grows, concerns have
emerged regarding their reliability in simulating complex decision-making
behavior, such as risky decision-making, where a single choice can lead to
multiple outcomes. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate
risky decision-making scenarios. We compare model-generated decisions with
actual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation
stated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong,
and Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and
ChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk
preferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA)
framework. Results show that both models exhibit more risk-averse behavior than
human participants, with o1-mini aligning more closely with observed human
decisions. Further analysis of multilingual data from Nanjing and Hong Kong
indicates that model predictions in Chinese deviate more from actual responses
compared to English, suggesting that prompt language may influence simulation
performance. These findings highlight both the promise and the current
limitations of LLMs in replicating human-like risk behavior, particularly in
linguistic and cultural settings.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is humanity's most promising technology because of
the remarkable capabilities offered by foundation models. Yet, the same
technology brings confusion and consternation: foundation models are poorly
understood and they may precipitate a wide array of harms. This dissertation
explains how technology and society coevolve in the age of AI, organized around
three themes. First, the conceptual framing: the capabilities, risks, and the
supply chain that grounds foundation models in the broader economy. Second, the
empirical insights that enrich the conceptual foundations: transparency created
via evaluations at the model level and indexes at the organization level.
Finally, the transition from understanding to action: superior understanding of
the societal impact of foundation models advances evidence-based AI policy.
View together, this dissertation makes inroads into achieving better societal
outcomes in the age of AI by building the scientific foundations and
research-policy interface required for better AI governance.

Method: 通过设计家族树和一般图推理的基准任务，评估三种模型的推理能力，并分析其表现。

Result: DeepSeek-R1在多项任务中表现最佳，但所有模型在复杂任务中表现不佳，主要受限于输出结构和推理不完整。

Conclusion: 研究为大语言模型的推理能力提供了实证和理论启示，并指出了未来研究方向，如多模态推理和系统性失败分析。

Abstract: How far are Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing deep relational
reasoning? In this paper, we evaluate and compare the reasoning capabilities of
three cutting-edge LLMs, namely, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o, through a
suite of carefully designed benchmark tasks in family tree and general graph
reasoning. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieves the
highest F1-scores across multiple tasks and problem sizes, demonstrating strong
aptitude in logical deduction and relational inference. However, all evaluated
models, including DeepSeek-R1, struggle significantly as problem complexity
increases, largely due to token length limitations and incomplete output
structures. A detailed analysis of DeepSeek-R1's long Chain-of-Thought
responses uncovers its unique planning and verification strategies, but also
highlights instances of incoherent or incomplete reasoning, calling attention
to the need for deeper scrutiny into LLMs' internal inference dynamics. We
further discuss key directions for future work, including the role of
multimodal reasoning and the systematic examination of reasoning failures. Our
findings provide both empirical insights and theoretical implications for
advancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, particularly in tasks that demand
structured, multi-step logical inference. Our code repository will be publicly

Method: 引入语义感知的Top-K邻居选择策略，评估节点与边的语义相关性，并通过多头注意力聚合器融合信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能更准确地捕捉和传播与任务相关的上下文信息，有效减少无关信息的干扰。

Abstract: Semantic context surrounding a triplet $(h, r, t)$ is crucial for Knowledge
Graph Completion (KGC), providing vital cues for prediction. However,
traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge
graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or
over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring
edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational
message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a
\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this
strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its
incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most
pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is
effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a
\textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused
node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and
features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures
and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link
prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing approaches on several established
benchmarks.

Motivation: 在形式概念分析中，格的高分配性常见但缺乏标准化度量方法。

Method: 引入“上升”概念，用于评估概念格中属性或对象数量的变化，并与经典的分配性概念关联。

Result: 现实数据的概念格高度满足并分配性，但较少满足交分配性。

Conclusion: 上升是量化分配性的有效工具，揭示了现实数据中分配性的分布特点。

Abstract: Distributivity is a well-established and extensively studied notion in
lattice theory. In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal
Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of
distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this
property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices
as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes
or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that
a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore,
we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We
observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree
join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive. We additionally study how
join-distributivity manifests on the level of ordered sets.

Conclusion: 当前提升LLMs推理能力的方法未必能促进合作，为需要持续协作的环境提供了重要启示。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming
increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and
collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,
robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of
costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide
whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize
defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional
choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs
navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four
distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and
sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and
disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and
others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we
find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with
cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of
cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving
LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not
necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM
agents in environments that require sustained collaboration. Our code is

Abstract: Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations rely on rigid rule-based
systems that fail to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral
diversity characteristic of human travel decision-making. Recent advances in
large language models and AI agent technology offer opportunities to create
agents with reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning
mechanisms. We propose GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel
framework that leverages these advances to create generative agents with rich
behavioral characteristics for urban mobility simulation. Unlike conventional
approaches, GATSim agents possess diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual
lifestyles, and evolving preferences that shape their mobility decisions
through psychologically-informed memory systems, tool usage capabilities, and
lifelong learning mechanisms. The main contributions of this study include: (1)
a comprehensive architecture combining an urban mobility foundation model with
agent cognitive systems and transport simulation environment, (2) a fully
functional prototype implementation, and (3) systematic validation
demonstrating that generative agents produce believable travel behaviors.
Through designed reflection processes, generative agents in this study can
transform specific travel experiences into generalized insights, enabling
realistic behavioral adaptation over time with specialized mechanisms for
activity planning and real-time reactive behaviors tailored to urban mobility
contexts. Experiments show that generative agents perform competitively with
human annotators in mobility scenarios while naturally producing macroscopic
traffic evolution patterns. The code for the prototype system is shared at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DocVQA系统在伦理响应方面表现不足，模型置信度与实际知识不匹配，可能导致高风险决策。HonestVQA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HonestVQA采用自监督框架，通过加权损失函数对齐模型置信度与正确性，并使用对比学习强制伦理响应行为。同时引入H-Score和ECI两个评估指标。

Result: HonestVQA在多个数据集上提升了DocVQA的准确性和F1分数，降低了过度自信，并展示了良好的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: HonestVQA通过伦理对齐和不确定性量化，显著提升了DocVQA系统的性能和可信度，为伦理敏感的领域提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) systems are increasingly deployed
in real world applications, yet they remain ethically opaque-often producing
overconfident answers to ambiguous questions or failing to communicate
uncertainty in a trustworthy manner. This misalignment between model confidence
and actual knowledge poses significant risks, particularly in domains requiring
ethical accountability. Existing approaches such as LayoutLMv3, UDOP, and DONUT
have advanced SOTA performance by focusing on architectural sophistication and
accuracy; however, they fall short in ethical responsiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce HonestVQA, a self-supervised
honesty calibration framework for ethically aligned DocVQA. Our model-agnostic
method quantifies uncertainty to identify knowledge gaps, aligns model
confidence with actual correctness using weighted loss functions, and enforces
ethical response behavior via contrastive learning. We further introduce two
principled evaluation metrics--Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence
Index (ECI)--to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical
communication. Empirically, HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy by up to 4.3%
and F1 by 4.3% across SpDocVQA, InfographicsVQA, and SROIE datasets. It reduces
overconfidence, lowering H-Score and ECI by 0.072 and 0.078, respectively. In
cross domain evaluation, it achieves up to 78.9% accuracy and 76.1% F1-score,
demonstrating strong generalization. Ablation shows a 3.8% drop in accuracy
without alignment or contrastive loss.

Conclusion: 该系统为心理治疗师提供了早期检测和干预的强大工具，扩展了CBT的应用范围。

Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a proven approach for addressing the
irrational thought patterns associated with mental health disorders, but its
effectiveness relies on accurately identifying cognitive pathways to provide
targeted treatment. In today's digital age, individuals often express negative
emotions on social media, where they may reveal cognitive distortions, and in
severe cases, exhibit suicidal tendencies. However, there is a significant gap
in methodologies designed to analyze these cognitive pathways, which could be
critical for psychotherapists aiming to deliver timely and effective
interventions in online environments. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
framework leveraging acceptance, commitment and data augmentation to categorize
and address both textual and visual content as positive or negative.
Specifically, the system employs BERT, RoBERTa for Sentiment Analysis and T5,
PEGASUS for Text Summarization, mT5 for Text Translation in Multiple Languages
focusing on detecting negative emotions and cognitive distortions within social
media data. While existing models are primarily designed to identify negative
thoughts, the proposed system goes beyond this by predicting additional
negative side effects and other potential mental health disorders likes
Phobias, Eating Disorders. This enhancement allows for a more comprehensive
understanding and intervention strategy, offering psychotherapists a powerful
tool for early detection and treatment of various psychological issues.

Motivation: 传统方法（如RNN和ANN）在处理外汇时间序列数据时表现不佳，且仅关注需求和价格，导致分析不足。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合AlexNet的特征提取能力和LSTM的序列学习能力，并引入外部变量（如需求、温度、阳光和降雨）。

Result: 混合模型的预测准确率达到97.08%，优于RNN（96.64%）和ANN（96.63%）。

Conclusion: 该混合模型在电力价格预测中表现出更高的准确性和优越性。

Abstract: The recent development of advanced machine learning methods for hybrid models
has greatly addressed the need for the correct prediction of electrical prices.
This method combines AlexNet and LSTM algorithms, which are used to introduce a
new model with higher accuracy in price forecasting. Despite RNN and ANN being
effective, they often fail to deal with forex time sequence data. The
traditional methods do not accurately forecast the prices. These traditional
methods only focus on demand and price which leads to insufficient analysis of
data. To address this issue, using the hybrid approach, which focuses on
external variables that also effect the predicted prices. Nevertheless, due to
AlexNet's excellent feature extraction and LSTM's learning sequential patterns,
the prediction accuracy is vastly increased. The model is built on the past
data, which has been supplied with the most significant elements like demand,
temperature, sunlight, and rain. For example, the model applies methods, such
as minimum-maximum scaling and a time window, to predict the electricity prices
of the future. The results show that this hybrid model is good than the
standalone ones in terms of accuracy. Although we got our accuracy rating of
97.08, it shows higher accompaniments than remaining models RNN and ANN with
accuracies of 96.64 and 96.63 respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI检测工具（如GPTZero）在识别不同长度AI生成文本中的可靠性，以评估其实际应用效果。

Method: 收集28篇AI生成和50篇人类写作的论文，按长度分类后使用GPTZero检测AI生成比例和置信度。

Result: AI生成文本检测准确率高达91-100%，但人类写作存在误判（假阳性）。

Conclusion: GPTZero对纯AI生成内容有效，但对人类文本区分能力有限，教育者需谨慎依赖。

Abstract: As the use of AI tools by students has become more prevalent, instructors
have started using AI detection tools like GPTZero and QuillBot to detect AI
written text. However, the reliability of these detectors remains uncertain. In
our study, we focused mostly on the success rate of GPTZero, the most-used AI
detector, in identifying AI-generated texts based on different lengths of
randomly submitted essays: short (40-100 word count), medium (100-350 word
count), and long (350-800 word count). We gathered a data set consisting of
twenty-eight AI-generated papers and fifty human-written papers. With this
randomized essay data, papers were individually plugged into GPTZero and
measured for percentage of AI generation and confidence. A vast majority of the
AI-generated papers were detected accurately (ranging from 91-100% AI believed
generation), while the human generated essays fluctuated; there were a handful
of false positives. These findings suggest that although GPTZero is effective
at detecting purely AI-generated content, its reliability in distinguishing
human-authored texts is limited. Educators should therefore exercise caution
when relying solely on AI detection tools.

Conclusion: ChemActor通过LLM生成的数据框架，显著提升了化学实验步骤的自动化提取性能，为化学合成自动化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic
chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is
critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity
of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for
developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present
ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical
executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured
action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to
address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This
framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on
distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate
machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we
introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Coordination Transformers（CooT）的新框架，通过上下文协调快速适应未见过的合作伙伴。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中动态和不确定环境下协调的挑战，现有方法泛化能力差或训练成本高。

Method: 使用交互历史预测合作伙伴行为，无需显式监督或微调。

Result: 在Overcooked基准测试中显著优于基线方法，人类评估也证实其有效性。

Conclusion: CooT在未见合作伙伴的协调任务中表现出色，具有鲁棒性和灵活性。

Abstract: Effective coordination among artificial agents in dynamic and uncertain
environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, such as self-play and population-based methods, either generalize
poorly to unseen partners or require extensive training. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (CooT), a novel in-context
coordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to adapt to
unseen partners rapidly. Unlike previous approaches that primarily aim to
increase the diversity of training partners, CooT explicitly focuses on
adapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed
partner interactions. Trained on interaction trajectories collected from
diverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns
effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning.
Evaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly
outperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen
partners. Human evaluations further confirm CooT as the most effective
collaborative partner, while extensive ablations highlight its robustness,
flexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios.

TL;DR: MMReason是一个新的基准测试，旨在全面评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的长链推理能力，通过多样化的开放式问题解决现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM基准在评估长链推理能力时存在不足，包括缺乏难度和多样性、易受猜测和记忆影响，以及对中间推理步骤评估不足。

Method: MMReason通过多学科、多难度的问题集，开放式问题格式，多模型投票过滤，以及基于参考的三元评分机制来解决这些问题。

Result: MMReason对流行的MLLMs进行了基准测试，并深入分析了它们的推理能力。

Conclusion: MMReason有望成为推动MLLM推理研究的重要资源。

Abstract: Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM
benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating
long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty
and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3)
inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we
introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively
evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,
challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring
multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple
difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from
foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated
into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to
eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust
reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed
step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism
to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark
popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning
capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing
MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多代理LLM系统作为防御越狱攻击的有效性。

Method: 比较单代理与多代理（两代理和三代理）配置，评估三种越狱策略（AutoDefense、BetterDan、JB）。

Result: 多代理系统提高防御能力，减少漏报，但效果因攻击类型而异，且增加误报和计算开销。

Conclusion: 当前自动防御存在局限性，未来需改进LLM系统的对齐鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about
jailbreaking attacks, i.e., prompts that bypass safety mechanisms. This paper
investigates the use of multi-agent LLM systems as a defence against such
attacks. We evaluate three jailbreaking strategies, including the original
AutoDefense attack and two from Deepleaps: BetterDan and JB. Reproducing the
AutoDefense framework, we compare single-agent setups with two- and three-agent
configurations. Our results show that multi-agent systems enhance resistance to
jailbreaks, especially by reducing false negatives. However, its effectiveness
varies by attack type, and it introduces trade-offs such as increased false
positives and computational overhead. These findings point to the limitations
of current automated defences and suggest directions for improving alignment
robustness in future LLM systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语言模型的自动调整强化学习奖励函数权重的方法，解决了游戏内容修改后权重失效的问题，显著提升了代理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在游戏中部署强化学习代理时，奖励函数的设计通常需要专家，且游戏内容或机制修改后权重可能失效。

Method: 利用语言模型根据用户定义的行为目标和性能统计自动迭代调整奖励函数权重。

Result: 在赛车任务中，代理性能从9%提升到74%的成功率，最终达到80%成功率，接近专家调整的94%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动奖励工程，能有效自动优化奖励函数权重，性能接近专家水平。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in games has gained significant momentum in
recent years, enabling the creation of different agent behaviors that can
transform a player's gaming experience. However, deploying RL agents in
production environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective
reward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content
or mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be
optimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for
iteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a
user-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes
updated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary
of performance statistics from prior training rounds. This closed-loop process
allows the LM to self-correct and refine its output over time, producing
increasingly aligned behavior without the need for manual reward engineering.
We evaluate our approach in a racing task and show that it consistently
improves agent performance across iterations. The LM-guided agents show a
significant increase in performance from $9\%$ to $74\%$ success rate in just
one iteration. We compare our LM-guided tuning against a human expert's manual
weight design in the racing task: by the final iteration, the LM-tuned agent
achieved an $80\%$ success rate, and completed laps in an average of $855$ time
steps, a competitive performance against the expert-tuned agent's peak $94\%$
success, and $850$ time steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学数据受中心特定条件影响严重，现有方法仅关注图像块而非全幻灯片图像（WSI），无法满足临床需求。

Method: HASD框架包含分层适应（域级对齐、幻灯片级几何不变性正则化和块级注意力一致性正则化）和原型选择机制。

Result: 在五个数据集上验证，乳腺癌HER2分级任务AUROC提升4.1%，UCEC生存预测任务C-index提升3.9%。

Conclusion: HASD为病理学机构提供了一种实用且可靠的幻灯片级域适应解决方案，降低了计算和标注成本。

Abstract: Domain shift is a critical problem for pathology AI as pathology data is
heavily influenced by center-specific conditions. Current pathology domain
adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to
capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this
work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a
Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD
achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient
slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical
adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for
feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to
preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency
Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype
selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method
on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC
improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in
a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable
slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing
both computational and annotation costs.

Motivation: 开发一个能够自主玩Pokémon Red游戏的AI系统，探索语言模型在战略推理和游戏玩法中的潜力。

Method: 采用三个专门智能体（规划、执行、评估）组成的闭环决策系统，每个智能体有独特功能和记忆库。

Result: 战斗模块在50次野生遭遇战中平均胜率为80.8%，接近人类玩家水平，且语言能力与战略表现相关。

Conclusion: PokéAI展示了语言模型在游戏中的战略潜力，不同模型表现出独特的游戏风格。

Abstract: We introduce Pok\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model
(LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\'emon
Red. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and
Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent
functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game.
These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out
within the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates
the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once
verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a
closed-loop decision-making system.
  As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution
Agent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of
80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an
experienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle
performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related
tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic
reasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM
exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct
strategic behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在安全关键领域的快速发展缺乏安全保障，需要结合控制理论和AI技术解决这一问题。

Result: 提出了一种称为“数据控制”的新视角，旨在通过跨学科方法提升AI工程的安全性。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来AI系统的安全创新提供了通用框架，适用于具体应用和未来技术发展。

Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and mastering
increasingly complex problems with astonishing performance, the safety
assurance of such systems is a major concern. Particularly in the context of
safety-critical, real-world cyber-physical systems, AI promises to achieve a
new level of autonomy but is hampered by a lack of safety assurance. While
data-driven control takes up recent developments in AI to improve control
systems, control theory in general could be leveraged to improve AI safety.
Therefore, this article outlines a new perspective on AI safety based on an
interdisciplinary interpretation of the underlying data-generation process and
the respective abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired and system
analysis-driven manner. In this context, the new perspective, also referred to
as data control, aims to stimulate AI engineering to take advantage of existing
safety analysis and assurance in an interdisciplinary way to drive the paradigm
of data control. Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety
analysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for
specific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.

Abstract: Benchmarks are important measures to evaluate safety and compliance of AI
models at scale. However, they typically do not offer verifiable results and
lack confidentiality for model IP and benchmark datasets. We propose Attestable
Audits, which run inside Trusted Execution Environments and enable users to

even when model provider and auditor do not trust each other. This addresses
verification challenges raised in recent AI governance frameworks. We build a
prototype demonstrating feasibility on typical audit benchmarks against

Motivation: 解决词方程时，处理顺序对求解性能有显著影响，传统方法缺乏全局视角。

Method: 提出基于图的词方程表示方法，结合GNN进行排序，并利用最小不可满足子集（MUSes）训练模型。

Result: 在变量在每个方程中最多出现一次的基准测试中，新框架优于现有求解器。

Conclusion: GNN结合全局信息能有效提升词方程求解性能。

Abstract: Nielsen transformation is a standard approach for solving word equations: by
repeatedly splitting equations and applying simplification steps, equations are
rewritten until a solution is reached. When solving a conjunction of word
equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably
on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving
process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word
equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts,
enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable
number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to
the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done
with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The
experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers,
the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable
appears at most once in each equation.

Conclusion: MAPF-GPT-DDG为多智能体路径规划提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot
trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously
move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to
be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world
applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized
suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage.
Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation
learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively
fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging
a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training
while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF
solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across
many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving
up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for
scalability in MAPF domains.

Conclusion: R2A2框架通过风险感知建模和联合奖励-风险优化，为自主AI代理提供了主动安全决策的基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of
autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic,
open-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from
static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these
capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also
introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool
misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the
threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we
first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin
increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention,
modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze
the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying
failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and
deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment.
These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across
perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges,
we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different
autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control,
constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective
reflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a
unified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes
(CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation,
and joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety
across the agent's decision-making loop.

Result: 精确学习是实现可靠演绎推理的关键。

Conclusion: 精确学习应成为算法设计的核心目标。

Abstract: Sound deductive reasoning -- the ability to derive new knowledge from
existing facts and rules -- is an indisputably desirable aspect of general
intelligence. Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math
and science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it
is well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and
consistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these
systems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general
intelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound
behavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their
development. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive
reasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift
from optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning
problems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning
paradigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning
is both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide
algorithm design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited expert-level capabilities across
various domains. However, their abilities to solve problems in Operations
Research (OR) -- the analysis and optimization of mathematical models derived
from real-world problems or their verbal descriptions -- remain underexplored.
In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating LLMs' abilities to solve
stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems characterized by
uncertainty and typically involving tools from probability, statistics, and
stochastic processes. We manually procure a representative set of
graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs'
abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of
simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to
make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a
nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic
modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on
par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings
highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and
amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.

Conclusion: 工业大脑填补了工业链韧性预测和规划的重要空白，具有鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental
functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management
and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly
challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience
(for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep
learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction
of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network
topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in
real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial
brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework
integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic
reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of
global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure
of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying
assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but
also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning.
Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms
resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up
to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension
reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains
robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest
that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and
planning for industrial chain.

Abstract: Increasingly multi-purpose AI models, such as cutting-edge large language
models or other 'general-purpose AI' (GPAI) models, 'foundation models,'
generative AI models, and 'frontier models' (typically all referred to
hereafter with the umbrella term 'GPAI/foundation models' except where greater
specificity is needed), can provide many beneficial capabilities but also risks
of adverse events with profound consequences. This document provides
risk-management practices or controls for identifying, analyzing, and
mitigating risks of GPAI/foundation models. We intend this document primarily
for developers of large-scale, state-of-the-art GPAI/foundation models; others
that can benefit from this guidance include downstream developers of end-use
applications that build on a GPAI/foundation model. This document facilitates
conformity with or use of leading AI risk management-related standards,
adapting and building on the generic voluntary guidance in the NIST AI Risk
Management Framework and ISO/IEC 23894, with a focus on the unique issues faced
by developers of GPAI/foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法全面评估决策算法处理非马尔可夫动态的能力，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 通过范畴论建立了MDP和NMDP的范畴，并证明其等价性；引入HAS工具控制状态依赖结构。

Result: 方法能有效表示广泛的非马尔可夫动态，为决策算法提供了更严格的评估框架。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解和解决非马尔可夫动态提供了新视角，并提升了决策算法的评估灵活性。

Abstract: In the domain of algorithmic decision-making, non-Markovian dynamics manifest
as a significant impediment, especially for paradigms such as Reinforcement
Learning (RL), thereby exerting far-reaching consequences on the advancement
and effectiveness of the associated systems. Nevertheless, the existing
benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision
algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we
have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we
established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of
non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence
relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel
perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further
introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the
History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the
state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our
analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad
range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and
flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings
where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPIRAL是一个自博弈框架，通过多轮零和游戏训练语言模型，无需人工监督，生成渐进式挑战问题，提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖人工标注和特定领域奖励工程，SPIRAL旨在通过自博弈消除这些限制，实现自主推理发展。

Method: 采用多轮、多智能体强化学习系统，提出角色条件优势估计（RAE）稳定训练，通过零和游戏自博弈生成无限课程。

Result: 在Kuhn Poker上训练的模型在数学和通用推理任务上分别提升8.6%和8.4%，多游戏训练进一步增强性能。

Conclusion: 零和游戏能自然发展可迁移的推理能力，为自主推理发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can
develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable
rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and
domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework
where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously
improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.
Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively
challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To
enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,
multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose
role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.
Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that
transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%
improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000
expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through
three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,
and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple
Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct
reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model
(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These
results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable
reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous
reasoning development.

### [83] [Robust Perspective Correction for Real-World Crack Evolution Tracking in Image-Based Structural Health Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22437)
*Xinxin Sun,Peter Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的图像对齐框架，用于结构健康监测中的裂缝演化跟踪，解决了传统方法在高频边缘抑制和重复性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征检测方法（如SIFT、SURF）在高频边缘抑制和复杂环境下表现不佳，轻量级方法（如ORB、BRISK）在纹理或阴影表面重复性差。

Method: 利用非线性各向异性扩散构建保留裂缝的尺度空间，结合RANSAC单应性估计，无需训练或参数调整。

Result: 在多种现场条件下，裂缝面积和长度误差分别减少70%和90%，对齐误差低于5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为裂缝演化跟踪提供了一种鲁棒、轻量且无需校准的解决方案，适用于移动平台和无人机部署。

Abstract: Accurate image alignment is essential for monitoring crack evolution in
structural health monitoring (SHM), particularly under real-world conditions
involving perspective distortion, occlusion, and low contrast. However,
traditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on
Gaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them
unsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like
ORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint
repeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a
physics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to
SHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to
construct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based
homography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction
without the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The
method is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via
handheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow
interference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared
to classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine
length errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while
maintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,
interpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable
deployment via UAVs and mobile platforms. By tailoring nonlinear scale-space
modeling to SHM image alignment, this work offers a robust and physically
grounded alternative to conventional techniques for tracking real-world crack
evolution.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于计数结果和外部环境条件信息的方法，用于全面评估图像中害虫计数的置信度，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的害虫计数研究在真实场景中缺乏对计数结果可靠性的评估，因此需要一种方法来全面评估计数置信度。

Method: 结合害虫检测网络、图像质量评估、图像复杂性评估和害虫分布均匀性评估，设计回归模型预测计数置信度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在害虫计数置信度测试集上比基线方法降低了31.7%的MSE，提高了15.2%的R2。

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面评估了计数任务的置信度，并通过模型量化了影响因素与计数置信度之间的关系。

Abstract: Accurate pest population monitoring and tracking their dynamic changes are
crucial for precision agriculture decision-making. A common limitation in
existing vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are
typically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world
scenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack
of ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively
evaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related
to counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest
detection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting
result-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality
assessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity
assessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image
acquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.
Notably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis
method to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity
assessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for
pest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information
related to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into
a regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting
confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to
comprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and
quantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting
confidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by
31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,
compared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting
results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的高计算成本是主要瓶颈，现有加速技术（如缓存和量化）在计算误差和生成质量上存在局限。

Method: 提出Modulated Diffusion（MoDiff）框架，结合调制量化和误差补偿，适用于所有扩散模型。

Result: MoDiff将激活量化从8位降至3位，且在CIFAR-10和LSUN上无性能损失。

Conclusion: MoDiff是一种高效且通用的扩散模型加速方法，理论分析和实验验证了其优势。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high
computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In
this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art
acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and
quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation
quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion
(MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates
generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation.
MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization
methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion
models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and
analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate
that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits
without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code
implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过低成本负载传感器和图像融合技术，ViFusionTST模型能有效预测患者离床意图，提升跌倒预防效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院和长期护理机构中，床旁跌倒是一个主要伤害来源，现有警报系统反应滞后。

Method: 使用四个低成本负载传感器，将信号转换为互补图像（RGB线图和纹理图），并通过双流Swin Transformer（ViFusionTST）进行并行处理和跨模态融合。

Result: 在真实数据集上，ViFusionTST达到0.885的准确率和0.794的F1分数，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 基于图像融合的负载信号分类方法是一种实用且有效的实时跌倒预防解决方案。

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and
long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a
patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be
predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The
resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary
images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps -
recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that
expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin
Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses
them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.
  To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data
from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset
ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing
recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.
The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time
series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time,
privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Motivation: 传统本地传感器数据稀疏，卫星图像能提供更全面的城市交通信息，克服数据可用性限制。

Method: 设计计算机视觉流程提取车辆类别信息，构建计算图模型联合校准交通计数和旅行时间。

Result: 实验表明，卫星数据显著提升估计性能，尤其适用于无本地传感器的路段，且框架可扩展至大规模网络。

Conclusion: 该框架具有实际部署潜力，适用于不同规模城市，数据质量对卫星图像影响需进一步分析。

Abstract: This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic
origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network
models, leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional
traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite
imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both
parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To
extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for
class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level
traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,
we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic
network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times
from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To
assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a
series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The
results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data
with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance,
especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm
the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its
potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity
analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite
imagery data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在手术室风险检测中视觉-语义知识冲突（VS-KC）的方法，通过生成合成图像数据集OR-VSKC，并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术风险识别对患者安全至关重要，但现有MLLMs存在视觉-语义知识冲突，无法有效检测视觉安全违规。

Method: 生成包含34,000张合成图像的数据集OR-VSKC，涵盖手术室场景中的安全违规实体，并辅以214张人工标注图像作为验证基准。通过微调MLLMs研究VS-KC。

Result: 微调后的MLLMs在训练过的冲突实体检测上表现显著提升，但对未训练实体类型效果不佳。

Conclusion: OR-VSKC数据集和基准测试为研究VS-KC提供了资源，但需更全面的训练以提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing
preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit
visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety
violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a
dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models,
depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established
safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine
MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated
images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This
comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and
configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC
significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and
generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on
untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the
need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include:
(1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2)
the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source
resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge
consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at

Abstract: Remote sensing datasets offer significant promise for tackling key
classification tasks such as land-use categorization, object presence
detection, and rural/urban classification. However, many existing studies tend
to focus on narrow tasks or datasets, which limits their ability to generalize
across various remote sensing classification challenges. To overcome this, we
propose a novel model, SpatialNet-ViT, leveraging the power of Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL). This integrated approach
combines spatial awareness with contextual understanding, improving both
classification accuracy and scalability. Additionally, techniques like data
augmentation, transfer learning, and multi-task learning are employed to
enhance model robustness and its ability to generalize across diverse datasets

Conclusion: 三维姿态数据为足球盘带分析提供了更丰富的视角，显著优于传统二维方法。

Abstract: Data analysis plays an increasingly important role in soccer, offering new
ways to evaluate individual and team performance. One specific application is
the evaluation of dribbles: one-on-one situations where an attacker attempts to
bypass a defender with the ball. While previous research has primarily relied
on 2D positional tracking data, this fails to capture aspects like balance,
orientation, and ball control, limiting the depth of current insights. This
study explores how pose tracking data (capturing players' posture and movement
in three dimensions) can improve our understanding of dribbling skills. We
extract novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions
League season and evaluate their impact on dribble success. Our results
indicate that features capturing the attacker's balance and the alignment of
the orientation between the attacker and defender are informative for
predicting dribble success. Incorporating these pose-based features on top of
features derived from traditional 2D positional data leads to a measurable
improvement in model performance.

Abstract: Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of
abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from
computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with
machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While
supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new
unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from
structural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its
spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal
patches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the
location prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into
pixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the
ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach
to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021
and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show
that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging
in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic
aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain,
obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose
a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation
using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an
object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more
quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the
segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create
realistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a
contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose
to first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create
counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source
backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the
training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the
real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a
supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could
provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments
on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds
compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested
on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to
natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids
pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics. The basecode

Abstract: Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which
enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen
domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction
(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth
exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution
transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a
training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.
Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise
statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in
conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise
prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise
Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics
to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving
domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we
directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the
noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the
more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions
closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of
sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions
progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling
process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA
capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究利用生成扩散模型，基于FY4B卫星的多波段热红外数据，开发了RefDiff模型，实现了夜间可见光反射率的高精度反演，显著提升了复杂云结构区域的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决夜间因缺乏可见光而无法进行全天候气象观测的问题。

Method: 基于FY4B卫星的AGRI多波段热红外数据，开发生成扩散模型RefDiff，实现夜间可见光反射率反演。

Result: RefDiff的SSIM指数达0.90，在复杂云结构区域表现优异，夜间反演能力与白天相当。

Conclusion: 该研究显著提升了夜间可见光反射率反演能力，拓展了夜间可见光数据的应用潜力。

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial
for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather
monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night,
it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using
visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative
diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal
infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation
Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we
developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called
Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m},
0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance
retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only
significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides
uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,
with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud
structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was
validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance
to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial
progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with
the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Motivation: 解决现有信息不足的问题，优化虚拟缺陷增强技术，并验证框架的实用性。

Method: 收集并分类223张飞机焊缝的CR照片，使用数据增强技术（如虚拟缺陷增强）改进数据集，训练改进的U-net模型进行语义缺陷分割。

Result: 模型在缺陷检测中表现出高灵敏度，尤其在a90/95特征下表现优异，且处理速度快。

Conclusion: 该框架在专业评估中显示出作为检测支持工具的潜力，不受特定设备限制影响。

Abstract: This investigation attempts to create an automated framework for fault
detection and organization for usage in contemporary radiography, as per NDE
4.0. The review's goals are to address the lack of information that is
sufficiently explained, learn how to make the most of virtual defect increase,
and determine whether the framework is viable by using NDE measurements. As its
basic information source, the technique consists of compiling and categorizing
223 CR photographs of airplane welds. Information expansion systems, such as
virtual defect increase and standard increase, are used to work on the
preparation dataset. A modified U-net model is prepared using the improved data
to produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the
model, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call
rate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong
differentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves
exceptional awareness in defect detection. Considering a 90/95, size error, and
fake call rate in the weld area, the consolidated expansion approach clearly
wins. Due to the framework's fast derivation speed, large images can be broken
down efficiently and quickly. Professional controllers evaluate the transmitted
system in the field and believe that it has a guarantee as a support device in
the testing cycle, irrespective of particular equipment cut-off points and
programming resemblance.

Motivation: 集装箱损伤是物流行业的安全隐患，需及时检测以延长使用寿命和避免风险。

Method: 使用278张标注图像数据集训练和测试三种模型，比较mAP和精度。

Result: Yolov11和12的mAP@50为81.9%，RF-DETR为77.7%，但RF-DETR在不常见损伤检测中表现更优。

Conclusion: RF-DETR在不常见损伤检测中更具优势，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Containers are an integral part of the logistics industry and act as a
barrier for cargo. A typical service life for a container is more than 20
years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the
mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard
for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company.
Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key
for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper,
we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three
state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR.
We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the
model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of
this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage
detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9%
compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for
not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others
overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers
as well as damage occurrences with high confidence.

*Prasen Kumar Sharma,Neeraj Matiyali,Siddharth Srivastava,Gaurav Sharma*

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“Preserve Anything”的新方法，用于解决文本到图像生成中的对象保存和语义一致性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保存多个对象、语义对齐和场景控制方面存在不足。

Method: 采用N通道ControlNet，结合对象保存、背景引导和高频覆盖模块。

Result: 在FID和CLIP-S指标上表现优异，用户研究显示显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在对象保存、语义一致性和用户控制方面优于现有技术。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Preserve Anything}, a novel method for controlled image
synthesis that addresses key limitations in object preservation and semantic
consistency in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Existing approaches often fail
(i) to preserve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semantic
alignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control over scene
composition. To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an
N-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and
placement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination,
(ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate
shadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over
background layouts and lighting conditions. Key components of our framework
include object preservation and background guidance modules, enforcing lighting
consistency and a high-frequency overlay module to retain fine details while
mitigating unwanted artifacts. We introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of
240K natural images filtered for aesthetic quality and 18K 3D-rendered
synthetic images with metadata such as lighting, camera angles, and object
relationships. This dataset addresses the deficiencies of existing benchmarks
and allows a complete evaluation. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving feature-space
fidelity (FID 15.26) and semantic alignment (CLIP-S 32.85) while maintaining
competitive aesthetic quality. We also conducted a user study to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed work on unseen benchmark and observed a remarkable
improvement of $\sim25\%$, $\sim19\%$, $\sim13\%$, and $\sim14\%$ in terms of
prompt alignment, photorealism, the presence of AI artifacts, and natural
aesthetics over existing works.

Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal
signals, essential for conveying meaning and achieving interpersonal goals. To
develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models
that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end,
we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over
4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in
diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that
understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,
telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also
develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion
gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can
take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We
present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D
rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.
Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can
adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more
semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the
quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential
for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.

TL;DR: 论文改进了Pix2Seq目标检测器，将其扩展到视频领域，提出了一种新的端到端视频目标检测方法，解决了传统检测器的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频目标检测方法存在训练稀疏性和后处理启发式问题，且通常通过链接2D框构建视频对象，效率较低。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过将对象表示为离散标记的可变长度序列，无需定位线索训练；将视频对象视为不可分割的3D框或轨迹，而非链接2D框。

Result: 在多个数据集上优于Pix2Seq静态检测器，并在UA-DETRAC上与当前最先进方法竞争，尽管受限于计算资源。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在视频目标检测中表现优异，解决了传统方法的局限性，但计算资源是主要瓶颈。

Abstract: This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for
videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video
object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.
First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,
we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with
diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in
the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all
possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual
problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing
during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as
fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating
image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video
object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale
effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the
length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even
generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire
video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector
on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with
strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We
also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is
competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational
bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

TL;DR: MMKD-CLIP通过多教师知识蒸馏构建高性能生物医学基础模型，解决了数据稀缺和异构性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域缺乏大规模图像-文本数据，且数据标准和模态多样，阻碍了通用基础模型的开发。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在290万生物医学图像-文本对上预训练，然后从9个教师模型中蒸馏1920万特征对。

Result: 在58个数据集上评估，涵盖1080万图像和9种模态，MMKD-CLIP在所有任务中均优于教师模型。

Conclusion: 多教师知识蒸馏是构建高性能生物医学基础模型的有效方法。

Abstract: CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs
have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification,
cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring
this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale
biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and
fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the
development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained
from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical
foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.
Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge
from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP
models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our
two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9
million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by
feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from
teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,
encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.
The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear
probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,
and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models
while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image
domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher
knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building
high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of
real-world data availability.

Abstract: Agricultural image semantic segmentation is a pivotal component of modern
agriculture, facilitating accurate visual data analysis to improve crop
management, optimize resource utilization, and boost overall productivity. This
study proposes an efficient image segmentation method for precision
agriculture, focusing on accurately delineating farmland anomalies to support
informed decision-making and proactive interventions. A novel Dual Atrous
Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module is integrated within the
DeepLabV3-based segmentation framework. The DAS Conv module is meticulously
designed to achieve an optimal balance between dilation rates and padding size,
thereby enhancing model performance without compromising efficiency. The study
also incorporates a strategic skip connection from an optimal stage in the
encoder to the decoder to bolster the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
spatial features. Despite its lower computational complexity, the proposed
model outperforms its baseline and achieves performance comparable to highly
complex transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Agriculture
Vision benchmark dataset. It achieves more than 66% improvement in efficiency
when considering the trade-off between model complexity and performance,
compared to the SOTA model. This study highlights an efficient and effective
solution for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications,
offering a computationally lightweight model capable of high-quality
performance in agricultural imagery.

Result: 在ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText竞赛数据上，LIGHT表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多模态学习能有效提升历史地图文本链接的准确性。

Abstract: Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history,
economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or
semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,
reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and
transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the
recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing
layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding
in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and
neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To
address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that
integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on
historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding
module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture
polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies
this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from
LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal
information to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance
directly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence
robustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods
on the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data, demonstrating the
effectiveness of multi-modal learning for historical map text linking.

Result: 在UKBioBank和Human Connectome Project数据集上，BrainMT在分类（性别预测）和回归（认知预测）任务中表现最优。

Conclusion: BrainMT通过高效学习长距离时空属性，显著优于现有方法，代码将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic
measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain
volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However,
existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or
transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships
inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial
and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate
long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in
two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning
mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally
efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to
model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the
Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,
UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and
regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing
methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be
made publicly available at this

Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习提升大型多模态模型在像素级任务（如前景分割）中的理解和推理能力。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)策略，通过点提示和边界框提示引导SAM2生成分割掩码，仅使用RL训练。

Conclusion: Seg-R1证明了纯RL训练在像素级任务中的有效性，并展示了强大的开放世界泛化能力。

Abstract: We present Seg-R1, a preliminary exploration of using reinforcement learning
(RL) to enhance the pixel-level understanding and reasoning capabilities of
large multimodal models (LMMs). Starting with foreground segmentation tasks,
specifically camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection
(SOD), our approach enables the LMM to generate point and bounding box prompts
in the next-token fashion, which are then used to guide SAM2 in producing
segmentation masks. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into
the segmentation domain, equipping the LMM with pixel-level comprehension
through a carefully designed training strategy. Notably, Seg-R1 achieves
remarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure
on COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL
training demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained
solely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision,
Seg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and
reasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on
ReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.

Motivation: VLMs在视觉和语言数据整合中表现出色，但存在幻觉问题，即生成与视觉输入不符的文本。研究发现这是由于模型对语言的过度依赖导致的“记忆衰减效应”。

Method: 提出了一种名为ReCo的小型可训练模块，无需修改现有VLM结构，利用几何代数和关系组合来控制幻觉行为。

Result: 在InstructBLIP、LlaVA和MiniGPT4三种主流VLM上测试，ReCo模块显著减轻了记忆衰减效应，并在多个基准测试中提升了性能。此外，ReCo还能与其他减少幻觉的方法结合，进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: ReCo模块是一种简单有效的解决方案，能够显著改善VLMs的幻觉问题，且兼容性强，可与其他方法结合使用。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and
reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A
common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e.,
generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or
at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an
over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model
suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual
input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled.
Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions,
we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any
VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module
is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used
VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on
multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with
many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve
improved results for each one.

Abstract: The recent introduction of diffusion models in dataset distillation has shown
promising potential in creating compact surrogate datasets for large,
high-resolution target datasets, offering improved efficiency and performance
over traditional bi-level/uni-level optimization methods. However, current
diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process
and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1)
Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the
evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches
between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these
issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided
Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the
distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a
probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines
the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood.
CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets,
surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.

Motivation: 现有IDE-BSR方法忽视了IDR区分性的重要性，且模型复杂度过高。本文旨在优化IDR区分性，设计轻量高效的BSR模型。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏框架，结合退化先验约束的对比学习（教师阶段）和特征对齐技术（学生阶段），提升IDR区分性并简化模型。

Result: 实验表明，LightBSR在多种盲超分辨率任务中表现优异，且计算复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: 优化IDR区分性是提升盲超分辨率性能的关键，LightBSR为轻量高效BSR模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Implicit degradation estimation-based blind super-resolution (IDE-BSR) hinges
on extracting the implicit degradation representation (IDR) of the LR image and
adapting it to LR image features to guide HR detail restoration. Although
IDE-BSR has shown potential in dealing with noise interference and complex
degradations, existing methods ignore the importance of IDR discriminability
for BSR and instead over-complicate the adaptation process to improve effect,
resulting in a significant increase in the model's parameters and computations.
In this paper, we focus on the discriminability optimization of IDR and propose
a new powerful and lightweight BSR model termed LightBSR. Specifically, we
employ a knowledge distillation-based learning framework. We first introduce a
well-designed degradation-prior-constrained contrastive learning technique
during teacher stage to make the model more focused on distinguishing different
degradation types. Then we utilize a feature alignment technique to transfer
the degradation-related knowledge acquired by the teacher to the student for
practical inferencing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
IDR discriminability-driven BSR model design. The proposed LightBSR can achieve
outstanding performance with minimal complexity across a range of blind SR
tasks. Our code is accessible at: https://github.com/MJ-NCEPU/LightBSR.

TL;DR: 提出一种联合解决部分分割和运动估计的方法，通过3D高斯表示处理动态点云序列，适用于遮挡和多传感器异步采集场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态点云序列中部分分割和运动估计的挑战，特别是在点云非固定采样或存在遮挡的情况下。

Method: 使用3D高斯模型表示物体，参数化时间依赖的旋转、平移和缩放，通过点与高斯的对应关系实现分割和运动估计。

Result: 在遮挡场景下，部分分割性能优于现有方法13%，且对缺失点更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态点云分析中表现优异，尤其在复杂场景下具有显著优势。

Abstract: Part segmentation and motion estimation are two fundamental problems for
articulated object motion analysis. In this paper, we present a method to solve
these two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single
articulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point
clouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.
Instead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the
object surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the
object undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using
measurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods
that rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an
alternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we
represent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D
Gaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,
translations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our
representation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences
between the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of
each point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned
Gaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our
method outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point
correspondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate
real-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further
demonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to
existing approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are
completely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation
performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with
occlusions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种确定性方法，用于估计6D姿态置信区域，解决了采样方法的速度和区域过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于采样的方法在速度和置信区域大小上存在显著限制，影响了实际应用。

Method: 使用归纳共形预测校准高斯关键点分布，并通过隐函数定理直接传播到6D姿态置信区域。

Result: 在LineMOD Occlusion和SPEED数据集上，方法提高了姿态估计精度，减少了计算时间，置信区域体积显著缩小。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且紧凑，能以用户定义的置信水平覆盖真实姿态，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: 6D pose confidence region estimation has emerged as a critical direction,
aiming to perform uncertainty quantification for assessing the reliability of
estimated poses. However, current sampling-based approach suffers from critical
limitations that severely impede their practical deployment: 1) the sampling
speed significantly decreases as the number of samples increases. 2) the
derived confidence regions are often excessively large. To address these
challenges, we propose a deterministic and efficient method for estimating pose
confidence regions. Our approach uses inductive conformal prediction to
calibrate the deterministically regressed Gaussian keypoint distributions into
2D keypoint confidence regions. We then leverage the implicit function theorem
to propagate these keypoint confidence regions directly into 6D pose confidence
regions. This method avoids the inefficiency and inflated region sizes
associated with sampling and ensembling. It provides compact confidence regions
that cover the ground-truth poses with a user-defined confidence level.
Experimental results on the LineMOD Occlusion and SPEED datasets show that our
method achieves higher pose estimation accuracy with reduced computational
time. For the same coverage rate, our method yields significantly smaller
confidence region volumes, reducing them by up to 99.9\% for rotations and
99.8\% for translations. The code will be available soon.

Result: XTransfer在多种人类感知任务中表现优异，显著降低了数据收集、模型训练和边缘部署的成本。

Conclusion: XTransfer为边缘系统中的人类感知任务提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant
opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are
hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of
edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models
often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands,
resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor
adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose
XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic
model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained
models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model
repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with
only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and
recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to
create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human
sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results
demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human
sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection,
model training, and edge deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态医学图像融合方法依赖于高质量和对齐良好的输入图像，但在处理未对齐或质量差的图像时效果不佳。

Method: UniFuse通过降解感知提示学习模块、Omni统一特征表示方案和通用特征恢复与融合模块（ALSN），实现了对齐、恢复和融合的联合优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，UniFuse在多个数据集上优于现有方法，具有显著优势。

Conclusion: UniFuse通过一体化框架解决了多模态医学图像融合中的对齐和恢复问题，为相关领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current multimodal medical image fusion typically assumes that source images
are of high quality and perfectly aligned at the pixel level. Its effectiveness
heavily relies on these conditions and often deteriorates when handling
misaligned or degraded medical images. To address this, we propose UniFuse, a
general fusion framework. By embedding a degradation-aware prompt learning
module, UniFuse seamlessly integrates multi-directional information from input
images and correlates cross-modal alignment with restoration, enabling joint
optimization of both tasks within a unified framework. Additionally, we design
an Omni Unified Feature Representation scheme, which leverages Spatial Mamba to
encode multi-directional features and mitigate modality differences in feature
alignment. To enable simultaneous restoration and fusion within an All-in-One
configuration, we propose a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module,
incorporating the Adaptive LoRA Synergistic Network (ALSN) based on LoRA
principles. By leveraging ALSN's adaptive feature representation along with
degradation-type guidance, we enable joint restoration and fusion within a
single-stage framework. Compared to staged approaches, UniFuse unifies
alignment, restoration, and fusion within a single framework. Experimental
results across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and
significant advantages over existing approaches.

Result: 实验结果显示，JGAU在4倍、8倍、12倍和16倍上采样率下的PSNR分别为33.90、32.10、31.10和30.39分贝，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JGAU方法在彩色点云上采样任务中表现出显著优势，为3D应用提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Colored point cloud, which includes geometry and attribute components, is a
mainstream representation enabling realistic and immersive 3D applications. To
generate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep
learning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that
learns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial
attribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset
for colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121
large-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute
complexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve
the quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU
framework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a
geometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the
latter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood
correlations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute
up-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation
(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate
coarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement
module is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce
high-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and
geometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10
decibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,
8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, JGAU achieves average PSNR gains of 2.32 decibels, 2.47 decibels, 2.28
decibels, and 2.11 decibels at these four up-sampling rates, demonstrating
significant improvement.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于现有技术，实现了高保真和清晰的图像重建。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自然图像先验和可控推理，有效解决了金属透镜摄影中的退化问题，并展示了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational
imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational
restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical
calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world
imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process
often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce
Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography,
leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of
large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths
to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and
suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \textit{pseudo} data
augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity
and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware
attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced
degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for
real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image
reconstruction. More materials: https://dmdiff.github.io/.

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了NCA在高分辨率下的质量和效率，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical
cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly
applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including
self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and
spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and
morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This
limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow
quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information
which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands
of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this
limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by
recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on
a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary
resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and
texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with
minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture
and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and
performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD
outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent
properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,
inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,
and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and
morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed
framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal
computational overhead.

Abstract: The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen
significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse
environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world
demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing
simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the
challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges,
we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic
manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the
construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration
videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various
object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic
Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by
incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation
production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command
interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for
performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we
conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including
RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which
demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.

Abstract: Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks.
To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results.
However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers
struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long
sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence
modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we
propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution
framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces
Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract
long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently.
To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment
module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the
compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions.
Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and
ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency
Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances
visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art
results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for
future research.

Conclusion: PF攻击和检测模型为DF攻击提供了更现实的模拟和高效检测方案。

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) attacks pose a growing threat as generative models become
increasingly advanced. However, our study reveals that existing DF datasets
fail to deceive human perception, unlike real DF attacks that influence public
discourse. It highlights the need for more realistic DF attack vectors. We
introduce PhonemeFake (PF), a DF attack that manipulates critical speech
segments using language reasoning, significantly reducing human perception by
up to 42% and benchmark accuracies by up to 94%. We release an easy-to-use PF
dataset on HuggingFace and open-source bilevel DF segment detection model that
adaptively prioritizes compute on manipulated regions. Our extensive
experiments across three known DF datasets reveal that our detection model
reduces EER by 91% while achieving up to 90% speed-up, with minimal compute
overhead and precise localization beyond existing models as a scalable
solution.

*Aradhana Mishra,Bumshik Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelBoost是一种新型扩散模型，通过引入布朗运动的随机性提升图像超分辨率，在保持计算效率的同时生成更真实的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的超分辨率技术常面临生成图像真实性与计算效率的权衡问题，尤其在减少采样步骤时图像质量下降。

Method: 通过将受控随机性引入训练过程，避免局部最优，并采用Sigmoid噪声序列方法简化训练。

Result: 在LPIPS、LOE、PSNR、SSIM等指标上表现优异，边缘重建能力更强，且具有自适应学习能力。

Conclusion: PixelBoost在图像超分辨率中实现了高真实性和高效性的平衡，尤其在纹理和边缘定义方面表现突出。

Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a
trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This
issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps,
resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the
significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing
image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly
focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled
stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence
to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty
of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior
objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity
(LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR),
structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To
determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel
value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction
capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities
by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal
noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference
speeds.

### [123] [Robust Perspective Correction for Real-World Crack Evolution Tracking in Image-Based Structural Health Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22437)
*Xinxin Sun,Peter Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的图像对齐框架，针对结构健康监测中的裂纹定位问题，通过非线性各向异性扩散和RANSAC算法实现高精度对齐，显著降低了裂纹定位误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征检测方法（如SIFT、SURF）在高频边缘抑制和纹理复杂场景下表现不佳，而轻量级方法（如ORB、BRISK）在重复性上存在问题，因此需要一种适应复杂环境的高精度裂纹定位方法。

Method: 采用非线性各向异性扩散构建裂纹保留的尺度空间，结合RANSAC算法进行单应性估计，无需训练或参数调优。

Result: 在多种复杂条件下，裂纹面积和长度误差分别降低70%和90%，对齐误差保持在5%以下。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构健康监测提供了一种无监督、轻量级且物理基础扎实的裂纹定位解决方案，适用于移动平台部署。

Abstract: Accurate image alignment is essential for monitoring crack evolution in
structural health monitoring (SHM), particularly under real-world conditions
involving perspective distortion, occlusion, and low contrast. However,
traditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on
Gaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them
unsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like
ORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint
repeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a
physics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to
SHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to
construct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based
homography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction
without the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The
method is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via
handheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow
interference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared
to classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine
length errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while
maintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,
interpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable
deployment via UAVs and mobile platforms. By tailoring nonlinear scale-space
modeling to SHM image alignment, this work offers a robust and physically
grounded alternative to conventional techniques for tracking real-world crack
evolution.

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面评估了计数任务的置信度，并通过模型量化了影响因素与置信度的关系，为精准农业决策提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Accurate pest population monitoring and tracking their dynamic changes are
crucial for precision agriculture decision-making. A common limitation in
existing vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are
typically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world
scenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack
of ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively
evaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related
to counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest
detection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting
result-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality
assessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity
assessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image
acquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.
Notably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis
method to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity
assessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for
pest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information
related to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into
a regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting
confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to
comprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and
quantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting
confidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by
31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,
compared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting
results.

Conclusion: MoDiff 是一种高效且通用的扩散模型加速方法，具有理论支持和实验验证。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high
computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In
this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art
acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and
quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation
quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion
(MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates
generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation.
MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization
methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion
models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and
analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate
that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits
without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code
implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

TL;DR: 通过低成本负载传感器和图像融合技术，ViFusionTST模型能提前预测患者离床意图，有效预防跌倒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院和长期护理设施中，床相关跌倒事故频发，现有警报系统反应滞后，需提前预测离床意图。

Method: 使用四个低成本负载传感器采集数据，转换为RGB线图和纹理图，通过双流Swin Transformer（ViFusionTST）进行并行处理和跨模态融合。

Result: 在真实数据集上，ViFusionTST达到0.885的准确率和0.794的F1分数，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 基于图像融合的负载信号分类方法实用有效，适用于实时、隐私保护的跌倒预防。

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and
long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a
patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be
predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The
resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary
images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps -
recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that
expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin
Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses
them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.
  To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data
from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset
ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing
recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.
The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time
series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time,
privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Conclusion: 该框架具有实际部署潜力，适用于不同规模的城市，卫星数据质量对结果有显著影响。

Abstract: This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic
origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network
models, leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional
traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite
imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both
parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To
extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for
class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level
traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,
we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic
network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times
from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To
assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a
series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The
results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data
with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance,
especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm
the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its
potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity
analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite
imagery data.

Motivation: 手术风险识别对患者安全和减少可预防医疗错误至关重要，但现有模型在视觉安全违规识别上存在不足。

Method: 通过生成34,000张合成图像和214张人工标注图像构建数据集，并用于微调模型。

Result: 微调后模型在训练过的冲突实体上表现显著提升，但对未训练实体类型效果不佳。

Conclusion: OR-VSKC数据集为研究视觉-语义知识冲突提供了资源，并揭示了模型学习的局限性。

Abstract: Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing
preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit
visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety
violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a
dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models,
depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established
safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine
MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated
images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This
comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and
configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC
significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and
generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on
untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the
need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include:
(1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2)
the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source
resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge
consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at

Abstract: Remote sensing datasets offer significant promise for tackling key
classification tasks such as land-use categorization, object presence

propose a novel model, SpatialNet-ViT, leveraging the power of Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL). This integrated approach
combines spatial awareness with contextual understanding, improving both
classification accuracy and scalability. Additionally, techniques like data
augmentation, transfer learning, and multi-task learning are employed to
enhance model robustness and its ability to generalize across diverse datasets

Abstract: Data analysis plays an increasingly important role in soccer, offering new
ways to evaluate individual and team performance. One specific application is
the evaluation of dribbles: one-on-one situations where an attacker attempts to
bypass a defender with the ball. While previous research has primarily relied
on 2D positional tracking data, this fails to capture aspects like balance,
orientation, and ball control, limiting the depth of current insights. This
study explores how pose tracking data (capturing players' posture and movement
in three dimensions) can improve our understanding of dribbling skills. We
extract novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions
League season and evaluate their impact on dribble success. Our results
indicate that features capturing the attacker's balance and the alignment of
the orientation between the attacker and defender are informative for
predicting dribble success. Incorporating these pose-based features on top of
features derived from traditional 2D positional data leads to a measurable
improvement in model performance.

Abstract: Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of
abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from
computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with
machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While
supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new
unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from
structural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its
spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal
patches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the
location prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into
pixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the
ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach
to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021
and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show
that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging
in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic
aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain,
obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose
a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation
using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an
object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more
quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the
segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create
realistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a
contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose
to first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create
counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source
backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the
training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the
real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a
supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could
provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments
on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds
compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested
on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to
natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids
pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics. The basecode

Abstract: Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which
enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen
domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction
(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth
exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution
transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a
training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.
Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise
statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in
conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise
prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise
Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics
to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving
domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we
directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the
noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the
more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions
closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of
sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions
progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling
process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA
capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks. Code is

Conclusion: 研究显著提升了夜间可见光反射率反演能力，拓展了夜间可见光数据的应用潜力。

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial
for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather
monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night,
it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using
visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative
diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal
infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation
Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we
developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called
Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m},
0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance
retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only
significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides
uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,
with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud
structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was
validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance
to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial
progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with
the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

to produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the
model, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call
rate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong
differentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves
exceptional awareness in defect detection. Considering a 90/95, size error, and
fake call rate in the weld area, the consolidated expansion approach clearly
wins. Due to the framework's fast derivation speed, large images can be broken
down efficiently and quickly. Professional controllers evaluate the transmitted
system in the field and believe that it has a guarantee as a support device in
the testing cycle, irrespective of particular equipment cut-off points and
programming resemblance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集装箱损伤检测对延长使用寿命和避免安全隐患至关重要，需找到最适合的检测模型。

Method: 使用278张标注图像数据集训练和测试三种模型，比较mAP和精度。

Result: Yolov11和12的mAP@50为81.9%，RF-DETR为77.7%，但RF-DETR在不常见损伤检测中表现更优。

Conclusion: RF-DETR在不常见损伤检测中更具优势，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Containers are an integral part of the logistics industry and act as a
barrier for cargo. A typical service life for a container is more than 20
years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the
mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard
for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company.
Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key
for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper,
we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three
state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR.
We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the
model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of
this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage
detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9%
compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for
not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others
overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers
as well as damage occurrences with high confidence.

*Prasen Kumar Sharma,Neeraj Matiyali,Siddharth Srivastava,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“Preserve Anything”的新方法，用于解决文本到图像生成中的对象保存和语义一致性问题，通过N-channel ControlNet实现高效控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保存多个对象、语义对齐和场景控制方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用N-channel ControlNet，结合对象保存、背景引导和高频覆盖模块，确保细节保留和语义一致性。

Result: 在FID和CLIP-S指标上达到最优性能，用户研究显示在提示对齐、真实感等方面显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在对象保存、语义一致性和用户控制方面表现优异，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Preserve Anything}, a novel method for controlled image
synthesis that addresses key limitations in object preservation and semantic
consistency in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Existing approaches often fail
(i) to preserve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semantic
alignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control over scene
composition. To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an
N-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and
placement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination,
(ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate
shadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over
background layouts and lighting conditions. Key components of our framework
include object preservation and background guidance modules, enforcing lighting
consistency and a high-frequency overlay module to retain fine details while
mitigating unwanted artifacts. We introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of
240K natural images filtered for aesthetic quality and 18K 3D-rendered
synthetic images with metadata such as lighting, camera angles, and object
relationships. This dataset addresses the deficiencies of existing benchmarks
and allows a complete evaluation. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving feature-space
fidelity (FID 15.26) and semantic alignment (CLIP-S 32.85) while maintaining
competitive aesthetic quality. We also conducted a user study to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed work on unseen benchmark and observed a remarkable
improvement of $\sim25\%$, $\sim19\%$, $\sim13\%$, and $\sim14\%$ in terms of
prompt alignment, photorealism, the presence of AI artifacts, and natural
aesthetics over existing works.

Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal
signals, essential for conveying meaning and achieving interpersonal goals. To
develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models
that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end,
we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over
4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in
diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that
understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,
telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also
develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion
gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can
take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We
present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D
rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.
Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can
adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more
semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the
quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential
for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.

TL;DR: 论文改进了Pix2Seq目标检测器，将其扩展到视频领域，提出了一种端到端的视频目标检测新方法，解决了传统检测器的稀疏损失和后处理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频目标检测方法存在稀疏损失和后处理问题，且通常需要将2D框链接为3D对象。本文旨在通过序列化表示和3D框直接输出解决这些问题。

Method: 通过将对象表示为离散标记的可变长度序列，避免定位提示的注入，并直接输出3D框或轨迹，而非链接2D框。

Result: 在多个数据集上优于静态Pix2Seq检测器，并在UA-DETRAC上与当前最优方法竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法在视频目标检测中表现优异，但受限于计算资源，未来可通过扩展计算能力进一步提升性能。

Abstract: This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for
videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video
object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.
First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,
we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with
diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in
the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all
possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual
problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing
during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as
fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating
image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video
object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale
effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the
length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even
generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire
video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector
on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with
strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We
also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is
competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational
bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

TL;DR: MMKD-CLIP通过多教师知识蒸馏构建高性能生物医学基础模型，解决了数据稀缺和异构性问题，在多种任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域缺乏大规模图像-文本数据，且数据模态和标准不统一，阻碍了通用基础模型的开发。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先在290万生物医学图像-文本对上预训练，再从教师模型中提取1920万特征对进行特征级蒸馏。

Result: 在58个数据集上评估，涵盖1080万图像和9种模态，MMKD-CLIP在所有任务中均优于教师模型。

Conclusion: 多教师知识蒸馏是构建高性能生物医学基础模型的有效方法，适应实际数据限制。

Abstract: CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs
have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification,
cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring
this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale
biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and
fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the
development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained
from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical
foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.
Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge
from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP
models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our
two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9
million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by
feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from
teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,
encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.
The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear
probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,
and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models
while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image
domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher
knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building
high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of
real-world data availability.

Conclusion: 提供了一种高效轻量的农业图像分割解决方案，适用于遥感应用。

Abstract: Agricultural image semantic segmentation is a pivotal component of modern
agriculture, facilitating accurate visual data analysis to improve crop
management, optimize resource utilization, and boost overall productivity. This
study proposes an efficient image segmentation method for precision
agriculture, focusing on accurately delineating farmland anomalies to support
informed decision-making and proactive interventions. A novel Dual Atrous
Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module is integrated within the
DeepLabV3-based segmentation framework. The DAS Conv module is meticulously
designed to achieve an optimal balance between dilation rates and padding size,
thereby enhancing model performance without compromising efficiency. The study
also incorporates a strategic skip connection from an optimal stage in the
encoder to the decoder to bolster the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
spatial features. Despite its lower computational complexity, the proposed
model outperforms its baseline and achieves performance comparable to highly
complex transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Agriculture
Vision benchmark dataset. It achieves more than 66% improvement in efficiency
when considering the trade-off between model complexity and performance,
compared to the SOTA model. This study highlights an efficient and effective
solution for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications,
offering a computationally lightweight model capable of high-quality
performance in agricultural imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图上的文本信息对研究至关重要，但现有方法难以有效链接文本片段，尤其是多词地名。

Method: LIGHT通过几何感知嵌入模块编码文本区域的多边形坐标，结合视觉和语言特征，预测文本实例的阅读顺序。

Result: LIGHT在ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition数据上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多模态学习对历史地图文本链接有效，LIGHT展示了其优势。

Abstract: Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history,
economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or
semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,
reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and
transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the
recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing
layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding
in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and
neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To
address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that
integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on
historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding
module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture
polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies
this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from
LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal
information to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance
directly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence
robustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods
on the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data, demonstrating the
effectiveness of multi-modal learning for historical map text linking.

Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉fMRI数据中的长程时空依赖关系，限制了预测性能。

Result: 在UKBioBank和Human Connectome Project数据集上，BrainMT在分类和回归任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: BrainMT通过高效建模fMRI数据的时空特征，显著提升了预测性能，代码将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic
measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain
volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However,
existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or
transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships
inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial
and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate
long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in
two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning
mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally
efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to
model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the
Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,
UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and
regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing
methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be
made publicly available at this

Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习增强大型多模态模型在像素级任务中的理解和推理能力，特别是在前景分割任务中。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）策略，通过点提示和边界框提示引导SAM2生成分割掩码，仅使用RL训练。

Conclusion: Seg-R1展示了纯RL训练在像素级任务中的潜力，无需文本监督即可实现优异的开放世界泛化能力。

Abstract: We present Seg-R1, a preliminary exploration of using reinforcement learning
(RL) to enhance the pixel-level understanding and reasoning capabilities of
large multimodal models (LMMs). Starting with foreground segmentation tasks,
specifically camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection
(SOD), our approach enables the LMM to generate point and bounding box prompts
in the next-token fashion, which are then used to guide SAM2 in producing
segmentation masks. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into
the segmentation domain, equipping the LMM with pixel-level comprehension
through a carefully designed training strategy. Notably, Seg-R1 achieves
remarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure
on COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL
training demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained
solely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision,
Seg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and
reasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on
ReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在生成文本时容易产生幻觉，即生成与视觉输入无关或矛盾的文本。这种问题源于模型对语言的过度依赖和视觉输入的“记忆衰退效应”。

Method: 提出了一种基于几何代数和关系组合的小型可训练模块ReCo，无需修改现有VLM结构，直接应用于模型顶部。

Result: 在三种主流VLM（InstructBLIP、LlaVA、MiniGPT4）上验证了ReCo模块的有效性，显著减少了幻觉问题，并在多个基准测试中提升了性能。

Conclusion: ReCo模块是一种轻量且通用的解决方案，能够有效缓解VLM的幻觉问题，并可与其他减少幻觉的方法结合使用，进一步提升效果。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and
reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A
common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e.,
generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or
at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an
over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model
suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual
input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled.
Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions,
we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any
VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module
is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used
VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on
multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with
many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve
improved results for each one.

Conclusion: CaO$_2$有效解决了不一致问题，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: The recent introduction of diffusion models in dataset distillation has shown
promising potential in creating compact surrogate datasets for large,
high-resolution target datasets, offering improved efficiency and performance
over traditional bi-level/uni-level optimization methods. However, current
diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process
and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1)
Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the
evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches
between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these
issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided
Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the
distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a
probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines
the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood.
CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets,
surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.

Result: LightBSR在多种盲超分辨率任务中表现出色，且模型复杂度极低。

Conclusion: 优化IDR区分性可显著提升盲超分辨率模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: Implicit degradation estimation-based blind super-resolution (IDE-BSR) hinges
on extracting the implicit degradation representation (IDR) of the LR image and
adapting it to LR image features to guide HR detail restoration. Although
IDE-BSR has shown potential in dealing with noise interference and complex
degradations, existing methods ignore the importance of IDR discriminability
for BSR and instead over-complicate the adaptation process to improve effect,
resulting in a significant increase in the model's parameters and computations.
In this paper, we focus on the discriminability optimization of IDR and propose
a new powerful and lightweight BSR model termed LightBSR. Specifically, we
employ a knowledge distillation-based learning framework. We first introduce a
well-designed degradation-prior-constrained contrastive learning technique
during teacher stage to make the model more focused on distinguishing different
degradation types. Then we utilize a feature alignment technique to transfer

TL;DR: 提出一种联合解决部分分割和运动估计的方法，通过3D高斯模型表示物体，适用于点云数据动态采样的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态点云数据中部分分割和运动估计的挑战，尤其是在点云非固定采样或存在遮挡的情况下。

Method: 使用3D高斯模型表示物体，参数化时间相关的旋转、平移和缩放，建立点与高斯模型的对应关系。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态点云分析中表现优异，尤其在遮挡和点云动态采样场景下。

Abstract: Part segmentation and motion estimation are two fundamental problems for
articulated object motion analysis. In this paper, we present a method to solve
these two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single
articulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point
clouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.
Instead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the
object surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the
object undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using
measurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods
that rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an
alternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we
represent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D
Gaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,
translations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our
representation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences
between the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of
each point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned
Gaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our
method outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point
correspondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate
real-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further
demonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to
existing approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are
completely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation
performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with
occlusions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种确定性方法，用于高效估计6D姿态置信区域，解决了采样方法的速度和区域过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于采样的6D姿态置信区域估计方法存在速度慢和置信区域过大的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用归纳共形预测校准高斯关键点分布为2D关键点置信区域，并通过隐函数定理直接传播到6D姿态置信区域。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效且紧凑的6D姿态置信区域估计方案，优于现有采样方法。

Abstract: 6D pose confidence region estimation has emerged as a critical direction,
aiming to perform uncertainty quantification for assessing the reliability of
estimated poses. However, current sampling-based approach suffers from critical
limitations that severely impede their practical deployment: 1) the sampling
speed significantly decreases as the number of samples increases. 2) the
derived confidence regions are often excessively large. To address these
challenges, we propose a deterministic and efficient method for estimating pose
confidence regions. Our approach uses inductive conformal prediction to
calibrate the deterministically regressed Gaussian keypoint distributions into
2D keypoint confidence regions. We then leverage the implicit function theorem
to propagate these keypoint confidence regions directly into 6D pose confidence
regions. This method avoids the inefficiency and inflated region sizes
associated with sampling and ensembling. It provides compact confidence regions
that cover the ground-truth poses with a user-defined confidence level.
Experimental results on the LineMOD Occlusion and SPEED datasets show that our
method achieves higher pose estimation accuracy with reduced computational
time. For the same coverage rate, our method yields significantly smaller
confidence region volumes, reducing them by up to 99.9\% for rotations and
99.8\% for translations. The code will be available soon.

Result: XTransfer在多种人类感知任务中达到最先进性能，显著降低数据收集、模型训练和边缘部署成本。

Conclusion: XTransfer为边缘系统中的人类感知任务提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant
opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are
hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of
edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models
often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands,
resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor
adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose
XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic
model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained
models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model
repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with
only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and
recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to
create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human
sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results
demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human
sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection,
model training, and edge deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设源图像质量高且对齐，但实际中图像可能未对齐或质量差，导致融合效果下降。UniFuse旨在解决这一问题。

Method: UniFuse结合降解感知提示学习、Omni统一特征表示和自适应LoRA协同网络（ALSN），实现多方向信息融合和跨模态对齐与恢复的联合优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，UniFuse在多个数据集上优于现有方法，实现了对齐、恢复和融合的高效一体化。

Conclusion: UniFuse通过统一框架解决了医学图像融合中的对齐和恢复问题，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Current multimodal medical image fusion typically assumes that source images
are of high quality and perfectly aligned at the pixel level. Its effectiveness
heavily relies on these conditions and often deteriorates when handling
misaligned or degraded medical images. To address this, we propose UniFuse, a
general fusion framework. By embedding a degradation-aware prompt learning
module, UniFuse seamlessly integrates multi-directional information from input
images and correlates cross-modal alignment with restoration, enabling joint
optimization of both tasks within a unified framework. Additionally, we design
an Omni Unified Feature Representation scheme, which leverages Spatial Mamba to
encode multi-directional features and mitigate modality differences in feature
alignment. To enable simultaneous restoration and fusion within an All-in-One
configuration, we propose a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module,
incorporating the Adaptive LoRA Synergistic Network (ALSN) based on LoRA
principles. By leveraging ALSN's adaptive feature representation along with
degradation-type guidance, we enable joint restoration and fusion within a
single-stage framework. Compared to staged approaches, UniFuse unifies
alignment, restoration, and fusion within a single framework. Experimental
results across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and
significant advantages over existing approaches.

Conclusion: JGAU方法在彩色点云上采样中表现优异，显著提升了PSNR指标。

Abstract: Colored point cloud, which includes geometry and attribute components, is a
mainstream representation enabling realistic and immersive 3D applications. To
generate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep
learning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that
learns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial
attribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset
for colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121
large-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute
complexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve
the quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU
framework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a
geometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the
latter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood
correlations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute
up-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation
(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate
coarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement
module is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce
high-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and
geometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10
decibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,
8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, JGAU achieves average PSNR gains of 2.32 decibels, 2.47 decibels, 2.28
decibels, and 2.11 decibels at these four up-sampling rates, demonstrating
significant improvement.

Conclusion: 该方法通过预训练模型和可控推理过程，有效解决了金属透镜成像的挑战，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational
imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational
restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical
calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world
imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process
often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce
Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography,
leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of
large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths
to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and
suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \textit{pseudo} data
augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity
and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware
attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced
degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for
real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image
reconstruction. More materials: https://dmdiff.github.io/.

Conclusion: 结合隐式解码器的NCA框架可高效扩展到高分辨率任务，适用于多种NCA变体和任务。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical
cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly
applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including
self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and
spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and
morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This
limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow
quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information
which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands
of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this
limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by
recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on
a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary
resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and
texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with
minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture
and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and
performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD
outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent
properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,
inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,
and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and
morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed
framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal
computational overhead.

Abstract: The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen
significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse
environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world
demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing
simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the
challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges,
we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic
manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the
construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration
videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various
object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic
Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by
incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation
production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command
interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for
performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we
conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including
RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which
demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.

Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and

Conclusion: PixelBoost在图像超分辨率任务中实现了高逼真度和计算效率的平衡，尤其在纹理和边缘定义上表现突出。

Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a
trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This
issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps,
resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the
significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing
image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly
focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled
stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence
to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty
of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior
objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity
(LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR),
structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To
determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel
value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction
capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities
by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal
noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference
speeds.

Conclusion: 该方法在单帧LiDAR条件下实现了最先进的性能，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a
fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception.
A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and
structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings.
Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and
images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate
encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,
these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often
requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.
Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.
MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the
detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and
camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view
from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free
matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without
relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,
we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility
prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with
low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive
experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds),
despite using only single-frame LiDAR.

*Siyuan Chai,Xiaodong Guo,Tong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向任务的红外图像增强方法，通过层分解和显著性信息提取提升图像质量，适用于复杂天气条件下的自动驾驶感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像在复杂天气条件下（如雾、雨、低光）能提升自动驾驶感知能力，但低对比度问题（尤其是非热发射目标）影响下游视觉任务性能。

Method: 方法包括层分解（增强场景细节并保留暗区特征）和基于形态学重建的显著性提取（增强目标信息且不放大噪声）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在目标检测和语义分割任务中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了红外图像质量，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了更好的输入。

Abstract: Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous
driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light.
However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in
non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the
performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving
contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information
remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented
infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components:
layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an
layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details
while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent
saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological
reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and
enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the
image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: RGE-GS是一种新颖的扩展重建框架，结合扩散生成和奖励引导的高斯积分，解决了3D高斯溅射技术中的物理不一致性和训练效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单次驾驶片段常导致道路结构扫描不完整，需要扩展重建以支持传感器模拟器有效回归驾驶行为。

Method: RGE-GS通过奖励网络选择性地保留扩散输出以确保空间稳定性，并采用差异化训练策略优化高斯重建过程。

Result: 在公开数据集上的评估表明，RGE-GS在重建质量上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RGE-GS通过创新的奖励网络和训练策略，显著提升了重建质量和训练效率。

Abstract: A single-pass driving clip frequently results in incomplete scanning of the
road structure, making reconstructed scene expanding a critical requirement for
sensor simulators to effectively regress driving actions. Although contemporary
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction
quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors
often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive
reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with
reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key
innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and
prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases,
thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial
stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a
differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian
optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving
better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly
available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reconstruction quality. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RGE-GS. (Camera-ready version

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在图像地理位置推断方面表现出色，但引发隐私和伦理问题。研究分析了现有技术，发现模型在1公里半径内定位准确率达49%，并探讨了应对措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs的快速发展增强了推理能力，但也带来了隐私入侵风险，如通过图像推断地理位置。研究旨在评估其性能并探讨隐私影响。

Method: 系统综述现有MLLMs地理定位技术，评估其在街景图像定位任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 研究总结了成功定位的关键视觉元素（如文本、建筑风格），并讨论了技术及政策层面的应对措施以降低隐私风险。

Abstract: Objectives: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, enabling a wide range
of intelligent applications. However, these advancements also raise critical
concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the
geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or
captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing
serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other
security threats.
  Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation
techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and
evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on
geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view
imagery.
  Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large
models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to
$49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the
models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues
from visual data.
  Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual
elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text,
architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the
potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and
discuss several technical and policy-based coun-termeasures to mitigate
associated risks. Our code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: RoboScape为构建高效的物理感知世界模型提供了新思路，推动了具身智能研究的发展。

Abstract: World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence,
serving as powerful simulators capable of generating realistic robotic videos
while addressing critical data scarcity challenges. However, current embodied
world models exhibit limited physical awareness, particularly in modeling 3D
geometry and motion dynamics, resulting in unrealistic video generation for
contact-rich robotic scenarios. In this paper, we present RoboScape, a unified
physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and
physics knowledge within an integrated framework. We introduce two key
physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances
3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning
that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material
characteristics) while improving complex motion modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and
physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its
practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy
training with generated data and policy evaluation. Our work provides new
insights for building efficient physics-informed world models to advance
embodied intelligence research. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型复杂度增加导致解释性下降，现有方法缺乏有效干预或仅针对样本层面。

Method: 利用CBM作为可解释框架，通过全局梯度贡献识别和修正有害概念，并将修正后的知识蒸馏回黑盒模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上测试，最高准确率提升2.64%，平均准确率提升1.03%。

Conclusion: CBM-HNMU有效提升了模型的解释性和性能，为黑盒模型的理解和优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with
deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their
decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning,
most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without
modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck
Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU).
CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable
framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual
understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined
(removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM
then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both
interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and
transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft,
and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum
increase in average accuracy across 1.03%. Source code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaRA是一种基于小波变换的参数高效微调方法，通过多分辨率分析提升模型适应性，优于传统LoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）依赖全局低秩分解，忽略了局部或多尺度结构，无法捕捉权重更新中的复杂模式。

Method: WaRA利用小波变换将权重更新矩阵分解为多分辨率表示，在频域进行低秩分解并通过逆变换重建更新。

Result: WaRA在视觉任务（如图像生成、分类、语义分割）中表现优异，同时降低计算复杂度，且在语言任务中也有效。

Conclusion: WaRA通过多分辨率分析提供更灵活和稀疏的表示，适用于视觉和语言任务，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption across
various applications. Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its
extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model
adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However,
existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which
overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in
the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that
leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a
multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the
wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA
obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution
analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while
providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.
Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA
performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,
classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated
image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was
primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in
language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LiDAR世界模型在多领域的可迁移性，减少对标注数据的依赖，并解决现有模型的低效问题。

Method: 提出基于潜在条件流匹配（CFM）的框架，优化数据压缩和训练目标。

Result: 单预训练模型在多个领域迁移中表现优异，仅需5%标注数据即超越前人模型，计算效率显著提升。

Conclusion: LiDAR世界模型在多领域迁移中具有潜力，新框架显著提升效率和性能。

Abstract: LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware
representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR
world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for
which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong
transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain
transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor
generalization, (ii) sparse-beam \& dense-beam adaptation, and (iii)
non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data,
our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11%
absolute improvement (83\% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms
training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of
dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data
for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic
occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required
by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models,
mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training
objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching
(CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than
that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on
future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x
more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA
performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more
computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).

Result: 在名人、艺术风格和敏感内容擦除任务中表现优于现有方法，且对攻击提示具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CPE能有效擦除目标概念并保护剩余多样性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion models has brought a major
concern about potentially generating images on inappropriate or trademarked
concepts. Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting
target concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with
minimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods
usually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,
we first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion
models, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \emph{linear} modules to
weights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we
propose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding
\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or
cut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad
distributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the
forgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text
embeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance
robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of
celebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the
proposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while
deleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts. Code is

Motivation: 个性化在传统自动驾驶系统中已有研究，但在端到端自动驾驶（E2EAD）中被忽视，而用户对齐行为对信任和广泛采用至关重要。缺乏标注多样化驾驶偏好的大规模数据集是主要障碍。

Method: 提取静态环境特征和动态上下文线索，通过行为分布分析和规则启发式生成客观偏好标注，并利用视觉语言模型（VLM）生成主观标注，最终通过人机协作验证融合两者。

Result: 实验表明，结合个性化偏好的模型能生成更符合人类驾驶的行为，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为个性化E2EAD奠定了基础，提供了标准化平台，推动以人为中心的自动驾驶研究。

Abstract: While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving
systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving
(E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned
behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous
vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets
annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the
development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we
present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations
capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for
personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from
real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned
visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario
construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference
annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.
To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the
VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and
driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a
human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building
on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized
E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without
preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized
preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays
the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to
systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems,
catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.

Motivation: 脑电图（EEG）在情感脑机接口中具有高时间分辨率和捕捉真实情绪的优势，但跨被试泛化仍面临个体差异的挑战。

Method: FreqDGT结合频率自适应处理（FAP）、自适应动态图学习（ADGL）和多尺度时间解缠网络（MTDN），动态加权情感相关频段并学习特定输入的大脑连接模式。

Result: 实验表明FreqDGT显著提高了跨被试情绪识别的准确性。

Conclusion: FreqDGT通过频率、空间和时间建模的整合，有效解决了跨被试情绪识别的挑战。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a reliable and objective signal for
emotion recognition in affective brain-computer interfaces, offering unique
advantages through its high temporal resolution and ability to capture
authentic emotional states that cannot be consciously controlled. However,
cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual
variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a
frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses
these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces
frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant
frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic
graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and
implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines
hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to
capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves
cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of
integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical
modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences. The code is

TL;DR: MVOV3D提出了一种新方法，通过减少2D多视图融合中的固有噪声，提升开放词汇3D场景理解的性能，无需训练即可增强开放世界能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放词汇3D场景理解方法受限于有限的3D数据，难以处理多样化的对象类别。2D多视图融合方法虽然潜力大，但受视觉-语言模型固有噪声影响，性能不佳。

Method: MVOV3D利用CLIP编码器提取精确的区域级图像和文本特征，并结合3D几何先验优化多视图融合，减少噪声。

Result: MVOV3D在ScanNet200和Matterport160数据集上分别实现了14.7%和16.2%的mIoU，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MVOV3D通过优化多视图融合，显著提升了开放词汇3D场景理解的性能，展示了无需训练的潜力。

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on
training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by
distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these
methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies,
they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D
data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D
multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in
3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view
fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel
approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for
open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent
noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while
enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D
features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features
encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize
multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with
14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D
networks by a significant margin.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进测试时间提示调优（TPT）的方法，通过利用大语言模型（LLM）初始化提示并引入正则化损失，显著提升了视觉语言模型（VLM）的置信度校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TPT方法在提升准确率的同时忽视了置信度校准，导致在关键应用中受限。

Method: 1. 使用LLM初始化提示以减少过拟合；2. 提出正则化损失以减少类内距离并增加类间距离。

Result: 在15个数据集和不同CLIP架构上，方法显著降低了预期校准误差（ECE），平均ECE为4.11，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 通过改进提示初始化和引入正则化，TCA方法有效解决了TPT的置信度校准问题。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive performance in
image recognition by leveraging self-supervised training on large datasets.
Their performance can be further improved by adapting to the test sample using
test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Unfortunately, the singular focus of TPT
approaches on improving the accuracy suffers from tunnel vision, and leads to
degradation in confidence calibration. This limits the applicability of TPT in
critical applications.
  We make three contributions in this work. (1) We posit that random or naive
initialization of prompts leads to overfitting on a particular test sample, and
is the main reason for miscalibration of the VLM after TPT. To mitigate the
problem, we propose careful initialization of test time prompt using prior
knowledge about the target label attributes from a large language model (LLM);
(2) To further maintain the quality of prompts during \tpt, we propose a novel
regularization loss to reduce intraclass distance, and increase inter-class
distance between the learnt
  Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and 15
datasets, we show that our approach can effectively improve the calibration
after TPT. We report an average expected calibration error (ECE) of 4.11 with
our method, TCA, compared to 11.7 for vanilla TPT, 6.12 for C-TPT (ICLR'24),

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Listener-Augmented GRPO的奖励框架，通过独立视觉语言模型的置信度评分优化强化学习奖励信号，显著提升了模型泛化能力和推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励模型在泛化性和避免记忆化方面表现不佳，需要复杂标注流程。强化学习（如GRPO）虽能提升泛化性，但在推理准确性上存在缺陷。

Method: 引入Listener-Augmented GRPO框架，利用独立视觉语言模型（Listener）重新评估推理链，生成密集且校准的置信度评分，优化RL奖励信号。

Result: 在ImageReward基准测试中达到67.4%的准确率，OOD性能提升6%，并减少了推理矛盾。

Conclusion: Listener-based奖励提供了一种可扩展且数据高效的方法，用于对齐视觉语言模型与人类偏好。

Abstract: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences
is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models
with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and
supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation
pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure
mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning
trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model
("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a
listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the
reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score,
shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer
correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent
model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the
ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD)
performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6%
over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong
GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards
provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with
nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here:

TL;DR: SemFaceEdit是一种基于生成辐射流形的新方法，通过语义场实现面部图像的局部编辑，同时保持其他区域的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D感知GAN技术中局部编辑能力不足的问题，提高面部图像的几何和外观编辑精度。

Method: 结合几何模块和外观模块，生成语义辐射场和RGB辐射场，并通过对抗训练实现语义感知的几何和外观解耦。

Result: 实验表明，SemFaceEdit在语义场编辑和辐射场解耦方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SemFaceEdit为面部图像的局部编辑提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite multiple view consistency offered by 3D-aware GAN techniques, the
resulting images often lack the capacity for localized editing. In response,
generative radiance manifolds emerge as an efficient approach for constrained
point sampling within volumes, effectively reducing computational demands and
enabling the learning of fine details. This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a
novel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by
generating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent
codes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance
associated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In
contrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire
radiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial
semantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network
comprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic
radiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible
for predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial
settings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The
appearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent
codes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced
control. Our experiments highlight SemFaceEdit's superior performance in
semantic field-based editing, particularly in achieving improved radiance field
disentanglement.

Motivation: 现有方法使用区域特征预测固定属性，限制了性能和泛化能力，无法处理未见属性。

Method: 提出FOCUS方法，包括多粒度混合令牌（MGMT）、属性引导视觉特征提取（AVFE）和区域感知对比学习（RACL）。

Result: 在PA100K、PETA和RAPv1数据集上验证了方法的有效性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: FOCUS方法通过自适应提取细粒度属性特征，显著提升了行人属性识别的性能。

Abstract: Pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) is a fundamental perception task in
intelligent transportation and security. To tackle this fine-grained task, most
existing methods focus on extracting regional features to enrich attribute
information. However, a regional feature is typically used to predict a fixed
set of pre-defined attributes in these methods, which limits the performance
and practicality in two aspects: 1) Regional features may compromise
fine-grained patterns unique to certain attributes in favor of capturing common
characteristics shared across attributes. 2) Regional features cannot
generalize to predict unseen attributes in the test time. In this paper, we
propose the \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{O}ptimization with semanti\textbf{C}
g\textbf{U}ided under\textbf{S}tanding (FOCUS) approach for PAR, which
adaptively extracts fine-grained attribute-level features for each attribute
individually, regardless of whether the attributes are seen or not during
training. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) to
capture latent features at varying levels of visual granularity, thereby
enriching the diversity of the extracted information. Next, we introduce the
Attribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages
textual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute
features from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that
textual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate
a Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes
within the same region to share consistent attention maps. Extensive
experiments on PA100K, PETA, and RAPv1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and strong generalization ability of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TIR方法缺乏解释性，而RES在大规模图像集合中计算成本高，因此需要一种统一两者的高效且精确的方法。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段使用SAM 2和Alpha-CLIP离线生成对象掩码和区域级嵌入；第二阶段用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）重新排序和对象定位。

Result: 在COCO和D$^3$数据集上，方法在检索准确性和分割质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MaTIR任务和提出的框架有效结合了TIR和RES，实现了高效检索和精确分割。

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (TIR) aims to find relevant images based on a textual
query, but existing approaches are primarily based on whole-image captions and
lack interpretability. Meanwhile, referring expression segmentation (RES)
enables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but
is computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies
TIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object
segmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework,
comprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second
stage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model
(MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract
region-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable
online retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and
generate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate
our approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements
in both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.

Result: 在工业缺陷数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法，实现了高精度缺陷分割。

Conclusion: 该框架有效填补了弱监督学习与高精度缺陷分割之间的鸿沟，为资源受限的工业场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality
inspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly
enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional
semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect
detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic
segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class
activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of
existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient
detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP),
which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas
with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a
region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally,
pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance
iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively
bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect
segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial
scenarios.

Conclusion: DMD-Net在网格去噪中表现出色，具有高鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: We present Deep Mesh Denoising Network (DMD-Net), an end-to-end deep learning
framework, for solving the mesh denoising problem. DMD-Net consists of a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network in which aggregation is performed in both the
primal as well as the dual graph. This is realized in the form of an asymmetric
two-stream network, which contains a primal-dual fusion block that enables
communication between the primal-stream and the dual-stream. We develop a
Feature Guided Transformer (FGT) paradigm, which consists of a feature
extractor, a transformer, and a denoiser. The feature extractor estimates the
local features, that guide the transformer to compute a transformation, which
is applied to the noisy input mesh to obtain a useful intermediate
representation. This is further processed by the denoiser to obtain the
denoised mesh. Our network is trained on a large scale dataset of 3D objects.
We perform exhaustive ablation studies to demonstrate that each component in
our network is essential for obtaining the best performance. We show that our
method obtains competitive or better results when compared with the
state-of-the-art mesh denoising algorithms. We demonstrate that our method is
robust to various kinds of noise. We observe that even in the presence of
extremely high noise, our method achieves excellent performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导视频编辑方法存在时间不一致、运动扭曲和领域转换受限的问题，主要原因是时空像素相关性建模不足。

Method: 提出STR-Match，利用2D空间注意力和1D时间模块计算STR评分，指导潜在优化，无需3D注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明，STR-Match在视觉质量和时空一致性上优于现有方法，且能保持源视频的关键视觉属性。

Conclusion: STR-Match通过优化时空像素相关性，显著提升了视频编辑的时空一致性和视觉质量。

Abstract: Previous text-guided video editing methods often suffer from temporal
inconsistency, motion distortion, and-most notably-limited domain
transformation. We attribute these limitations to insufficient modeling of
spatiotemporal pixel relevance during the editing process. To address this, we
propose STR-Match, a training-free video editing algorithm that produces
visually appealing and spatiotemporally coherent videos through latent
optimization guided by our novel STR score. The score captures spatiotemporal
pixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and
1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the
overhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into
a latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates
temporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong
performance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key
visual attributes of the source. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
STR-Match consistently outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and
spatiotemporal consistency.

Conclusion: DeSa2VA通过解耦和融合策略有效提升了分割和接地任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing video segmenter and grounder approaches, exemplified by Sa2VA,
directly fuse features within segmentation models. This often results in an
undesirable entanglement of dynamic visual information and static semantics,
thereby degrading segmentation accuracy. To systematically mitigate this issue,
we propose DeSa2VA, a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme integrating text
pre-training and a linear decoupling module to address the information
processing limitations inherent in SAM-2. Specifically, first, we devise a
pre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into
point-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks. These masks are
refined through a hybrid loss function to strengthen the model's semantic
grounding capabilities. Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden
states that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and
visual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy
synergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision
from predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks,
including image segmentation, image question answering, video segmentation, and
video question answering. Our codes are available at

for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it
was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition
patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides
two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed
by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition
type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples,
presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author,
being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as
grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the
users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces'
metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images
are included for further analysis.

Method: 通过对比学习模型计算图像和文本的语义信息量，提出基于信息增益的度量方法，并验证其有效性。

Result: 实验结果显示信息增益分数低的图像通常为占位图标，且度量方法与CLIP或SigLIP模型强相关（R²为0.98-1.00）。

Conclusion: 该方法计算成本低，适用于公开模型，为量化语义信息提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has the capacity to model multimodal probability
distributions by embedding and aligning visual representations with semantics
from captions. This approach enables the estimation of relational semantic
similarity; however, it remains unclear whether it can also represent absolute
semantic informativeness. In this work, we introduce a semantic informativeness
metric for an image calculated from text samples via a contrastive learning
model; similarly, the informativeness of a text is calculated from image
samples. We propose a redefinition of the concept of Information Gain, a
concept previously explored in natural language processing, extending its
application to the domains of vision and language. Our metric quantifies how
conditioning on an image distorts the distribution of associated texts, and
vice versa for text conditioning on image distributions. In OpenCLIP's
empirical results, we observe that images with the lowest Information Gain
scores often correspond to placeholder icons such as "image not found."
Furthermore, we propose to measure a norm-based metric of the embedding to
estimate the Information Gain, following the theoretical results for Skip-Gram
with Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding. Information Gain can be measured
using either CLIP or SigLIP, and the results demonstrate a strong correlation
with a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.98 to 1.00. After obtaining
the mean and the covariance of the sample embedding, the computational cost of
this method is independent of the sample size, and it is compatible with
publicly available, open-weight models.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model
that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image
editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1
incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token
refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like
GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation
tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a
language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation
tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the
enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score
of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent
state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In
text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the
DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves
4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the

of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

Motivation: 协作感知中，代理需接收其他代理的信息，易受恶意代理攻击，因此需要一种防御机制来保障系统安全。

Result: 实验证明CP-Guard能有效检测和消除恶意代理，提升系统可靠性。

Conclusion: CP-Guard为协作感知提供了一种高效且自适应的防御解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has been shown to be a promising technique for
multi-agent autonomous driving and multi-agent robotic systems, where multiple
agents share their perception information to enhance the overall perception
performance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, an ego agent needs
to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to
attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a
unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which
is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately
detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key
idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego
agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a
probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a
subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior
probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative
consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)
segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its
collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In
addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to
dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the
reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code

Conclusion: MoCa通过双向注意力、大规模无标签数据和多样化训练目标，显著提升了多模态嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs),
have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key
limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for
embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled
paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training
objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage
framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional
multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual
Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously
denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional
context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive
Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple
image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method
addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through
continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via
joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for
enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa
consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks,
achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with
both model size and training data on MMEB.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学视觉问答中生成错误答案的问题，同时避免检索无关上下文对推理能力的负面影响。

Method: 提出MOTOR方法，利用基于文本和视觉信息的检索和重新排序，结合接地字幕和最优传输技术。

Result: 在MedVQA数据集上，MOTOR平均准确率提升6.45%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOTOR通过多模态上下文优化检索，显著提升了医学视觉问答的准确性和临床相关性。

Abstract: Medical visual question answering (MedVQA) plays a vital role in clinical
decision-making by providing contextually rich answers to image-based queries.
Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they
often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation
addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but
risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning
capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing
approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment.
However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is
particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel
multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions
and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the
query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information.
Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to
augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation
demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%. Code is

TL;DR: MEMFOF是一种内存高效的多帧光流估计方法，通过优化设计在保持高精度的同时显著降低GPU内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前光流估计方法在高分辨率输入下GPU内存消耗过大，限制了实际应用。

Method: 结合多帧估计、减少相关体积和高分辨率训练协议，优化RAFT类架构设计。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最优，内存消耗显著降低（运行时2.09GB，训练时28.5GB）。

Conclusion: MEMFOF在高分辨率光流估计中实现了精度与效率的平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the
cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution
(FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical
flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame
estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU
memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely
positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for
cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from
RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and
high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially
reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive
alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness
for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method
ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289,
leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the
best Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有IMU系统在磁干扰环境中易产生方向估计误差，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用“检测-校正”策略，通过多IMU联合分析检测磁干扰，并利用人体运动先验校正方向误差。

Result: 实验表明，MagShield显著提高了磁干扰下的动作捕捉准确性，且兼容多种稀疏惯性动作捕捉系统。

Conclusion: MagShield有效解决了磁干扰问题，提升了稀疏惯性动作捕捉系统的实用性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method called MagShield, designed to address the
issue of magnetic interference in sparse inertial motion capture (MoCap)
systems. Existing Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) systems are prone to
orientation estimation errors in magnetically disturbed environments, limiting
their practical application in real-world scenarios. To address this problem,
MagShield employs a "detect-then-correct" strategy, first detecting magnetic
disturbances through multi-IMU joint analysis, and then correcting orientation
errors using human motion priors. MagShield can be integrated with most
existing sparse inertial MoCap systems, improving their performance in
magnetically disturbed environments. Experimental results demonstrate that
MagShield significantly enhances the accuracy of motion capture under magnetic
interference and exhibits good compatibility across different sparse inertial
MoCap systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UrbanLLaVA的多模态大语言模型，旨在统一处理多种城市数据，并在多样化城市任务中表现优于通用MLLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前城市研究方法多局限于特定数据类型，缺乏统一框架。多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的成功为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 通过构建多样化的城市指令数据集，并设计多阶段训练框架，分离空间推理增强与领域知识学习。

Result: 实验表明，UrbanLLaVA在单模态和跨模态任务中均优于开源和专有MLLMs，并展现出跨城市的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: UrbanLLaVA为城市研究提供了一个高效的多模态处理框架，其代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the
understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data
types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them
comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model
designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong
performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In
$\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset
encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from
location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a
multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement
from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and
downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.
Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results
from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms
open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex
cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

TL;DR: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) 通过输入空间的提示参数微调预训练视觉Transformer，发现数据分布非高斯性并提出白化方法加速学习，提出Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT) 提升性能并减少参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VPT中因图像块嵌入与Transformer自注意力模块交互产生的非高斯分布数据对提示学习的挑战。

Method: 提出白化数据方法，通过双线性模型学习提示，并进一步提出低秩版本以减少参数和计算开销。

Result: BPT显著加速提示学习并提升准确性（如CUB数据集上提升>25点），同时减少参数和计算成本。

Conclusion: BPT方法在多个基准数据集上优于VPT，展示了高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique
that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of
parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover
``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch
embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's
self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key
and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,
respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for
learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,
de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before
learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch
embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt
to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly
accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on
the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the
bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact,
low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields
the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT).
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT
methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count
and computation overhead.

TL;DR: VolumetricSMPL是一种神经体积人体模型，通过动态混合学习权重矩阵显著提升计算效率，在多项任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表面网格模型在处理几何实体交互时效率低，现有体积神经隐式模型在复杂人体关节或计算成本上存在不足。

Method: 利用神经混合权重（NBW）生成紧凑高效的MLP解码器，动态混合少量学习权重矩阵。

Result: 比COAP快10倍，GPU内存使用降低6倍，精度更高，支持SDF接触建模。

Conclusion: VolumetricSMPL在多项任务中展现出广泛适用性和显著性能提升。

Abstract: Parametric human body models play a crucial role in computer graphics and
vision, enabling applications ranging from human motion analysis to
understanding human-environment interactions. Traditionally, these models use
surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with
other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as
meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has
explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are
either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high
computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we
introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural
Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of
learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,
significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving
expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model
COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,
and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact
modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging
tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,
(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)
scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections. Our
results highlight its broad applicability and significant performance and
efficiency gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态内容的真实性增强，虚假信息变得更加隐蔽，尤其是在双语字幕新闻中，局部图像编辑和跨语言不一致性共同扭曲了含义。

Method: BiMi结合了区域级定位、跨模态和跨语言一致性检测，并引入在线检索模块增强泛化能力。使用GRPO提升解释质量。

Result: BiMi在分类准确率上提升8.9，定位准确率提升15.9，解释BERTScore提升2.5，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: BiMi在多语言虚假信息检测中取得了最先进的性能，并发布了BiMiBench基准和工具。

Abstract: The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more
subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are
frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such
content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies
that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We
introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs
region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection,
and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support
generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements
model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench,
a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing
real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic
manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance
interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in
classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in
explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic,
multilingual misinformation detection. Code, models, and datasets will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在图像分类任务中表现优异，但模型预测的可解释性仍是一个挑战。现有方法要么过于局部化（如显著性图），要么过于简化全局方法，无法捕捉重要局部行为。

Method: SATs利用图像片段（如“眼睛”）和显著性图，量化这些片段对模型预测的影响，揭示模型依赖的概念和虚假相关性。

Result: SATs能够解释任何可生成显著性图的分类器，提供了一种分析图像分类器的实用工具。

Conclusion: SATs填补了全局和局部解释之间的空白，为图像分类器的分析和调试提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how
models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on
local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which
visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However,
reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is
infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local
behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a
method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights.
SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency
maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model
relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance
on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance
sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of
saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named
segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and
overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and
debugging image classifiers.

Abstract: Scene categorization (SC) in remotely acquired images is an important subject
with broad consequences in different fields, including catastrophe control,
ecological observation, architecture for cities, and more. Nevertheless, its
several apps, reaching a high degree of accuracy in SC from distant observation
data has demonstrated to be difficult. This is because traditional conventional
deep learning models require large databases with high variety and high levels

investigation file introduces an innovative technique referred to as the
Cuttlefish Optimized Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (CO- BRNN) for type
of scenes in remote sensing data. The investigation compares the execution of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的解释性研究不足，冗余激活干扰了模型的可信度和可视化效果，需要一种新方法来提升解释质量。

Method: 提出TAM方法，结合因果推断和高斯滤波，减少上下文冗余激活对后续令牌解释的干扰。

Result: TAM在多种场景（如目标定位、失败案例分析、视频可视化等）中显著优于现有方法，提供高质量的可视化结果。

Conclusion: TAM方法有效提升了MLLMs的解释性和可视化效果，为模型理解和应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various
fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less
explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective
visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that
produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,
where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier
context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the
explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies
often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant
correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address
this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the
interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel
rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method
Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions
between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens
of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single
prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods,
showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various
scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video
visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color,
shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The

Conclusion: AutoT2IS在文本到图像集生成中表现出色，具有重要的实际价值。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world
applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency
requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with
specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their
generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more
challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate
sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user
instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce
$\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,
providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we
propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user
instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective
evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and
generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free
framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'
in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both
image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive
experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all
existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current
generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the
ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming
its substantial practical value. Visit our project in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的普及，90%的在线内容可能由AI生成，引发对政治虚假信息的担忧。现有水印技术易被篡改或绕过，亟需更安全的解决方案。

Method: PECCAVI通过将水印嵌入非熔化点（NMPs）并结合多通道频域水印技术，同时采用噪声抛光防止逆向工程。

Result: PECCAVI能有效抵御视觉转述攻击，保持水印的持久性和图像的无失真。

Conclusion: PECCAVI为AI生成内容的水印保护提供了模型无关的解决方案，相关资源将开源。

Abstract: A report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency predicts that by 2026,
up to 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated, raising
concerns among policymakers, who cautioned that "Generative AI could act as a
force multiplier for political disinformation. The combined effect of
generative text, images, videos, and audio may surpass the influence of any
single modality." In response, California's Bill AB 3211 mandates the
watermarking of AI-generated images, videos, and audio. However, concerns
remain regarding the vulnerability of invisible watermarking techniques to
tampering and the potential for malicious actors to bypass them entirely.
Generative AI-powered de-watermarking attacks, especially the newly introduced
visual paraphrase attack, have shown an ability to fully remove watermarks,
resulting in a paraphrase of the original image. This paper introduces PECCAVI,
the first visual paraphrase attack-safe and distortion-free image watermarking
technique. In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving
its core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI
strategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel
frequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter
reverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded
watermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic. All
relevant resources and codes will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: SIEDD是一种新型架构，通过共享编码器和离散解码器显著加速INR视频编码，速度提升20-30倍，同时保持重建质量和压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决INR视频编码速度慢的问题，同时不牺牲重建质量或坐标级控制能力。

Method: SIEDD采用共享编码器捕获全局低频特征，并并行训练轻量级离散解码器，结合坐标空间采样加速。

Result: 在HD和4K基准测试中，编码速度提升20-30倍，重建质量和压缩比保持竞争力。

Conclusion: SIEDD显著提升了高保真神经视频压缩的实用性，为实际部署提供了高效路径。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video
compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is
crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate
INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level
control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD
(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that
fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first
rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to
efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then
frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders
for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space
sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding
speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while

### [206] [ActAlign: Zero-Shot Fine-Grained Video Classification via Language-Guided Sequence Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22967)
*Amir Aghdam,Vincent Tao Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActAlign框架通过序列对齐方法实现零样本细粒度视频分类，无需视频监督或微调，性能优于大型视频语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本细粒度视频分类任务中，现有对比视觉语言模型无法捕捉时间结构的问题。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成有序子动作序列，通过动态时间规整（DTW）在共享嵌入空间中对齐视频帧。

Result: 在ActionAtlas基准上达到30.5%准确率，优于人类表现（61.6%），且参数更少。

Conclusion: 结合结构化语言先验和经典对齐技术，可扩展地释放视觉语言模型在细粒度视频理解中的潜力。

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot fine-grained video classification, where no
video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen action classes.
While contrastive vision-language models such as SigLIP demonstrate strong
open-set recognition via mean-pooled image-text similarity, they fail to
capture the temporal structure critical for distinguishing fine-grained
activities. We introduce ActAlign, a zero-shot framework that formulates video
classification as sequence alignment. For each class, a large language model
generates an ordered sub-action sequence, which is aligned with video frames
using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any
video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on the
extremely challenging ActionAtlas benchmark, where human accuracy is only
61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using
approximately 8x less parameters. These results demonstrate that structured
language priors, combined with classical alignment techniques, offer a scalable
and general approach to unlocking the open-set recognition potential of
vision-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的时间变异图像修复任务（TAMP），并提出了InDiTE-Diff方法，通过交互式分布转移估计和扩散模型提升修复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参考引导的图像修复方法在时间变异图像修复中表现不佳，因为参考图像与目标图像内容差异大且可能受损。

Method: 提出InDiTE模块交互补充语义，并结合扩散模型（InDiTE-Diff）进行潜在交叉参考。

Result: 在TAMP-Street数据集上实验表明，该方法优于现有参考引导修复方法。

Conclusion: InDiTE-Diff有效解决了时间变异图像修复问题，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on a novel and practical task, i.e., Time-vAriant
iMage inPainting (TAMP). The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image
by leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both
images captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,
i.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image
inpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content
distinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such
an application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image
by referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the
reference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to
achieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address
such an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution
Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the
time-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of
damaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP
solution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven
Diffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and
conducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack
of benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,
based on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the
TAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting
settings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided
image inpainting methods for solving TAMP.

TL;DR: FewCLIP提出了一种概率原型校准框架，通过多模态原型学习改进广义少样本语义分割（GFSS）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型的方法在少样本情况下缺乏适应性，FewCLIP旨在通过概率原型校准提高对稀缺标注数据的适应性和泛化能力。

Method: FewCLIP结合视觉校准原型和分布正则化，优化多模态原型学习，使其更具判别性和不确定性感知。

Result: 在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上，FewCLIP显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FewCLIP通过概率原型校准有效提升了GFSS的性能，尤其在少样本和类增量场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to extend a
segmentation model to novel classes with only a few annotated examples while
maintaining performance on base classes. Recently, pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve
generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.
However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,
limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,
particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we
propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over
multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive
prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype
calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable
visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive
representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning
techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these
calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and
uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to
limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental
results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed
FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS
and class-incremental setting. The code is available at

TL;DR: VLSR框架通过视觉-语言模型CLIP嵌入图像和文本标签到共享语义空间，利用余弦相似度进行标签清洗和聚类，提升工业图像数据集质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业应用中，大规模数据集（如众包和网络爬取）常存在标签噪声和不一致问题，高质量标签获取成本高，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 嵌入图像和标签到共享语义空间，通过余弦相似度清洗标签，并基于密度聚类合并语义相似标签。

Result: 在Factorynet数据集上，VLSR成功识别问题标签并提升一致性，显著减少标签词汇量。

Conclusion: VLSR以最小人工干预提升数据集质量，适用于工业应用中的鲁棒模型训练。

Abstract: The success of machine learning models in industrial applications is heavily
dependent on the quality of the datasets used to train the models. However,
large-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and
web-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This
problem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining
high-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces
Vision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a
vision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in
multi-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and
their associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the
CLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by
computing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization
is performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,
and surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing
image-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.
Second, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,
followed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels
into unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels
from both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate
that the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves
label consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label
vocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality
for training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with
minimal human intervention.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但对对抗攻击高度脆弱，尤其是在多模态（视觉和文本）被操纵的场景下。

Method: 研究验证了CroPA的跨提示迁移性，并提出了三项改进：新颖的初始化策略、跨图像迁移性研究以及针对视觉编码器注意力机制的新损失函数。

Result: 改进方法显著提高了攻击成功率（ASR），并在多个VLMs（如Flamingo、BLIP-2、InstructBLIP和LLaVA）上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了研究VLMs对抗漏洞的重要性，并为生成可迁移对抗样本提供了更鲁棒的框架，对实际应用中的VLM安全性有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized computer vision,
enabling tasks such as image classification, captioning, and visual question
answering. However, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly in scenarios where both visual and textual modalities can be
manipulated. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study of
"An Image is Worth 1000 Lies: Adversarial Transferability Across Prompts on
Vision-Language Models" validating the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA) and
confirming its superior cross-prompt transferability compared to existing
baselines. Beyond replication we propose several key improvements: (1) A novel
initialization strategy that significantly improves Attack Success Rate (ASR).
(2) Investigate cross-image transferability by learning universal
perturbations. (3) A novel loss function targeting vision encoder attention
mechanisms to improve generalization. Our evaluation across prominent VLMs --
including Flamingo, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP as well as extended experiments on
LLaVA validates the original results and demonstrates that our improvements
consistently boost adversarial effectiveness. Our work reinforces the
importance of studying adversarial vulnerabilities in VLMs and provides a more
robust framework for generating transferable adversarial examples, with
significant implications for understanding the security of VLMs in real-world
applications.

several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset
of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI
screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop
environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial
cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by
specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model
adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies,
demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy
achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity
over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding
benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging
ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9%
on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B

Conclusion: MusiXQA和Phi-3-MusiX为未来MLLMs在乐谱理解领域的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable visual
reasoning abilities in natural images, text-rich documents, and graphic
designs. However, their ability to interpret music sheets remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MusiXQA, the first
comprehensive dataset for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in music sheet
understanding. MusiXQA features high-quality synthetic music sheets generated
via MusiXTeX, with structured annotations covering note pitch and duration,
chords, clefs, key/time signatures, and text, enabling diverse visual QA tasks.
Through extensive evaluations, we reveal significant limitations of current
state-of-the-art MLLMs in this domain. Beyond benchmarking, we developed
Phi-3-MusiX, an MLLM fine-tuned on our dataset, achieving significant
performance gains over GPT-based methods. The proposed dataset and model
establish a foundation for future advances in MLLMs for music sheet
understanding. Code, data, and model will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage,
preterm birth, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Compared to
traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane,
providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs
accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous
automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we
develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text)
guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation
to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based
framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from
redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to
reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for
coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for
overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US
dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA
diagnosis. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhoo0302/CUA-US.

Result: 在四个公共医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，AugPaint优于现有方法，显著提升分割性能。

Conclusion: AugPaint为医学图像分割提供了一种高效的数据增强解决方案，解决了标注数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Collecting pixel-level labels for medical datasets can be a laborious and
expensive process, and enhancing segmentation performance with a scarcity of
labeled data is a crucial challenge. This work introduces AugPaint, a data
augmentation framework that utilizes inpainting to generate image-label pairs
from limited labeled data. AugPaint leverages latent diffusion models, known
for their ability to generate high-quality in-domain images with low overhead,
and adapts the sampling process for the inpainting task without need for
retraining. Specifically, given a pair of image and label mask, we crop the
area labeled with the foreground and condition on it during reversed denoising
process for every noise level. Masked background area would gradually be filled
in, and all generated images are paired with the label mask. This approach
ensures the accuracy of match between synthetic images and label masks, setting
it apart from existing dataset generation methods. The generated images serve
as valuable supervision for training downstream segmentation models,
effectively addressing the challenge of limited annotations. We conducted
extensive evaluations of our data augmentation method on four public medical
image segmentation datasets, including CT, MRI, and skin imaging. Results
across all datasets demonstrate that AugPaint outperforms state-of-the-art
label-efficient methodologies, significantly improving segmentation
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测在安全敏感应用中至关重要，但易受物理可实现攻击（如对抗性补丁和纹理）的威胁。现有对抗训练方法主要针对分类模型，对目标检测器的防御研究较少。

Method: 提出PBCAT方法，结合小区域梯度引导对抗补丁和全局微小对抗扰动，统一防御多种物理可实现攻击。

Result: 实验表明，PBCAT显著提升鲁棒性，检测准确率在对抗纹理攻击下比现有方法提高29.7%。

Conclusion: PBCAT是一种有效的统一防御方法，可应对多种物理可实现攻击。

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive
applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors
can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches
and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats.
Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense
against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the
$l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically
realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early
attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT
against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this
work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with
a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite
Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the
combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible
global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs,
PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also
unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive
experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved
robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art
defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over
previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

Result: AutoOpti3DGS仅需一个超参数，与现有3DGS框架兼容，生成更稀疏的场景表示。

Conclusion: AutoOpti3DGS有效减少冗余高斯基元，适用于内存或存储受限的硬件。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful approach in novel view
synthesis, delivering rapid training and rendering but at the cost of an
ever-growing set of Gaussian primitives that strains memory and bandwidth. We
introduce AutoOpti3DGS, a training-time framework that automatically restrains
Gaussian proliferation without sacrificing visual fidelity. The key idea is to
feed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete
Wavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters
are learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss
gradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine
process delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to
capture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through
extensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate
hyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks,
and consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with
memory or storage-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide
understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on
extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture
slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain
expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided
synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces
high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation
benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides.
To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer
learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results
show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides
significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This
demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled
lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on

Motivation: 由于SVLMs参数容量有限且指令跟随能力弱，现有训练范式（如SFT和RLVR）对其要求过高，导致伪思维痕迹和优势崩溃问题。

Result: 实验表明DyME能有效平衡记忆与探索，显著提升SVLMs的性能。

Conclusion: DyME是提升SVLMs思维可靠性的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Empowering Small-scale Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) with reliable thinking
capabilities remains fundamentally challenging due to their limited parameter
capacity and weak instruction-following abilities. Existing training paradigms,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding
the capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to
SVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,
ultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A
natural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity
to reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted
two-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency
toward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of
the combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm
that Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via
RLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes
to the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that
DyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial
performance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and
effective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities
remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal
understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method
directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring
successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a
priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial
consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on
curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer
model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual
information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across
diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual
representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable
and efficient multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years,
yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness,
generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding
paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel
segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during
transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the
CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,
CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters
with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By
modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the
selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a
general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can
adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the
embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation
indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across
multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves
significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera
attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.

TL;DR: VAP-Diffusion框架利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的外部知识，通过视觉属性提示生成更真实和多样化的医学图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的生成需要丰富的属性信息，但详细描述往往难以获取。

Method: 设计基于Chain-of-Thoughts的提示从MLLMs中提取描述，并提出原型条件机制增强生成器鲁棒性。

Result: 在四种数据集上的实验验证了VAP-Diffusion的有效性。

Conclusion: VAP-Diffusion通过结合外部知识和创新机制，显著提升了医学图像生成的质量和多样性。

Abstract: As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying
factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to
produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin
lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis,
such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions
are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed
Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from
pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality
and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from
MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following
Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic,
colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during
training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions
are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover,
to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test
time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings
to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of
medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles from single-view images remains a
challenging task due to the intricate interwoven structure and complex
topologies of braids. Existing strand-based hair reconstruction methods
typically focus on loose hairstyles and often struggle to capture the
fine-grained geometry of braided hair. In this paper, we propose a novel
unsupervised pipeline for efficiently reconstructing 3D braided hair from
single-view RGB images. Leveraging a synthetic braid model inspired by braid
theory, our approach effectively captures the complex intertwined structures of
braids. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, providing superior accuracy, realism, and
efficiency in reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles, supporting expressive
hairstyle modeling in digital humans.

Motivation: 探索跨模型知识如何影响测试时适应（TTA）过程，发现不同模型间可以互补指导。

Method: 提出COCA框架，包含协同适应（整合互补知识）和自我适应（增强模型独特性）两种策略。

Result: COCA显著提升现有SOTA性能，例如ViT-Base在ImageNet-C上的准确率从51.7%提升至64.5%。

Conclusion: 跨模型协同学习在TTA中有效，COCA可作为即插即用模块提升多种模型性能。

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with
potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding
impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus
on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing
question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our
findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can
provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are
substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like
MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base
(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model
Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)
Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models
throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)
Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised
learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive
experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module,
significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including
ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example,
with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy
on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖于手工设计的区域划分或特征空间，容易受到虚假统计相关性的干扰，且在开放世界场景中难以应对新型攻击。

Conclusion: CDAL通过最大化因果效应，鼓励网络捕捉泛化到未见源模型的生成模式，具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Counterfactually Decoupled Attention Learning
(CDAL) method for open-world model attribution. Existing methods rely on
handcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be
confounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel
attacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the
causal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model
attribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific
artifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the
resulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned
attention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation
patterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect.
Extensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show
that with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves
state-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel
attacks. Source code: https://github.com/yzheng97/CDAL.

Conclusion: Mamba-FETrack V2框架在计算效率和性能上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust
object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However,
most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity
Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across
modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also
limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose
an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity
Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a
lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each
modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate
modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the
modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based
FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,
cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused
representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target
localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,
FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the
proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Mamba_FETrack

Result: DyCL在分层检索性能和跨视角地理定位准确性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DyCL为解决复杂空间关系问题提供了有效方案，并通过公开代码和基准数据集推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based cross-view geo-localization methods primarily
focus on improving the accuracy of cross-domain image matching, rather than
enabling models to comprehensively capture contextual information around the
target and minimize the cost of localization errors. To support systematic
research into this Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization (DACVGL) problem,
we construct Distance-Aware Campus (DA-Campus), the first benchmark that pairs
multi-view imagery with precise distance annotations across three spatial
resolutions. Based on DA-Campus, we formulate DACVGL as a hierarchical
retrieval problem across different domains. Our study further reveals that, due
to the inherent complexity of spatial relationships among buildings, this
problem can only be addressed via a contrastive learning paradigm, rather than
conventional metric learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Dynamic
Contrastive Learning (DyCL), a novel framework that progressively aligns
feature representations according to hierarchical spatial margins. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DyCL is highly complementary to existing
multi-scale metric learning methods and yields substantial improvements in both
hierarchical retrieval performance and overall cross-view geo-localization
accuracy. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at

Motivation: 超声图像分割因解剖变异、成像协议多样和标注数据有限而具有挑战性，需要一种通用且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 使用18个公共超声数据集，通过LoRA微调Grounding DINO，并结合SAM2实现分割，测试集包含未见分布数据。

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable object segmentation in ultrasound imaging remains
a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, diverse imaging
protocols, and limited annotated data. In this study, we propose a
prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with
SAM2 to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total
of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver,
prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were
divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for
testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse,
and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen
datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise
of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence
on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on
code.sonography.ai after acceptance.

Motivation: 当前成像技术和脊柱结构复杂性导致现有方法难以减少图像模糊影响和区分相似椎骨。

Conclusion: FMC-Net通过频率增强和多粒度上下文处理，显著提高了椎骨分割的准确性。

Abstract: Automated and accurate segmentation of individual vertebra in 3D CT and MRI
images is essential for various clinical applications. Due to the limitations
of current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing
methods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and
distinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a
Frequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the
accuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet
transform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred
images. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed
separately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency
Feature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter
out noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the
low-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)
to aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,
extracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies
with linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is
essential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on both CT and MRI vertebrae segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: 该研究为深入理解驾驶员注意力机制迈出关键一步，对自动驾驶、智能驾驶培训和人机交互有重要意义。

Abstract: Modeling task-driven attention in driving is a fundamental challenge for both
autonomous vehicles and cognitive science. Existing methods primarily predict
where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the
cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which
limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that
jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics
(what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To
support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver
attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and
causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal
conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further
propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention
prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive
reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets
and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper
understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for
autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer
interaction.

TL;DR: DC-TTA是一种新的测试时适应框架，通过用户交互监督改进SAM在复杂场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在专业领域或复杂场景（如伪装或多部分对象）中表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: DC-TTA将用户点击划分为更一致的子集，每个子集通过独立的TTA模型处理，减少冲突并实现局部更新。

Result: DC-TTA显著优于SAM的零样本结果和传统TTA方法，处理复杂任务（如伪装对象分割）时交互更少、准确率更高。

Conclusion: DC-TTA通过分而治之策略有效提升了SAM在复杂场景中的性能。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) allows users to iteratively refine object
boundaries with minimal cues, such as positive and negative clicks. While the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered attention in the IS community for its
promptable segmentation capabilities, it often struggles in specialized domains
or when handling complex scenarios (e.g., camouflaged or multi-part objects).
To overcome these challenges, we propose DC-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation
(TTA) framework that adapts SAM on a per-sample basis by leveraging user
interactions as supervision. Instead of forcing a single model to incorporate
all user clicks at once, DC-TTA partitions the clicks into more coherent
subsets, each processed independently via TTA with a separated model. This
Divide-and-Conquer strategy reduces conflicts among diverse cues and enables
more localized updates. Finally, we merge the adapted models to form a unified
predictor that integrates the specialized knowledge from each subset.
Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-TTA
significantly outperforms SAM's zero-shot results and conventional TTA methods,
effectively handling complex tasks such as camouflaged object segmentation with
fewer interactions and improved accuracy.

Result: IT-Blender在视觉和文本概念混合上大幅优于基线方法，且能无损编码参考图像。

Conclusion: IT-Blender展示了生成模型在增强人类创造力方面的新应用潜力。

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique
and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in
practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive
biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space.
In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can
automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related
to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without
loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these
gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend
the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy
generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes
the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept
with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment
results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in
blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of
image generative models to augment human creativity.

Result: 实验表明，即使移除多个笔画，许多字符仍可区分，为简化策略提供了可能性。

Conclusion: 研究为多笔画汉字的系统简化提供了潜在方法，未来可进一步探索正式简化策略。

Abstract: Multi-stroke characters in scripts such as Chinese and Japanese can be highly
complex, posing significant challenges for both native speakers and,
especially, non-native learners. If these characters can be simplified without
degrading their legibility, it could reduce learning barriers for non-native
speakers, facilitate simpler and legible font designs, and contribute to
efficient character-based communication systems. In this paper, we propose a
framework to systematically simplify multi-stroke characters by selectively
removing strokes while preserving their overall legibility. More specifically,
we use a highly accurate character recognition model to assess legibility and
remove those strokes that minimally impact it. Experimental results on 1,256
character classes with 5, 10, 15, and 20 strokes reveal several key findings,
including the observation that even after removing multiple strokes, many
characters remain distinguishable. These findings suggest the potential for
more formalized simplification strategies.

Conclusion: CVC-RF通过多级细化有效提升CPG任务性能，为临床实践提供有力工具。

Abstract: Accurate carotid plaque grading (CPG) is vital to assess the risk of
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the small size and high
intra-class variability of plaque, CPG is commonly evaluated using a
combination of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound views in clinical
practice. However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification
methods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the
importance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement
Framework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and
Category-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold.
First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based
method for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second,
we propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's
global modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and
diverse negative samples at the Corpus level. Third, we design a cascaded
down-sampling attention module to fuse multi-scale information and achieve
implicit feature interaction at the View level. Finally, a parameter-free
mixture-of-experts weighting strategy is introduced to leverage class
clustering knowledge to weight different experts, enabling feature decoupling
at the Category level. Experimental results indicate that CVC-RF effectively
models global features via multi-level refinement, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in the challenging CPG task.

Abstract: Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the
model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging
data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the
concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level
skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information
vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge
through pixel space optimization and existing core local information
identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset
distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level
refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency,
achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory
usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual
Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art,
demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple
dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with
ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the
method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and
50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and

Motivation: 现有方法在处理需要精确空间推理的复杂指令时存在挑战，尽管3D点云数据提供了详细的空间线索。

Method: R²S框架模拟人类认知过程，将空间推理分为两个阶段：先识别相关元素，再根据视觉先验处理指令。同时，提出了3D ReasonSeg数据集。

Result: 实验表明，R²S和3D ReasonSeg显著提升了3D点云感知的空间推理能力。

Conclusion: R²S和3D ReasonSeg为未来研究提供了新的基准和数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud perception have demonstrated remarkable
progress in scene understanding through vision-language alignment leveraging
large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods may still encounter
challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial
reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such
as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we
propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based
segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by
decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying
relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated
visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets
in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based
segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation
samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud
perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they
can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉基础模型DINOv2的艺术抄袭检测方法，通过检索视觉相似的真实艺术品来识别和解释抄袭行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护艺术家版权和知识产权，解决艺术抄袭检测这一法医分析中的难题。

Method: 构建合成数据集，使用DINOv2提取特征并检索相似图像，通过相似度阈值分类抄袭；进一步用度量学习微调模型以提高检索质量。

Result: 基线方法识别准确率达97.2%，但检索精度低（29.0% AP）；微调后检索性能提升12% AP，但识别准确率降至92.7%。

Conclusion: 讨论了结果并提出未来研究方向，强调需平衡识别准确率和检索性能。

Abstract: Art plagiarism detection plays a crucial role in protecting artists'
copyrights and intellectual property, yet it remains a challenging problem in
forensic analysis. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing
plagiarized paintings and explaining the detected plagarisms by retrieving
visually similar authentic artworks. To support this study, we construct a
dataset by collecting painting photos and synthesizing plagiarized versions
using generative AI, tailored to specific artists' styles. We first establish a
baseline approach using off-the-shelf features from the visual foundation model
DINOv2 to retrieve the most similar images in the database and classify
plagiarism based on a similarity threshold. Surprisingly, this non-learned
method achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97.2\% but suffers from low
retrieval precision 29.0\% average precision (AP). To improve retrieval
quality, we finetune DINOv2 with a metric learning loss using positive and
negative sample pairs sampled in the database. The finetuned model greatly
improves retrieval performance by 12\% AP over the baseline, though it
unexpectedly results in a lower recognition accuracy (92.7\%). We conclude with
insightful discussions and outline directions for future research.

TL;DR: VisualPrompter是一个无需训练的提示工程框架，通过自动反思模块和细粒度提示优化机制，提升生成图像与用户描述的语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提升图像风格和美学时忽视了语义对齐，导致生成图像内容不满意。

Method: 采用自动反思模块识别缺失概念，并通过细粒度提示优化机制优化用户输入。

Result: 在多个文本-图像对齐评估基准上达到最新最优性能，且具有即插即用设计。

Conclusion: VisualPrompter有效解决了语义对齐问题，适用于多种生成模型。

Abstract: Since there exists a notable gap between user-provided and model-preferred
prompts, generating high-quality and satisfactory images using diffusion models
often requires prompt engineering to optimize user inputs. Current studies on
text-to-image prompt engineering can effectively enhance the style and
aesthetics of generated images. However, they often neglect the semantic
alignment between generated images and user descriptions, resulting in visually
appealing but content-wise unsatisfying outputs. In this work, we propose
VisualPrompter, a novel training-free prompt engineering framework that refines
user inputs to model-preferred sentences. In particular, VisualPrompter
utilizes an automatic self-reflection module to identify the missing concepts
in generated images and a target-specific prompt optimization mechanism to
revise the prompts in a fine-grained manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our VisualPrompter, which achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks for text-image alignment evaluation.
Additionally, our framework features a plug-and-play design, making it highly
adaptable to various generative models.

TL;DR: AlignCVC通过分布对齐而非严格回归损失改进单图到3D生成中的跨视图一致性（CVC），显著提升生成质量和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过预训练生成模型合成的中间多视图图像缺乏跨视图一致性（CVC），导致3D重建性能下降。

Method: 提出AlignCVC框架，通过软硬对齐策略分别优化生成和重建模型，实现多视图分布与真实分布的对齐。

Result: 实验证明AlignCVC显著提升CVC和生成质量，推理速度加快至仅需4步。

Conclusion: AlignCVC作为一种即插即用方法，有效整合多视图生成与3D重建模型，为单图到3D生成提供新思路。

Abstract: Single-image-to-3D models typically follow a sequential generation and
reconstruction workflow. However, intermediate multi-view images synthesized by
pre-trained generation models often lack cross-view consistency (CVC),
significantly degrading 3D reconstruction performance. While recent methods
attempt to refine CVC by feeding reconstruction results back into the
multi-view generator, these approaches struggle with noisy and unstable
reconstruction outputs that limit effective CVC improvement. We introduce
AlignCVC, a novel framework that fundamentally re-frames single-image-to-3D
generation through distribution alignment rather than relying on strict
regression losses. Our key insight is to align both generated and reconstructed
multi-view distributions toward the ground-truth multi-view distribution,
establishing a principled foundation for improved CVC. Observing that generated
images exhibit weak CVC while reconstructed images display strong CVC due to
explicit rendering, we propose a soft-hard alignment strategy with distinct
objectives for generation and reconstruction models. This approach not only
enhances generation quality but also dramatically accelerates inference to as
few as 4 steps. As a plug-and-play paradigm, our method, namely AlignCVC,
seamlessly integrates various multi-view generation models with 3D
reconstruction models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of AlignCVC for single-image-to-3D generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分布深度正则化（DDR）的方法，解决了动态3D场景新视角合成中因相机运动范围有限导致的几何表示和相机参数估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D场景的新视角合成在相机运动范围有限时，现有方法难以准确表示场景几何和估计相机参数。

Method: 提出DDR方法，通过Gumbel-softmax采样点并计算误差期望，同时引入约束确保边界前的体积密度接近零。还结合相机参数学习提升鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在小相机运动输入下表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DDR方法有效解决了有限相机运动下的场景表示问题，提升了合成质量。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis for dynamic $3$D scenes poses a significant challenge.
Many notable efforts use NeRF-based approaches to address this task and yield
impressive results. However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion
parallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes
limited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods
encounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry
and inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior
methods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To
address the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth
Regularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align
with the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use
depth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the
expectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample
points from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce
constraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object
boundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the
correct geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a
visualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at
the rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera
parameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to
camera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion
input, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 随着视频内容在教育、职业和社交领域的增加，需要超越传统单模态方法的有效摘要技术。

Method: 通过提取韵律特征、文本线索和视觉指标，识别语义和情感重要时刻，并利用跨模态强调的“奖励词”提升摘要质量。

Result: 实验结果显示，在文本和视频评估指标上均显著优于传统方法，如ROUGE-1从0.4769提升至0.7929，F1-Score提高近23%。

Conclusion: 多模态整合在生成全面且行为感知的视频摘要方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The increasing volume of video content in educational, professional, and
social domains necessitates effective summarization techniques that go beyond
traditional unimodal approaches. This paper proposes a behaviour-aware
multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and
visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic
features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies
semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the
identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple
modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of
the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT)
summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such
as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics.
Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore
from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework
improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of
multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed
video summaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流自监督学习方法依赖单标签高体量数据集（如ImageNet），忽略了多标签图像的丰富语义信息，导致预训练开销大且应用受限。

Method: 提出块级增强模块以提取多标签图像中的潜在正视图对，并设计图像感知对比损失以建立视图间的联系。

Result: 在样本质量和数量受限的情况下，通过线性微调和迁移学习验证了方法的竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在多标签图像的自监督学习中表现出色，减少了预训练开销并提升了语义表示能力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in learning
representations through comparison methods that align with human intuition.
However, mainstream SSL methods heavily rely on high body datasets with single
label, such as ImageNet, resulting in intolerable pre-training overhead.
Besides, more general multi-label images are frequently overlooked in SSL,
despite their potential for richer semantic information and broader
applicability in downstream scenarios. Therefore, we tailor the mainstream SSL
approach to guarantee excellent representation learning capabilities using
fewer multi-label images. Firstly, we propose a block-wise augmentation module
aimed at extracting additional potential positive view pairs from multi-label
images. Subsequently, an image-aware contrastive loss is devised to establish
connections between these views, thereby facilitating the extraction of
semantically consistent representations. Comprehensive linear fine-tuning and
transfer learning validate the competitiveness of our approach despite
challenging sample quality and quantity.

Abstract: We introduce Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning

At the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory
system that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists
of a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a
spatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By
integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves
relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social
relationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent
beings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a
dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and
are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental
results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents
well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through
observation and social interaction. Our findings highlight the transformative
potential of combining structured memory systems with foundation models for
advancing embodied intelligence. More videos can be found at

Result: 实验验证了所提方法的优越性，能够提高背景与对象的时空区分能力，渲染时间连续的动态场景。

Conclusion: 时空解耦的高斯泼溅框架有效解决了高动态场景重建中的时空特征不匹配问题。

Abstract: High-dynamic scene reconstruction aims to represent static background with
rigid spatial features and dynamic objects with deformed continuous
spatiotemporal features. Typically, existing methods adopt unified
representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal
features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm
fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame
imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.
To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various
latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between
background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate
for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting
framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we
figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in
frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal
features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between
background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that
Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal
characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal
disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the
cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal
discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous
dynamic scene. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

Motivation: 尽管多模态模型在统一理解和生成方面取得了进展，但运动-语言统一模型的研究仍不足。需要解决运动模态与离散表示的重建差距以及统一训练中语言智能的退化问题。

Result: 实验表明，MotionGPT3在运动理解和生成任务中表现优异，同时保持了强大的语言能力。

Conclusion: MotionGPT3建立了一个在自回归框架内统一的运动扩散双模态模型。

Abstract: Though recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated strong
capabilities and opportunities in unified understanding and generation, the
development of unified motion-language models remains underexplored. To enable
such models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be
addressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion
modality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the
second is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training.
Inspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal
motion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling
motion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective
cross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve
language intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and
parameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is
integrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information
flow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this
continuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly
from intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete
tokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive
performance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving
strong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion
framework within an autoregressive manner.

Conclusion: Trident通过创新的训练方法和架构设计，显著提升了人脸伪造检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: As face forgeries generated by deep neural networks become increasingly
sophisticated, detecting face manipulations in digital media has posed a
significant challenge, underscoring the importance of maintaining digital media
integrity and combating visual disinformation. Current detection models,
predominantly based on supervised training with domain-specific data, often
falter against forgeries generated by unencountered techniques. In response to
this challenge, we introduce \textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection
framework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for
enhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \textit{Trident} is
trained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,
capturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from
manipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance
generalizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery
discriminator. This adversarial component guides our embedding model towards
forgery-agnostic representations, improving its robustness to unseen
manipulations. In addition, we prevent gradient flow from the classifier head
to the embedding model, avoiding overfitting induced by artifacts peculiar to
certain forgeries. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will
release our code in a GitHub repository.

Method: 提出HAMW方法，包括三阶段框架：通过高频增强输入优化特征提取，用多级Haar小波融合替代自注意力层以降低计算复杂度并提升多尺度特征捕捉能力。

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上，HAMW实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HAMW有效提升了Transformer在人员搜索任务中的性能，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The person search task aims to locate a target person within a set of scene
images. In recent years, transformer-based models in this field have made some
progress. However, they still face three primary challenges: 1) the
self-attention mechanism tends to suppress high-frequency components in the
features, which severely impacts model performance; 2) the computational cost
of transformers is relatively high. To address these issues, we propose a novel
High-frequency Augmentation and Multi-Wave mixing (HAMW) method for person
search. HAMW is designed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction
capabilities of transformers while reducing computational overhead and
improving efficiency. Specifically, we develop a three-stage framework that
progressively optimizes both detection and re-identification performance. Our
model enhances the perception of high-frequency features by learning from
augmented inputs containing additional high-frequency components. Furthermore,
we replace the self-attention layers in the transformer with a strategy based
on multi-level Haar wavelet fusion to capture multi-scale features. This not
only lowers the computational complexity but also alleviates the suppression of
high-frequency features and enhances the ability to exploit multi-scale
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAMW achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的3D形状补全方法未能显式建模最优全局传输路径，且受限于体素空间的分辨率约束，导致补全效果不佳。

Method: BridgeShape将形状补全建模为最优传输问题，并引入深度增强的VQ-VAE编码3D形状到紧凑潜在空间，利用多视角深度信息和DINOv2特征增强几何感知。

Result: BridgeShape在大规模3D形状补全基准测试中达到最先进性能，支持更高分辨率和未见过的物体类别。

Conclusion: BridgeShape通过潜在扩散和最优传输路径显式建模，实现了高效且高保真的3D形状补全。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based 3D shape completion methods typically use a
conditional paradigm, injecting incomplete shape information into the denoising
network via deep feature interactions (e.g., concatenation, cross-attention) to
guide sampling toward complete shapes, often represented by voxel-based
distance functions. However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the
optimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover,
performing diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints,
limiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these
challenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion
via latent diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two
aspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport
problem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete
shapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation. (ii) We introduce a
Depth-Enhanced Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode 3D
shapes into a compact latent space, leveraging self-projected multi-view depth
information enriched with strong DINOv2 features to enhance geometric
structural perception. By operating in a compact yet structurally informative
latent space, BridgeShape effectively mitigates resolution constraints and
enables more efficient and high-fidelity 3D shape completion. BridgeShape
achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale 3D shape completion
benchmarks, demonstrating superior fidelity at higher resolutions and for
unseen object classes.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled RGB-only SLAM

reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking
undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with

tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality
mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable
pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust
geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric
Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary
geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose
estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For
mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes
geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized
Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust
mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on
multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior
RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our
method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory
Error (ATE) by 69.0\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. The
implementation of our method will be released as open-source.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is critical in clinical
settings to prevent serious complications. While CT imaging remains the
standard diagnostic tool, the growing number of cases can overwhelm
radiologists, potentially causing delays. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning model that leverages 3D CT scans for appendicitis classification,
incorporating Slice Attention mechanisms guided by external 2D datasets to
enhance small lesion detection. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical
classification framework using pre-trained 2D models to differentiate between
simple and complicated appendicitis. Our approach improves AUC by 3% for
appendicitis and 5.9% for complicated appendicitis, offering a more efficient
and reliable diagnostic solution compared to previous work.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态和区域一致性策略有效提升了场景级标注下的点云语义分割性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates indoor point cloud semantic segmentation under
scene-level annotation, which is less explored compared to methods relying on
sparse point-level labels. In the absence of precise point-level labels,
current methods first generate point-level pseudo-labels, which are then used
to train segmentation models. However, generating accurate pseudo-labels for
each point solely based on scene-level annotations poses a considerable
challenge, substantially affecting segmentation performance. Consequently, to
enhance accuracy, this paper proposes a high-quality pseudo-label generation
framework by exploring contemporary multi-modal information and region-point
semantic consistency. Specifically, with a cross-modal feature guidance module,
our method utilizes 2D-3D correspondences to align point cloud features with
corresponding 2D image pixels, thereby assisting point cloud feature learning.
To further alleviate the challenge presented by the scene-level annotation, we
introduce a region-point semantic consistency module. It produces regional
semantics through a region-voting strategy derived from point-level semantics,
which are subsequently employed to guide the point-level semantic predictions.
Leveraging the aforementioned modules, our method can rectify inaccurate
point-level semantic predictions during training and obtain high-quality
pseudo-labels. Significant improvements over previous works on ScanNet v2 and
S3DIS datasets under scene-level annotation can demonstrate the effectiveness.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our
approach's individual components. The code is available at

Motivation: 无人机快速普及，但复杂条件下的小物体检测仍具挑战性，现有方法在多模态输入下性能下降。

Method: 提出DGE-YOLO，采用双分支架构处理红外和可见光图像，引入EMA机制增强多尺度特征学习，并使用Gather-and-Distribute模块减少信息损失。

Conclusion: DGE-YOLO在多模态无人机物体检测任务中表现优异。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has highlighted
the importance of robust and efficient object detection in diverse aerial
scenarios. Detecting small objects under complex conditions, however, remains a
significant challenge. Existing approaches often prioritize inference speed,
leading to degraded performance when handling multi-modal inputs. To address
this, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed
to effectively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a
dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the
model to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic
representation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism
that enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace
the conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute module to mitigate
information loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone
Vehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV
object detection tasks.

Motivation: 解决超级计算机上大规模模拟的通信延迟问题，现有方法依赖管理员才能获取的物理链路层信息。

Method: 1. 空间PCL事件定位方法；2. 构建通信依赖DAG分析传播路径；3. 设计CS-Glyph展示通信状态；4. 制定PCL事件归因策略。

Result: 在TH-1A超级计算机上验证了PCLVis的有效性，显著提高了模拟效率。

Conclusion: PCLVis为普通用户提供了高效的通信延迟分析工具，无需管理员权限即可优化模拟性能。

Abstract: Large-scale simulations on supercomputers have become important tools for
users. However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge
communication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication
latency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is
only available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is
proposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)
events. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI
process communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event
locating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are
classified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.
Second, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a
communication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help
users interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a
located PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is
designed to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called
the communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show
its communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each
leaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL
event attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their
simulations. The effectiveness of the PCLVis framework is demonstrated by
analyzing the PCL events of several simulations running on the TH-1A
supercomputer. By using the proposed framework, users can greatly improve the
efficiency of their simulations.

Conclusion: Causal-VidSyn通过结合因果实体和行为识别，为合成具有真实因果关系的交通事故视频提供了有效方法，并展示了其优越性能。

Abstract: Egocentricly comprehending the causes and effects of car accidents is crucial
for the safety of self-driving cars, and synthesizing causal-entity reflected
accident videos can facilitate the capability test to respond to unaffordable
accidents in reality. However, incorporating causal relations as seen in
real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues
that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their
related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a
novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic
accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion,
Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify
the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason
answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we
further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M
frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show
that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms
of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident
video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video
generation.

Abstract: We present \textbf{Met}a-\textbf{T}oken \textbf{Le}arning (Mettle), a simple
and memory-efficient method for adapting large-scale pretrained transformer
models to downstream audio-visual tasks. Instead of sequentially modifying the
output feature distribution of the transformer backbone, Mettle utilizes a
lightweight \textit{Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)} module to distill in
parallel the intact audio or visual features embedded by each transformer layer
into compact meta-tokens. This distillation process considers both pretrained
knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. The obtained meta-tokens
can be directly applied to classification tasks, such as audio-visual event
localization and audio-visual video parsing. To further support fine-grained
segmentation tasks, such as audio-visual segmentation, we introduce a
\textit{Meta-Token Injection (MTI)} module, which utilizes the audio and visual
meta-tokens distilled from the top transformer layer to guide feature
adaptation in earlier layers. Extensive experiments on multiple audiovisual
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory usage and
training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks
to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based
paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and
detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods
are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned
distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps
uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically,
we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score
matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function
by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and
assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input
sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate
unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score
matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting
intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the
corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original
data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an
enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all
three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator.
Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of our method.

Conclusion: MoMa在提升视频理解能力的同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Video understanding is a complex challenge that requires effective modeling
of spatial-temporal dynamics. With the success of image foundation models
(IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most
of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately,
which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper,
we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full
spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling
into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal
information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features.
By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances
video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa,
achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly advanced the field of computer
vision. To improve DNN training process, knowledge distillation methods
demonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating network training by introducing
a fixed learning direction from the teacher network to student networks. In
this context, several distillation-based optimization strategies are proposed,
e.g., deep mutual learning and self-distillation, as an attempt to achieve
generic training performance enhancement through the cooperative training of
multiple networks. However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to
the poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks
across different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive
distillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as
a teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance.
Competitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task
and engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to
improve the parameter updating process. We further introduce stochastic
perturbation in competitive distillation, aiming to motivate networks to induce
mutations to achieve better visual representations and global optimum. The
experimental results show that competitive distillation achieves promising
performance in diverse tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in AIGC have exacerbated the misuse of malicious deepfake
content, making the development of reliable deepfake detection methods an
essential means to address this challenge. Although existing deepfake detection
models demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods
only provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In
critical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the
credibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the
interpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation
masks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of
these methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most
current deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few
datasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted
forgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data
scale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios. To address this
predicament, we construct a novel large-scale deepfake detection and
localization ($\textbf{DDL}$) dataset containing over $\textbf{1.8M}$ forged
samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{75}$ distinct deepfake methods. The DDL
design incorporates four key innovations: (1) $\textbf{Diverse Forgery
Scenarios}$, (2) $\textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods}$, (3) $\textbf{Varied
Manipulation Modes}$, and (4) $\textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations}$.
Through these improvements, our DDL not only provides a more challenging
benchmark for complex real-world forgeries, but also offers crucial support for
building next-generation deepfake detection, localization, and interpretability
methods. The DDL dataset project page is on

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, with broad applications in e-commerce and digital fashion.
While recent advances in latent diffusion models have substantially improved
visual quality, existing approaches still struggle with preserving fine-grained
garment details, achieving precise garment-body alignment, maintaining
inference efficiency, and generalizing to diverse poses and clothing styles. To
address these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent
diffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a
progressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware
garment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained
deformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via
a cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment,
the original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality
rendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit
effectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and
visual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as
textures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the
human body. Extensive experiments on large-scale VTON benchmarks demonstrate
that DiffFit achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual evaluations.

Conclusion: Endo-4DGX在光照不均的内窥镜场景中表现出色，有望推动机器人辅助手术的发展。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of soft tissue is crucial for advancing automation in
image-guided robotic surgery. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic
surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in
scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure.
Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization
problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we
present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive
Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven
lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively
models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware
enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a
spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness
adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior
rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while
maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control
loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for
illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that
Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art
reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments,
underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications. Our

Motivation: 解决现有对比学习模型在像素级空间精度上的不足，以及扩散模型在迭代次数与分割质量之间的平衡问题。

Method: 提出FastSeg框架，包括双提示机制、分层注意力细化方法（HARD）和测试时翻转（TTF）方案。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC、PASCAL Context和COCO Object基准测试中达到43.8%的平均mIoU，表现最优。

Conclusion: FastSeg在分割质量和推理效率之间取得了平衡，为扩展性提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from
arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets.
Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they
often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation
bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial
features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local
details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of
iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose
FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of
reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg
performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the
segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a
dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction,
(ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused
cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time
Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive
experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free
performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context,
and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for
extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference
efficiency.

Motivation: 传统VLMs在描述性任务上表现优异，但其是否真正理解场景仍不确定。IR3D-Bench旨在通过主动创建而非被动识别来验证VLMs的理解能力。

Conclusion: IR3D-Bench为系统研究和开发工具使用的VLAs提供了数据与评估协议，推动通过创建实现真正的场景理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at descriptive tasks, but whether they
truly understand scenes from visual observations remains uncertain. We
introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding
through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the
analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs)
with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying
3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through
tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using
generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational
capacity measured by traditional scene understanding benchmarks. We provide a
comprehensive suite of metrics to evaluate geometric accuracy, spatial
relations, appearance attributes, and overall plausibility. Initial experiments
on agentic inverse rendering powered by various state-of-the-art VLMs highlight

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CycleVAR的新方法，通过Softmax Relaxed Quantization解决传统量化方法在图像翻译中的梯度中断问题，并在无监督图像翻译任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于向量量化的方法在无监督图像翻译中存在梯度中断问题，限制了端到端优化的效果。

Method: 提出Softmax Relaxed Quantization，将码本选择转化为连续概率混合过程；并设计CycleVAR，通过多尺度源图像令牌作为上下文提示，实现图像条件自回归生成。

Result: 并行单步生成模式在无监督场景下表现优于串行多步模式，且CycleVAR在质量和速度上均超越现有方法（如CycleGAN-Turbo）。

Conclusion: CycleVAR通过梯度保留和高效生成模式，显著提升了无监督图像翻译的性能。

Abstract: The current conditional autoregressive image generation methods have shown
promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the
practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without
explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the
discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based
frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder
decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during
adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using
Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook
selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby
preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation,
we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as
image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale
source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based
conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the
target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling
iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation
synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental
findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior
translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step
mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative
results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised
image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.

TL;DR: GeoProg3D是一个视觉编程框架，通过自然语言实现城市规模高保真3D场景的交互，结合地理感知和视觉API，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语言方法在小规模环境中表现良好，但缺乏处理大规模复杂城市场景的能力。

Method: 提出GeoProg3D框架，包含地理感知3D语言场（GCLF）和地理视觉API（GV-APIs），利用LLM动态组合工具。

Result: 在GeoEval3D基准测试中，GeoProg3D在多项任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoProg3D首次实现通过自然语言在城市规模3D环境中进行组合地理推理。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with
3D scenes via natural language. However, existing approaches are typically
limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional
reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome
these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that
enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D
scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware
City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient
hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic
information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues,
distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii)
Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as
area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language
models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate
GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess
performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging
tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement.
Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D
language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our
knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic
reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单主体场景，多主体训练数据构造困难，且缺乏利用深度、掩码等信号控制视频编辑的研究。

Method: 提出VideoCus-Factory数据构造管道生成多主体训练数据，结合IVTM训练和扩散Transformer框架（OmniVCus），引入Lottery Embedding和Temporally Aligned Embedding机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: OmniVCus通过高效数据构造和嵌入机制，实现了多主体视频定制和信号控制编辑的突破。

Abstract: Existing feedforward subject-driven video customization methods mainly study
single-subject scenarios due to the difficulty of constructing multi-subject
training data pairs. Another challenging problem that how to use the signals
such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject
in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose
a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs
for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control
signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our
constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with
image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the
customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus,
with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned
Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training
subjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation
process to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by
assigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens.
Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: Smartphone-based heart rate (HR) monitoring apps using finger-over-camera
photoplethysmography (PPG) face significant challenges in performance
evaluation and device compatibility due to device variability and
fragmentation. Manual testing is impractical, and standardized methods are
lacking. This paper presents a novel, high-throughput bench-testing platform to
address this critical need. We designed a system comprising a test rig capable
of holding 12 smartphones for parallel testing, a method for generating
synthetic PPG test videos with controllable HR and signal quality, and a host
machine for coordinating video playback and data logging. The system achieved a
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.11% +/- 0.001% between input and
measured HR, and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 +/- 0.008 between input and
measured PPG signals using a clinically-validated smartphone-based HR app.
Bench-testing results of 20 different smartphone models correctly classified
all the devices as meeting the ANSI/CTA accuracy standards for HR monitors
(MAPE <10%) when compared to a prospective clinical study with 80 participants,
demonstrating high positive predictive value. This platform offers a scalable
solution for pre-deployment testing of smartphone HR apps to improve app
performance, ensure device compatibility, and advance the field of mobile
health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像模型在生成复杂空间关系时的对齐问题，尤其是空间配置的准确性不足。

Method: 提出了PoS框架，包括PSE评估指标和PSG生成方法，后者通过梯度引导或搜索策略优化空间关系生成。

Result: PSE指标比传统方法更符合人类判断，PSG显著提升了模型在空间关系生成上的表现。

Conclusion: PoS框架有效提升了文本到图像模型的空间关系生成能力，为复杂场景生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate high-quality,
realistic, and diverse images, they face challenges in compositional
generation, often struggling to accurately represent details specified in the
input prompt. A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment
of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images
that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input
prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework
for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging
the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we
make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,
PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D
spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human
judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time
method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I
models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based
reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a
gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during
the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of
initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to
traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure
of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore,
PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate
images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的目标检测方法，将重点从基于类别的分类转向目标危害性判断，以提升自动驾驶车辆对未知物体的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测方法无法有效识别分布外（OOD）物体，可能导致自动驾驶车辆的安全隐患。

Method: 通过目标相对于车辆的位置和轨迹，将其分类为‘有害’或‘无害’。

Result: 模型能有效检测OOD物体并评估其危害性，提升自动驾驶决策效果。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了自动驾驶车辆在动态环境中的安全性和决策能力。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their
surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object
detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's
ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to
detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous
situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection
approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification
to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their
specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'
based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object
position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can
effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer
real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies
them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in
dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决病理图像数据稀缺问题，同时利用文本和掩码数据的优势，但现有公共数据集缺乏配对的文本和掩码数据。

Method: 提出PathDiff框架，将未配对的文本和掩码数据整合到统一的条件空间中，生成高质量图像。

Result: PathDiff在图像保真度、文本-图像对齐和忠实度方面表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PathDiff为下游任务（如核分割和分类）提供了有效的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in synthesizing
histopathology images to address data scarcity caused by privacy constraints.
Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks
offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct
morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data
for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image
generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits
of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial
details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that
effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities
into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over
structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically
accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment,
and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei
segmentation and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
superiority over existing methods.

Motivation: 传统CAM方法在WSSS中存在部分激活和边界模糊问题，而扩散模型生成的显著图易受背景噪声干扰。

Method: 结合扩散模型的梯度图和CAM，通过对比学习训练像素解码器，生成低维嵌入空间用于分割。

Result: 在两个公共医学数据集上的四个分割任务中，CLDF显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CLDF通过对比学习有效解决了扩散模型在WSSS中的噪声问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels
often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However,
traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise
object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and
segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as
an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong
image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By
modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related
objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps
generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse
diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with
Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to
train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a
low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate
gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify
foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for
contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental
results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上实验表明，AdFair-CLIP显著提高了公平性和诊断准确性，且在零样本和少样本场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: AdFair-CLIP为基于CLIP的医学诊断模型（尤其是胸部X光分析）设定了公平性学习的新基准。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated
superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image
classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have
received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical
issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities
in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To
address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing
adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby
mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that
AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while
maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These
results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based
medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

Motivation: Chamfer Distance（CD）仅依赖欧氏距离，无法捕捉3D形状的内在几何特性，因此需要一种更有效的度量方法。

Method: 提出GeoCD，一种拓扑感知且完全可分的测地距离近似方法，用于替代CD。通过微调使用GeoCD的模型进行验证。

Result: 实验表明，GeoCD在各种架构和数据集上均显著提升了重建质量，仅需单次微调即可在多指标上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: GeoCD是一种有效的替代CD的度量方法，能够更好地捕捉3D形状的几何特性。

Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) is a widely adopted metric in 3D point cloud learning
due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it suffers from a fundamental
limitation: it relies solely on Euclidean distances, which often fail to
capture the intrinsic geometry of 3D shapes. To address this limitation, we
propose GeoCD, a topology-aware and fully differentiable approximation of
geodesic distance designed to serve as a metric for 3D point cloud learning.
Our experiments show that GeoCD consistently improves reconstruction quality
over standard CD across various architectures and datasets. We demonstrate this
by fine-tuning several models, initially trained with standard CD, using GeoCD.
Remarkably, fine-tuning for a single epoch with GeoCD yields significant gains
across multiple evaluation metrics.

Result: 在DIV2K和Kodak数据集上，渲染性能与GaussianImage相当或更优，训练时间减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高质量渲染的同时，显著提升了训练效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has demonstrated remarkable advances in
the field of image representation but demands substantial GPU resources.
GaussianImage recently pioneered the use of Gaussian Splatting to mitigate this
cost, however, the slow training process limits its practicality, and the fixed
number of Gaussians per image limits its adaptability to varying information
entropy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a generalizable and
self-adaptive image representation framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting.
Our method employs a network to quickly generate a coarse Gaussian
representation, followed by minimal fine-tuning steps, achieving comparable
rendering quality of GaussianImage while significantly reducing training time.
Moreover, our approach dynamically adjusts the number of Gaussian points based
on image complexity to further enhance flexibility and efficiency in practice.
Experiments on DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our method matches or exceeds
GaussianImage's rendering performance with far fewer iterations and shorter
training times. Specifically, our method reduces the training time by up to one
order of magnitude while achieving superior rendering performance with the same
number of Gaussians.

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled image inpainting models to
generate content within specific regions of an image based on provided prompts
and masks. However, existing inpainting methods often suffer from problems such
as semantic misalignment, structural distortion, and style inconsistency. In
this work, we present MTADiffusion, a Mask-Text Alignment diffusion model
designed for object inpainting. To enhance the semantic capabilities of the
inpainting model, we introduce MTAPipeline, an automatic solution for
annotating masks with detailed descriptions. Based on the MTAPipeline, we
construct a new MTADataset comprising 5 million images and 25 million mask-text
pairs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task training strategy that integrates
both inpainting and edge prediction tasks to improve structural stability. To
promote style consistency, we present a novel inpainting style-consistency loss
using a pre-trained VGG network and the Gram matrix. Comprehensive evaluations
on BrushBench and EditBench demonstrate that MTADiffusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.

Conclusion: 该方法成功提升了CLIP模型在动作感知任务中的表现，为细粒度视觉-语言对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as
CLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved
remarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level
visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained
details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects.
Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual
representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level
alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to
perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships
between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained
action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware
multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external
knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an
action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional
semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in
LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate
attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for
establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which
further improves the performance. Comprehensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is crucial for autonomous navigation,
environmental monitoring, and marine exploration, but it is severely hampered
by light attenuation, turbidity, and occlusion. Current methods balance
accuracy and computational efficiency, but they have trouble deploying in
real-time under low visibility conditions. Through the integration of
physics-informed augmentation techniques with the YOLOv12 architecture, this
study advances underwater detection. With Residual ELAN blocks to preserve
structural features in turbid waters and Area Attention to maintain large
receptive fields for occluded objects while reducing computational complexity.
Underwater optical properties are addressed by domain-specific augmentations
such as turbulence adaptive blurring, biologically grounded occlusion
simulation, and spectral HSV transformations for color distortion. Extensive
tests on four difficult datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
Brackish data registering 98.30% mAP at 142 FPS. YOLOv12 improves occlusion
robustness by 18.9%, small-object recall by 22.4%, and detection precision by
up to 7.94% compared to previous models. The crucial role of augmentation
strategy is validated by ablation studies. This work offers a precise and
effective solution for conservation and underwater robotics applications.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成动态性强且空间一致的全景视频，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了全景视频生成的模态差距问题，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Panoramic video generation aims to synthesize 360-degree immersive videos,
holding significant importance in the fields of VR, world models, and spatial
intelligence. Existing works fail to synthesize high-quality panoramic videos
due to the inherent modality gap between panoramic data and perspective data,
which constitutes the majority of the training data for modern diffusion
models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained
perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we
design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses
global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With
our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from
pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations
of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性，能有效提升扩散模型在多视图生成中的表现。

Abstract: Generating high-quality novel views of a scene from a single image requires
maintaining structural coherence across different views, referred to as view
consistency. While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view
synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views.
Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but
such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This
paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes
diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance
diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention
manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to
ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable
for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency
across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.

Conclusion: 通过注视信息的引入和弱监督下的时空建模，显著提升了视频显著目标检测的性能。

Abstract: The eye-tracking video saliency prediction (VSP) task and video salient
object detection (VSOD) task both focus on the most attractive objects in video
and show the result in the form of predictive heatmaps and pixel-level saliency
masks, respectively. In practical applications, eye tracker annotations are
more readily obtainable and align closely with the authentic visual patterns of
human eyes. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce fixation information to
assist the detection of video salient objects under weak supervision. On the
one hand, we ponder how to better explore and utilize the information provided
by fixation, and then propose a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module to
provide location and semantic guidance during the feature learning process. On
the other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak
supervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A
Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality
constraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate
object query for spatiotemporal modeling. In addition, an Intra-Inter Mixed
Contrastive (IIMC) model improves the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities
under weak supervision by forming an intra-video and inter-video contrastive
learning paradigm. Experimental results on five popular VSOD benchmarks
indicate that our model outperforms other competitors on various evaluation
metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且实用，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的性能。

Abstract: Traditional vision-based autonomous driving systems often face difficulties
in navigating complex environments when relying solely on single-image inputs.
To overcome this limitation, incorporating temporal data such as past image
frames or steering sequences, has proven effective in enhancing robustness and
adaptability in challenging scenarios. While previous high-performance methods
exist, they often rely on resource-intensive fusion networks, making them
impractical for training and unsuitable for federated learning. To address
these challenges, we propose lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, a
method that processes sequential image frames and temporal steering data by
breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices. This approach reduces
model complexity, enabling efficient weight updates for convergence and
real-time predictions while leveraging temporal information to enhance
autonomous driving performance. Intensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches by a clear margin
while achieving real-time performance. Additionally, real robot experiments
further confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Result: 在多种自监督模型（如DINO、MoCo、iBOT）上验证，即使没有源预训练，也能取得竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了自监督模型的测试时适应能力，为动态环境下的模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training on test-time data enables deep learning models to adapt to dynamic
environmental changes, enhancing their practical applicability. Online
adaptation from source to target domains is promising but it remains highly
reliant on the performance of source pretrained model. In this paper, we
investigate whether test-time adaptation (TTA) methods can continuously improve
models trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) without relying on source
pretraining. We introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol after observing that
existing TTA approaches struggle when directly applied to self-supervised
models with low accuracy on the source domain. Furthermore, we propose a
collaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging
contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation
refinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including
DINO, MoCo, and iBOT, across TTA benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in SSL, showing that it achieves competitive
performance even without source pretraining.

Motivation: 传统ViT依赖像素或补丁网格输入，GVIT旨在探索更紧凑的高斯表示，同时保持分类性能。

Method: 图像编码为数百个可学习2D高斯，参数（位置、尺度、方向等）与ViT分类器联合优化，利用分类器梯度指导高斯聚焦于类别显著区域。

Result: GVIT在Imagenet-1k上达到76.9% top-1准确率，性能接近传统ViT。

Conclusion: GVIT展示了高斯表示在ViT中的潜力，为输入表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce GVIT, a classification framework that abandons conventional
pixel or patch grid input representations in favor of a compact set of
learnable 2D Gaussians. Each image is encoded as a few hundred Gaussians whose
positions, scales, orientations, colors, and opacities are optimized jointly
with a ViT classifier trained on top of these representations. We reuse the
classifier gradients as constructive guidance, steering the Gaussians toward
class-salient regions while a differentiable renderer optimizes an image
reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that by 2D Gaussian input representations
coupled with our GVIT guidance, using a relatively standard ViT architecture,
closely matches the performance of a traditional patch-based ViT, reaching a
76.9% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet-1k using a ViT-B architecture.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于运动不变图融合的ToF深度去噪网络，通过跨帧几何注意力增强时间稳定性和空间清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ToF传感器捕获的深度图像易受噪声影响，现有方法未能同时处理时间不一致性和空间模糊性。

Method: 利用图结构的时域自相似性进行图融合，结合图像平滑先验和ToF噪声分布，构建最大后验问题，并通过迭代滤波器实现。

Result: 在合成DVToF数据集上达到最优性能，并在真实Kinectv2数据集上表现出鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在ToF深度去噪中实现了高精度和一致性，且具有可解释性。

Abstract: Depth images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are prone to noise,
requiring denoising for reliable downstream applications. Previous works either
focus on single-frame processing, or perform multi-frame processing without
considering depth variations at corresponding pixels across frames, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistency and spatial ambiguity. In this paper, we
propose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph
fusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness.
Specifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit
temporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph
fusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and
data fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum
a posterior problem for ToF denoising. Finally, the solution is unrolled into
iterative filters whose weights are adaptively learned from the graph-informed
geometric attention, producing a high-performance yet interpretable network.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on synthetic
DVToF dataset and exhibits robust generalization on the real Kinectv2 dataset.

TL;DR: PPFlow通过动态调整patch大小优化DiTs计算成本，高噪声时用大patch，低噪声时用小patch，提升推理速度且保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DiTs对所有时间步使用固定patch大小，PPFlow旨在通过动态调整patch大小优化计算效率。

Method: PPFlow采用金字塔式patch化流程，为不同噪声水平学习线性投影，并调整Unpatchify。

Result: PPFlow在推理速度上比SiT-B/2快1.6倍（2级）或2.0倍（3级），训练FLOPs略低且生成质量相近。

Conclusion: PPFlow显著提升DiTs效率，尤其适用于从预训练模型微调，代码已开源。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) adopt Patchify, mapping patch representations
to token representations through linear projections, to adjust the number of
tokens input to DiT blocks and thus the computation cost. Instead of a single
patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow
(PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and
small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for
each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow,
our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid
representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the
renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two
training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$)
inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with
slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance.
Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with
small training time. The code and checkpoint are at

Motivation: 解决多风格图像增强任务，通过简单但高效的两步模型实现广泛适用性。

Method: 使用Y-Net和C-Net分别预测eigenTF和CCM参数，通过K个可学习令牌支持多种风格。

Result: 在30个数据集上验证了Oneta在六种图像增强任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: Oneta是一种高效且通用的多风格图像增强方法。

Abstract: The first algorithm, called Oneta, for a novel task of multi-style image
enhancement is proposed in this work. Oneta uses two point operators
sequentially: intensity enhancement with a transformation function (TF) and
color correction with a color correction matrix (CCM). This two-step
enhancement model, though simple, achieves a high performance upper bound.
Also, we introduce eigentransformation function (eigenTF) to represent TF
compactly. The Oneta network comprises Y-Net and C-Net to predict eigenTF and
CCM parameters, respectively. To support $K$ styles, Oneta employs $K$
learnable tokens. During training, each style token is learned using image
pairs from the corresponding dataset. In testing, Oneta selects one of the $K$
style tokens to enhance an image accordingly. Extensive experiments show that
the single Oneta network can effectively undertake six enhancement tasks --
retouching, image signal processing, low-light image enhancement, dehazing,
underwater image enhancement, and white balancing -- across 30 datasets.

Abstract: The intrinsic link between facial motion and speech is often overlooked in

typically addressed as separate tasks. This paper introduces JAM-Flow, a
unified framework to simultaneously synthesize and condition on both facial

and incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned
positional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable
effective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths.
Trained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of
conditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference
motion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from
text, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model.

Motivation: 现有基于余弦相似度和softmax分类的人脸识别方法在处理硬样本时表现不佳，且未考虑人脸质量或识别难度，导致训练策略过于单一。

Method: 结合von Mises-Fisher分布的相似性度量，提出自适应边距的多分类方法，并利用代理损失函数优化表示空间分布，同时通过渲染器优化人脸重建。

Result: 在IJB-B数据集上达到49.39%的准确率，比第二名方法高出2.37%。

Conclusion: LH2Face通过自适应边距和概率密度函数显著提升了硬样本的识别性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR)
algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite
its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard
samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular
or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition
hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an
overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss
function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face).
Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution
is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density
Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability
distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification
method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is
implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to
apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their
representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that
optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is
superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving
49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method
by 2.37%.

Motivation: 现有方法通过深度估计或3D位置编码隐式地将2D特征转换为3D空间，限制了检测性能。受辐射场在3D重建中的成功启发，作者尝试将其用于增强3D几何估计能力。

Method: 提出物体中心辐射场（OcRF），专注于前景物体建模，避免背景噪声干扰；进一步利用渲染的副产品不透明度，通过高度感知的不透明度注意力（HOA）增强2D BEV特征。

Result: 在nuScenes验证和测试数据集上，OcRFDet以57.2% mAP和64.8% NDS的性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OcRFDet通过专注于前景物体建模和利用不透明度增强特征，显著提升了多视图3D目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D object detection methods typically transfer 2D features
into 3D space using depth estimation or 3D position encoder, but in a fully
data-driven and implicit manner, which limits the detection performance.
Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they
can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation.
However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use
them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the
performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when
rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric
radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding
background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields
(OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering
foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to
enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention
(HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately
via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP
and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark. Code will be available at

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，通过FID和LPIPS等感知质量指标验证。

Conclusion: MWT-Diff能有效解决卫星图像超分辨率问题，保留关键空间特征，适用于详细遥感分析。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-resolution satellite imagery is often constrained by
the spatial and temporal limitations of satellite sensors, as well as the high
costs associated with frequent observations. These challenges hinder
applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and
agricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data.
In this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image
super-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet
transforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel
metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates
embeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information,
and temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the
hierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively
reconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This
process preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns,
boundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for
detailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across
multiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent
approaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID
and LPIPS.

Abstract: Small object detection (SOD) in anti-UAV task is a challenging problem due to
the small size of UAVs and complex backgrounds. Traditional frame-based cameras
struggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame
rates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with
microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more
effective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection
datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse
backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we
introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV),
the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes
147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring
extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse
scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore,
based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in
spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation
Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud
space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion
continuity to guide the network in retaining target events. Extensive
experiments on the EV-UAV dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method and
provide a benchmark for future research in EVSOD. The dataset and code are at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP模型中文本与图像特征对齐的挑战，避免传统方法因特定类别提示导致的过拟合和泛化能力受限问题。

Method: 采用多类别名称堆叠生成堆叠提示，结合CSP模块构建通用提示和EFA模块训练知识特定线性层。

Result: 在七个工业异常检测数据集上实现零样本异常检测和分割任务的领先性能。

Conclusion: StackCLIP模型通过堆叠提示和模块化设计显著提升训练速度、稳定性和性能，具有广泛泛化能力。

Abstract: Enhancing the alignment between text and image features in the CLIP model is
a critical challenge in zero-shot industrial anomaly detection tasks. Recent
studies predominantly utilize specific category prompts during pretraining,
which can cause overfitting to the training categories and limit model
generalization. To address this, we propose a method that transforms category
names through multicategory name stacking to create stacked prompts, forming
the basis of our StackCLIP model. Our approach introduces two key components.
The Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) module constructs generic prompts
by stacking semantically analogous categories, while utilizing multi-object
textual feature fusion to amplify discriminative anomalies among similar
objects. The Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) module trains knowledge-specific
linear layers tailored for each stack cluster and adaptively integrates them
based on the attributes of test categories. These modules work together to
deliver superior training speed, stability, and convergence, significantly
boosting anomaly segmentation performance. Additionally, our stacked prompt
framework offers robust generalization across classification tasks. To further
improve performance, we introduce the Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) module,
which leverages the generalization power of stacked prompts to refine prompt
learning, elevating results in anomaly detection classification tasks.
Extensive testing on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets demonstrates
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot anomaly
detection and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) condenses large datasets into compact yet
informative substitutes, preserving performance comparable to the original
dataset while reducing storage, transmission costs, and computational
consumption. However, previous DD methods mainly focus on distilling
information from images, often overlooking the semantic information inherent in
the data. The disregard for context hinders the model's generalization ability,
particularly in tasks involving complex datasets, which may result in illogical
outputs or the omission of critical objects. In this study, we integrate
vision-language methods into DD by introducing text prototypes to distill
language information and collaboratively synthesize data with image prototypes,
thereby enhancing dataset distillation performance. Notably, the text
prototypes utilized in this study are derived from descriptive text information
generated by an open-source large language model. This framework demonstrates
broad applicability across datasets without pre-existing text descriptions,
expanding the potential of dataset distillation beyond traditional image-based
approaches. Compared to other methods, the proposed approach generates
logically coherent images containing target objects, achieving state-of-the-art
validation performance and demonstrating robust generalization. Source code and
generated data are available in

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、即插即用的方法（CAI），通过利用LVLMs对caption queries的注意力模式，有效减少视觉信息偏差（对象幻觉）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在解释视觉信息时经常产生与视觉信息不符的内容（对象幻觉），现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注或增加推理时间。

Method: 利用LVLMs对caption queries的注意力模式，提出Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention（CAI）方法，增强视觉感知能力。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CAI以最小的额外推理成本实现了最先进的幻觉缓解性能。

Conclusion: CAI是一种高效且无需训练的幻觉缓解方法，显著提升了LVLMs的视觉感知能力。

Abstract: Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce
content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination.
To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and
training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we
observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger
when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by
this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a
training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the
attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs'
visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four
benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that
CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only
with minimal additional inference cost.

Conclusion: SG-LDM及其翻译框架为激光雷达点云合成和跨域适应提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了生成质量和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Lidar point cloud synthesis based on generative models offers a promising
solution to augment deep learning pipelines, particularly when real-world data
is scarce or lacks diversity. By enabling flexible object manipulation, this
synthesis approach can significantly enrich training datasets and enhance
discriminative models. However, existing methods focus on unconditional lidar
point cloud generation, overlooking their potential for real-world
applications. In this paper, we propose SG-LDM, a Semantic-Guided Lidar
Diffusion Model that employs latent alignment to enable robust
semantic-to-lidar synthesis. By directly operating in the native lidar space
and leveraging explicit semantic conditioning, SG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generating high-fidelity lidar point clouds guided by semantic
labels. Moreover, we propose the first diffusion-based lidar translation
framework based on SG-LDM, which enables cross-domain translation as a domain
adaptation strategy to enhance downstream perception performance. Systematic
experiments demonstrate that SG-LDM significantly outperforms existing lidar
diffusion models and the proposed lidar translation framework further improves
data augmentation performance in the downstream lidar segmentation task.

TL;DR: PGOV3D提出了一种新的两阶段训练框架，通过从部分场景到全局场景的课程学习，提升开放词汇3D语义分割的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将多视角图像作为传递开放词汇信息的中介，忽略了其丰富的语义内容和跨视角对应关系，限制了模型效果。

Method: PGOV3D采用两阶段训练策略：1) 在部分场景上预训练，利用多模态大语言模型和2D分割基础模型生成开放词汇标签；2) 在完整场景上微调，通过伪标签桥接部分观察与大规模3D环境的语义差距。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和S3DIS基准测试中，PGOV3D表现出色。

Conclusion: PGOV3D通过部分到全局的课程学习和两阶段训练，显著提升了开放词汇3D语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation methods typically supervise
3D segmentation models by merging text-aligned features (e.g., CLIP) extracted
from multi-view images onto 3D points. However, such approaches treat
multi-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary
information, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view
correspondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose
PGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for
improving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in
a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on
partial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple
geometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs
via pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we
leverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation
foundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,
offering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency
module is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints
and enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model
on complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more
complex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and
generate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the
semantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D
environments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS
benchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in
open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttentionGS提出了一种新框架，通过结构注意力直接从随机初始化进行3D重建，解决了3DGS对高质量初始点云的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS依赖SfM生成的高质量点云，在纹理不足或视角受限的场景中表现不佳，限制了其应用范围。

Method: AttentionGS结合几何注意力和纹理注意力，早期恢复全局结构，后期优化细节；使用不透明度加权梯度指导高斯密集化。

Result: 实验表明，AttentionGS在点云初始化不可靠的场景中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为3DGS在现实应用中的鲁棒性和灵活性提供了新途径。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF), excelling in complex scene reconstruction and efficient
rendering. However, it relies on high-quality point clouds from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), limiting its applicability. SfM also fails in
texture-deficient or constrained-view scenarios, causing severe degradation in
3DGS reconstruction. To address this limitation, we propose AttentionGS, a
novel framework that eliminates the dependency on high-quality initial point
clouds by leveraging structural attention for direct 3D reconstruction from
randomly initialization. In the early training stage, we introduce geometric
attention to rapidly recover the global scene structure. As training
progresses, we incorporate texture attention to refine fine-grained details and
enhance rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ opacity-weighted gradients to
guide Gaussian densification, leading to improved surface reconstruction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AttentionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in
scenarios where point cloud initialization is unreliable. Our approach paves
the way for more robust and flexible 3D Gaussian Splatting in real-world
applications.

TL;DR: TurboVSR是一种基于扩散模型的超高效视频超分辨率方法，通过高压缩比自动编码器、分解条件和预训练模型转换，显著提升了计算效率，同时保持与现有方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法在细节生成方面表现优异，但计算效率低下，难以实用化。

Method: 1. 使用高压缩比自动编码器减少token数量；2. 引入分解条件降低训练复杂度；3. 将预训练扩散模型转换为捷径模型以减少采样步骤。

Result: TurboVSR在性能上与现有方法相当，但速度快100倍以上，处理2秒1080p视频仅需7秒，并支持4K图像超分辨率。

Conclusion: TurboVSR通过高效设计解决了扩散模型的计算效率问题，为高分辨率视频和图像超分辨率提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional promise in
the video super-resolution (VSR) task, achieving a substantial advancement in
detail generation relative to prior methods. However, these approaches face
significant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current
techniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p
video. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based
video super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1)
We employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\times$32$\times$8
to reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial
challenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the
learning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame;
subsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the
high-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We
convert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer
sampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs
on par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking
only 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports
image resolution by considering image as a one-frame video. Our efficient
design makes SR beyond 1080p possible, results on 4K (3648$\times$2048) image
SR show surprising fine details.

Result: 在AVSBench数据集的三个子集上实现了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: VCT框架有效提升了音频-视觉分割的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to segment sound-producing objects in
video frames based on the associated audio signal. Prevailing AVS methods
typically adopt an audio-centric Transformer architecture, where object queries
are derived from audio features. However, audio-centric Transformers suffer
from two limitations: perception ambiguity caused by the mixed nature of audio,
and weakened dense prediction ability due to visual detail loss. To address
these limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework
that leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio
and visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between
different sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their
contours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation
(PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that
are both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting
and pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VCT framework achieves new
state-of-the-art performances on three subsets of the AVSBench dataset. The
code is available at https://github.com/spyflying/VCT_AVS.

Abstract: Brain plays a crucial role in regulating body functions and cognitive
processes, with brain tumors posing significant risks to human health. Precise
and prompt detection is a key factor in proper treatment and better patient
outcomes. Traditional methods for detecting brain tumors, that include
biopsies, MRI, and CT scans often face challenges due to their high costs and
the need for specialized medical expertise. Recent developments in machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has exhibited strong capabilities in
automating the identification and categorization of brain tumors from medical
images, especially MRI scans. However, these classical ML models have
limitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets,
and long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our
research uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The
novelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model
which use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient
decision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate
results. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有显著的组合潜力，但对输入细节敏感，需根据场景选择合适方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have dramatically advanced text-to-image generation in
recent years, translating abstract concepts into high-fidelity images with
remarkable ease. In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct
concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new
visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending
merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts)
into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We
investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the
diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or
layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse
concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound
words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we
show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities
without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving
100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios:
each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like
prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome.
These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion
models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.

Abstract: Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral
regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR
diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these
approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to
suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an
automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color
Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature
mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical
realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis
as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships
between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification
mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR
grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a
feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the
representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated
our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases
with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised
video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg
demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at:

Abstract: In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely
on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions,
despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While
these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their
effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as
unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we
introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness
of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model
(LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to
specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range
of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across
six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness,
highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is
released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware
robustness assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Partial Forward Blocking (PFB)的新框架，通过自适应剪枝机制减少计算成本，同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据剪枝方法因依赖梯度或代理模型而带来的额外计算成本问题。

Method: PFB利用浅层特征评估样本重要性，剪枝不重要样本，仅保留重要样本进行后续计算，并结合概率密度动态调整样本优先级。

Result: 在ImageNet上，PFB在剪枝40%数据的情况下，实现了0.5%的准确率提升和33%的训练时间减少。

Conclusion: PFB是一种高效且无损的训练加速框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The ever-growing size of training datasets enhances the generalization
capability of modern machine learning models but also incurs exorbitant
computational costs. Existing data pruning approaches aim to accelerate
training by removing those less important samples. However, they often rely on
gradients or proxy models, leading to prohibitive additional costs of gradient
back-propagation and proxy model training. In this paper, we propose Partial
Forward Blocking (PFB), a novel framework for lossless training acceleration.
The efficiency of PFB stems from its unique adaptive pruning pipeline: sample
importance is assessed based on features extracted from the shallow layers of
the target model. Less important samples are then pruned, allowing only the
retained ones to proceed with the subsequent forward pass and loss
back-propagation. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational
overhead of deep-layer forward passes and back-propagation for pruned samples,
while also eliminating the need for auxiliary backward computations and proxy
model training. Moreover, PFB introduces probability density as an indicator of
sample importance. Combined with an adaptive distribution estimation module,
our method dynamically prioritizes relatively rare samples, aligning with the
constantly evolving training state. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant superiority of PFB in performance and speed. On ImageNet, PFB
achieves a 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction with 40%
data pruned.

Motivation: 解决传统剪枝方法在未见数据域上权重评估不准确的问题，以及任务敏感层在早期剪枝决策中表现不佳的问题。

Method: 提出P3B方法，利用块级相对贡献全局分配参数资源，识别低影响组件并保留关键部分，通过层间保持比确保后期收敛块的激活。

Result: P3B在高稀疏性（70%参数减少）下仅损失0.64%准确率，在迁移学习任务中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: P3B是一种先进的剪枝方法，适用于资源受限硬件，能在高稀疏性下保持高性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformer have set new benchmarks in several tasks, but these models
come with the lack of high computational costs which makes them impractical for
resource limited hardware. Network pruning reduces the computational complexity
by removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However,
pruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight
significance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we
find that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature
representation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early
pruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block
Benefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on
block level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact
components to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones.
Classical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements.
In contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance
metrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in
extensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most
noticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve
high performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction
while only losing 0.64% in accuracy.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了扩散模型在生成对抗样本时的泛化和迁移性问题，适用于更广泛的任务。

Abstract: Due to their powerful image generation capabilities, diffusion-based
adversarial example generation methods through image editing are rapidly
gaining popularity. However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability
of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to
generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake
detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example
transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates
traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based
adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application
across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the
"1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of
AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness
of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖语义对齐或视觉调整，难以同时处理视频数据的复杂时空模式和语义准确性。

Method: 引入双嵌入语义理解机制分离主体和运动表示，结合运动适配器和交替优化训练策略。

Result: 在T2V和I2V设置下，SynMotion优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SynMotion通过联合优化语义和视觉表示，实现了高质量的运动定制视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of
human motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving
arbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing
approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn
new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or
''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve
complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the
model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the
visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended
action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new
motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic
guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the
dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and
motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features
while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the
visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a
pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal
coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy
which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported
by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This
strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across
diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark
with diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V
settings demonstrate that \method outperforms existing baselines. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单张测试图像的体积分割方法，通过不确定性引导的自训练实现特征和预测一致性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床环境中实时推理需求与目标域数据不足的矛盾，同时充分利用医学影像的体积信息。

Method: 提出Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training方法，通过不确定性引导的自训练实现单图像测试时适应。

Result: 在三个公开乳腺MRI数据集上验证，性能接近监督基准，平均Dice系数提升3.75%。

Conclusion: 方法高效且易于集成，适用于临床实时推理，显著提升医学影像分割性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables a trained model to adjust to a new domain during
inference, making it particularly valuable in clinical settings where such
on-the-fly adaptation is required. However, existing techniques depend on large
target domain datasets, which are often impractical and unavailable in medical
scenarios that demand per-patient, real-time inference. Moreover, current
methods commonly focus on two-dimensional images, failing to leverage the
volumetric richness of medical imaging data. Bridging this gap, we propose a
Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training method for Single Image Test-Time
adaptation. Our method enforces feature and prediction consistency through
uncertainty-guided self-training, enabling effective volumetric segmentation in
the target domain with only a single test-time image. Validated on three
publicly available breast magnetic resonance imaging datasets for tumor
segmentation, our method achieves performance close to the upper bound
supervised benchmark while also outperforming all existing state-of-the-art
methods, on average by a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 3.75%. We publicly
share our accessible codebase, readily integrable with the popular nnUNet
framework, at https://github.com/smriti-joshi/muvi.git.

TL;DR: 提出Subjective Camera方法，通过结合语言描述和渐进草图，将主观感知转化为逼真图像，解决了语言模糊性和草图抽象性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在用户主观输入偏差、平面草图与3D先验的模态差异以及草图质量敏感性问题，需资源密集型调整或高精度草图要求。

Method: 采用概念顺序生成框架，通过文本奖励优化建立外观先验，顺序感知解耦生成处理草图顺序，潜在优化桥接模态差异，分层奖励引导支持粗糙草图。

Result: 在多样化数据集上验证，方法在语义和空间一致性上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Subjective Camera框架有效解决了现有挑战，无需训练调整即可适应主观预期，支持粗糙草图输入。

Abstract: We propose Subjective Camera, a human-as-imaging-device paradigm that
reconstructs real-world scenes from mental impressions through synergistic use
of verbal descriptions and progressive rough sketches. This approach overcomes
dual limitations of language ambiguity and sketch abstraction by treating the
user's drawing sequence as priors, effectively translating subjective
perceptual expectations into photorealistic images.
  Existing approaches face three fundamental barriers: (1) user-specific
subjective input biases, (2) huge modality gap between planar sketch and 3D
priors in diffusion, and (3) sketch quality-sensitive performance degradation.
Current solutions either demand resource-intensive model adaptation or impose
impractical requirements on sketch precision.
  Our framework addresses these challenges through concept-sequential
generation. (1) We establish robust appearance priors through text-reward
optimization, and then implement sequence-aware disentangled generation that
processes concepts in sketching order; these steps accommodate user-specific
subjective expectation in a train-free way. (2) We employ latent optimization
that effectively bridges the modality gap between planar sketches and 3D priors
in diffusion. (3) Our hierarchical reward-guided framework enables the use of
rough sketches without demanding artistic expertise. Comprehensive evaluation
across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in maintaining both semantic and spatial
coherence.

Motivation: 视频身份定制任务面临身份一致性和运动自然性的挑战，需要一种新方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Proteus-ID框架，包括多模态身份融合（MIF）、时间感知身份注入（TAII）和自适应运动学习（AML）模块。

Result: 实验表明Proteus-ID在身份保留、文本对齐和运动质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Proteus-ID为视频身份定制设立了新基准，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally
coherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a
text prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity
consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2)
generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address
these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework
for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we
propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and
textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing
coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance.
Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that
dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving
fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a
self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on
optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without
requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench,
a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150
individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity
preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark
for video identity customization. Codes and data are publicly available at

Method: 设计了两个自动化流程，使用稳定扩散技术生成高多样性语义的合成数据，并评估多种检测器。

Result: 合成数据能有效挑战检测器，发现其对物体位置的依赖强于语义。

Conclusion: 合成数据为挑战和改进开放词汇检测器提供了系统方法。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detectors such as Grounding DINO are trained on vast
and diverse data, achieving remarkable performance on challenging datasets. Due
to that, it is unclear where to find their limitations, which is of major
concern when using in safety-critical applications. Real-world data does not
provide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model
generalization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to
systematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In
this work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge
open-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find
systematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design
two automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with
high diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and
ChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple
open-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector. The
synthetic data is derived from two real-world datasets, namely LostAndFound, a
challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmark, and the NuImages
dataset. Our results indicate that inpainting can challenge open-vocabulary
object detectors in terms of overlooking objects. Additionally, we find a
strong dependence of open-vocabulary models on object location, rather than on
object semantics. This provides a systematic approach to challenge
open-vocabulary models and gives valuable insights on how data could be
acquired to effectively improve these models.

Result: 在开放集数据集和少样本基准测试（PASCAL VOC和MSCOCO）上取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: VisTex-OVLM在保持OVLM原有架构和泛化能力的同时，显著提升了少样本场景下的检测性能。

Abstract: We propose VisTex-OVLM, a novel image prompted object detection method that
introduces visual textualization -- a process that projects a few visual
exemplars into the text feature space to enhance Object-level Vision-Language
Models' (OVLMs) capability in detecting rare categories that are difficult to
describe textually and nearly absent from their pre-training data, while
preserving their pre-trained object-text alignment. Specifically, VisTex-OVLM
leverages multi-scale textualizing blocks and a multi-stage fusion strategy to
integrate visual information from visual exemplars, generating textualized
visual tokens that effectively guide OVLMs alongside text prompts. Unlike
previous methods, our method maintains the original architecture of OVLM,
maintaining its generalization capabilities while enhancing performance in
few-shot settings. VisTex-OVLM demonstrates superior performance across
open-set datasets which have minimal overlap with OVLM's pre-training data and
achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.
The code will be released at https://github.com/WitGotFlg/VisTex-OVLM.

Motivation: 现有RefSR方法在真实世界复杂场景（如跨传感器分辨率差异和显著地物变化）中表现不佳，导致生成不足或过度依赖参考图像。

Method: 基于预训练的Stable Diffusion模型，引入双分支融合机制自适应整合参考图像的局部和全局信息，并提出Better Start策略加速推理。

Result: 在Real-RefRSSRD数据集上，CRefDiff在多项指标上达到最优，并提升了场景分类和语义分割等下游任务性能。

Conclusion: CRefDiff通过可控参考和高效推理，显著提升了真实世界遥感图像超分辨率的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote
sensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct
high-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth
observation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods
have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior
performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR
observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world
complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover
changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image.
To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable
reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To
address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained
Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce
accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference,
we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both
local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel
dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference,
enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named
Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps,
thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we
introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing
images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land
cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on
Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and
semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于投影不变性的方法无法利用相机校准信息，导致重建结果仅能确定到投影变换，且需要更多数据。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入成对相对旋转估计，结合相机校准信息，将旋转平均集成到pOSE框架中，实现无需初始化的校准SfM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能可靠优化目标，从随机初始解高概率收敛到全局最优，实现准确的近度量重建。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用相机校准信息，显著提升了重建的准确性和效率，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: A recent series of works has shown that initialization-free BA can be
achieved using pseudo Object Space Error (pOSE) as a surrogate objective. The
initial reconstruction-step optimizes an objective where all terms are
projectively invariant and it cannot incorporate knowledge of the camera
calibration. As a result, the solution is only determined up to a projective
transformation of the scene and the process requires more data for successful
reconstruction.
  In contrast, we present a method that is able to use the known camera
calibration thereby producing near metric solutions, that is, reconstructions
that are accurate up to a similarity transformation. To achieve this we
introduce pairwise relative rotation estimates that carry information about
camera calibration. These are only invariant to similarity transformations,
thus encouraging solutions that preserve metric features of the real scene. Our
method can be seen as integrating rotation averaging into the pOSE framework
striving towards initialization-free calibrated SfM.
  Our experimental evaluation shows that we are able to reliably optimize our
objective, achieving convergence to the global minimum with high probability
from random starting solutions, resulting in accurate near metric
reconstructions.

Abstract: An innovative few-shot anomaly detection approach is presented, leveraging
the pre-trained CLIP model for medical data, and adapting it for both
image-level anomaly classification (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation
(AS). A dual-branch design is proposed to separately capture normal and
abnormal features through learnable adapters in the CLIP vision encoder. To
improve semantic alignment, learnable text prompts are employed to link visual
features. Furthermore, SigLIP loss is applied to effectively handle the
many-to-one relationship between images and unpaired text prompts, showcasing
its adaptation in the medical field for the first time. Our approach is
validated on multiple modalities, demonstrating superior performance over
existing methods for AC and AS, in both same-dataset and cross-dataset
evaluations. Unlike prior work, it does not rely on synthetic data or memory
banks, and an ablation study confirms the contribution of each component. The

Conclusion: LaZSL为可解释零样本学习提供了一种有效方法，兼具性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved
remarkable success in zero-shot learning (ZSL) by leveraging large-scale
visual-text pair datasets. However, these methods often lack interpretability,
as they compute the similarity between an entire query image and the embedded
category words, making it difficult to explain their predictions. One approach
to address this issue is to develop interpretable models by integrating
language, where classifiers are built using discrete attributes, similar to
human perception. This introduces a new challenge: how to effectively align
local visual features with corresponding attributes based on pre-trained VLMs.
To tackle this, we propose LaZSL, a locally-aligned vision-language model for
interpretable ZSL. LaZSL employs local visual-semantic alignment via optimal
transport to perform interaction between visual regions and their associated
attributes, facilitating effective alignment and providing interpretable
similarity without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method offers several advantages, including enhanced
interpretability, improved accuracy, and strong domain generalization. Codes

Conclusion: Flash-VStream在长视频理解任务中实现了高效和实时响应，性能领先。

Abstract: Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal
alignment, existing multimodal large language models have achieved prominent
performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding
of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in
significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long
videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world
applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these
issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of
processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time.
Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity
context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the
distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to
retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to
existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference
latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video
benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method. Code

Conclusion: NH2ST通过多模态和空间上下文整合，为基因表达预测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides crucial insights into tissue
micro-environments, but is limited to its high cost and complexity. As an
alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI)
is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on
single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial
and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g.,
gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among
adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address
these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and
both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model
comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch
and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and
contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure
alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six
datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods,
achieving over 20% in PCC metrics. Codes are available at

Motivation: 探索多头注意力机制在分类任务中的学习机制，并推广到大规模MHA（LS-MHA），以提升分类精度和效率。

Method: 通过单头性能（SHP）矩阵量化多头注意力的性能，分析其聚类特性，并设计新的视觉Transformer架构。

Conclusion: 该机制可推广至自然语言处理任务，为深度学习提供新见解，并在CIFAR-100数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking among a few heads of
multi-head attention (MHA) across transformer blocks in classification tasks
was recently demonstrated through the quantification of single-nodal
performance (SNP). This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention
on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying
learning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single
matrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to
single-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results
indicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each
label being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This
leads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,
thereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several
distinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy
but differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields
superior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on
hundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is
achieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer
blocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage
learning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers. The
extension of this learning mechanism to natural language processing tasks,
based on quantitative differences between CNNs and ViT architectures, has the
potential to yield new insights in deep learning. The findings are demonstrated
using compact convolutional transformer architectures trained on the CIFAR-100
dataset.

enables robust comparison across binary images of varying resolutions by
transforming them into marked point pattern representations. The key features
of the image, referred to as anchor points, are extracted from binary images by
identifying locally adaptive maxima from the minimal distance transform. Image
comparisons are then performed using a summary vector, capturing intensity,
connectivity, complexity, and structural attributes. Results show that this
approach provides an efficient and reliable method for image comparison,
particularly suited to applications requiring structural analysis across
different resolutions.

TL;DR: RAISE是一种利用3D生成先验恢复缺失视角下物体几何和外观的3D增强框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决场景重建中因视角缺失导致的高保真物体建模难题，以支持需要详细物体理解的下游任务。

Method: 通过3D生成模型生成代理物体，分两阶段优化几何和纹理：7-DOF位姿对齐和注册约束增强。

Result: 在视角合成和几何补全任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAISE能有效恢复缺失视角下的物体细节，同时保持场景一致性。

Abstract: Viewpoint missing of objects is common in scene reconstruction, as camera
paths typically prioritize capturing the overall scene structure rather than
individual objects. This makes it highly challenging to achieve high-fidelity
object-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation.
Addressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring
detailed object understanding and appearance modeling. In this paper, we
introduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement
framework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object
geometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting
degraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D
understanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning
each proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting
spatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained
enhancement. This two-stage refinement ensures the high-fidelity geometry and
appearance of the original object in unseen views while maintaining consistency
in spatial positioning, observed geometry, and appearance. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks show that RAISE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and geometry completion
tasks. RAISE is made publicly available at https://github.com/PolySummit/RAISE.

TL;DR: 论文提出了机器人生成内容（RGC）的概念，并建立了首个RGC视频数据库（RGCD），通过主观实验和基准测试揭示了现有视频质量评估（VQA）模型在RGC视频上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人平台的普及，机器人生成的视频（RGC）在流媒体平台上出现，但其独特的视觉需求和失真特性尚未得到专门研究。

Method: 建立了包含2,100个RGC视频的数据库（RGCD），进行了主观VQA实验，并评估了11种现有VQA模型的性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有VQA模型在复杂的RGC视频上表现不佳，需要开发专门的RGC-VQA模型。

Conclusion: 论文填补了RGC视频质量评估的空白，RGCD的公开为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: As camera-equipped robotic platforms become increasingly integrated into
daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media
platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We
innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term
these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual
quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC
videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly
from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated
content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC
videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic
applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD),
which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and
sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted
subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos.
Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11
state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal
significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex,
robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA
models. Our RGCD is publicly available at:

TL;DR: HiNeuS是一个统一框架，解决了神经表面重建中的多视角辐射不一致、无纹理区域关键点缺失以及Eikonal约束过强导致的结构退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景下难以兼顾几何保真度和光度一致性，HiNeuS旨在通过统一流程解决这些核心限制。

Method: 引入差分可见性验证、平面共形正则化和物理基础的Eikonal松弛，实现外观与几何约束的协同优化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，Chamfer距离减少21.4%，PSNR提高2.32 dB，并能恢复镜面反射和低纹理表面。

Conclusion: HiNeuS通过协同优化实现了高性能的表面重建，适用于逆向渲染任务。

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction faces persistent challenges in reconciling
geometric fidelity with photometric consistency under complex scene conditions.
We present HiNeuS, a unified framework that holistically addresses three core
limitations in existing approaches: multi-view radiance inconsistency, missing
keypoints in textureless regions, and structural degradation from over-enforced
Eikonal constraints during joint optimization. To resolve these issues through
a unified pipeline, we introduce: 1) Differential visibility verification
through SDF-guided ray tracing, resolving reflection ambiguities via continuous
occlusion modeling; 2) Planar-conformal regularization via ray-aligned geometry
patches that enforce local surface coherence while preserving sharp edges
through adaptive appearance weighting; and 3) Physically-grounded Eikonal
relaxation that dynamically modulates geometric constraints based on local
radiance gradients, enabling detail preservation without sacrificing global
regularity. Unlike prior methods that handle these aspects through sequential
optimizations or isolated modules, our approach achieves cohesive integration
where appearance-geometry constraints evolve synergistically throughout
training. Comprehensive evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, including a 21.4% reduction in
Chamfer distance over reflection-aware baselines and 2.32 dB PSNR improvement
against neural rendering counterparts. Qualitative analyses reveal superior
capability in recovering specular instruments, urban layouts with
centimeter-scale infrastructure, and low-textured surfaces without local patch
collapse. The method's generalizability is further validated through successful
application to inverse rendering tasks, including material decomposition and
view-consistent relighting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning (CaPT)，通过基于文本类别信息（TCI）的动态提示解决Base-New Tradeoff问题，显著提升模型在新任务上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉图像信息（VII）的条件提示调优方法性能不佳，甚至不如随机噪声条件提示。研究发现，基于文本类别信息（TCI）的动态提示是解决Base-New Tradeoff问题的关键。

Method: 提出CaPT方法，通过学习基于TCI的动态提示，快速适应新类别。CaPT可作为插件提升现有无条件提示调优方法的性能。

Result: 在11个数据集上，CaPT显著提升了五种无条件提示调优基线的性能，计算成本几乎可忽略。结合DePT框架的DeCaPT方法，性能超越现有最佳条件提示调优方案3.49%。

Conclusion: CaPT有效解决了Base-New Tradeoff问题，显著提升模型泛化能力，且计算成本低。

Abstract: Despite the great promise of Prompt Tuning (PT) in adapting large
Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) to downstream tasks, they often
struggle to overcome the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma: as VLPMs are better
tuned to a base task, their ability to generalize to new tasks diminishes.
Recent work on conditional PT addresses this problem by replacing static
prompts with dynamic Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts,
improving the model's generalization to new tasks to some extent. In this work,
we first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using
VII as the "condition" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even
random noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned
counterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts
conditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT
problem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning
(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by
learning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be
used as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT
schemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently
improves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with
negligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT
with our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT
approach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art
conditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets. Code:

TL;DR: VMoBA是一种针对视频扩散模型的稀疏注意力机制，通过动态块选择和优化，显著提升了训练和推理效率，同时保持或超越全注意力的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全注意力机制在视频扩散模型中的高计算复杂度问题，同时优化视频数据的时空特性捕捉。

Method: 引入VMoBA，结合层递进块划分、全局块选择和基于阈值的动态块选择，优化注意力机制。

Result: 训练速度提升2.92倍FLOPs和1.48倍延迟，推理速度提升2.40倍FLOPs和1.35倍延迟，生成质量与全注意力相当或更优。

Conclusion: VMoBA在效率和性能上均优于传统方法，适用于长序列视频生成。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant
bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration,
high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been
proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not
optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video
data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block
Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for
VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within
pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,
varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA
enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a
layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to
diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global
block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions
across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to
dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative
similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly
accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and
1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation
quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance
in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for
high-res video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DUST3R）的性能受限于训练数据的多样性和规模，因此需要一种能生成多样化数据的方法。

Method: 通过模拟多样化的相机轨迹和场景几何，对图像进行目标变换，生成大量高质量数据。

Result: 实验表明，Puzzles能显著提升性能，仅用10%的原始数据加Puzzles即可达到与完整数据集相当的精度。

Conclusion: Puzzles是一种高效的数据增强策略，无需修改网络架构即可提升3D重建性能。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision.
Recent methods, such as DUST3R and its successors, directly regress pointmaps
from image pairs without relying on known scene geometry or camera parameters.
However, the performance of these models is constrained by the diversity and
scale of available training data. In this work, we introduce Puzzles, a data
augmentation strategy that synthesizes an unbounded volume of high-quality
posed video-depth data from a single image or video clip. By simulating diverse
camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry through targeted image
transformations, Puzzles significantly enhances data variety. Extensive
experiments show that integrating Puzzles into existing video-based 3D
reconstruction pipelines consistently boosts performance without modifying the
underlying network architecture. Notably, models trained on only ten percent of
the original data augmented with Puzzles still achieve accuracy comparable to
those trained on the full dataset. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法易受虚假相关性误导，影响模型鲁棒性。

Method: 提出SPROD，通过后处理优化类别原型，减少虚假特征带来的偏差。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，AUROC提升4.7%，FPR@95降低9.3%。

Conclusion: SPROD能有效解决虚假相关性挑战，提升OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability
and safety of machine learning models in real-world applications, where they
frequently face data distributions unseen during training. Despite progress,
existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead
models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel
prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge
posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class
prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or
hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and
OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD
detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and
demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as
CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced
Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.7% and FPR@95 by 9.3%
over the second best.

TL;DR: PriOr-Flow提出了一种双分支框架，通过正交视图的低失真特性提升全景光流估计性能，特别是在极地区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于透视的光流方法在全景投影（如ERP）中因严重失真而性能下降，尤其在极地区域。

Method: 提出DCCL算子联合检索原始和正交成本体积的相关信息，并设计ODDC模块迭代优化运动特征。

Result: PriOr-Flow在公开全景光流数据集上表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: PriOr-Flow为宽视场运动估计设定了新基准，兼容多种迭代光流方法。

Abstract: Panoramic optical flow enables a comprehensive understanding of temporal
dynamics across wide fields of view. However, severe distortions caused by
sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP),
significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical
flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we
propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the
low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation
in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup
(DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the
primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise
during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion
Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both
branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based
iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a
new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation. The code is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估深度学习模型在不同脑影像队列中的泛化能力，重点关注年龄和性别这两个关键神经生物学标记。

Method: 使用三种三维架构（SFCN、DenseNet、Swin Transformer）在四个独立队列（UKB、DLBS、PPMI、IXI）中进行年龄和性别预测任务。

Result: SFCN在性别分类任务中表现最佳（AUC 1.00-0.85），在年龄预测任务中MAE为2.66-5.81，且显著优于Swin Transformer。

Conclusion: 简单的卷积网络在脑影像分析中比复杂架构更具优势，尤其是在跨数据集泛化能力方面。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are increasingly outperforming classical
approaches in brain imaging, yet their generalizability across diverse imaging
cohorts remains inadequately assessed. As age and sex are key neurobiological
markers in clinical neuroscience, influencing brain structure and disease risk,
this study evaluates three of the existing three-dimensional architectures,
namely Simple Fully Connected Network (SFCN), DenseNet, and Shifted Window
(Swin) Transformers, for age and sex prediction using T1-weighted MRI from four
independent cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB, n=47,390), Dallas Lifespan Brain Study
(DLBS, n=132), Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, n=108 healthy
controls), and Information eXtraction from Images (IXI, n=319). We found that
SFCN consistently outperformed more complex architectures with AUC of 1.00
[1.00-1.00] in UKB (internal test set) and 0.85-0.91 in external test sets for
sex classification. For the age prediction task, SFCN demonstrated a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 2.66 (r=0.89) in UKB and 4.98-5.81 (r=0.55-0.70) across
external datasets. Pairwise DeLong and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Bonferroni corrections confirmed SFCN's superiority over Swin Transformer
across most cohorts (p<0.017, for three comparisons). Explainability analysis
further demonstrates the regional consistency of model attention across cohorts
and specific to each task. Our findings reveal that simpler convolutional
networks outperform the denser and more complex attention-based DL
architectures in brain image analysis by demonstrating better generalizability
across different datasets.

Conclusion: 该范式有望推动更强大且与人类认知对齐的多模态AI发展，但仍需解决技术挑战。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by
textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning
within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a
static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich
perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends
language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution
is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that
merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This
emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as
intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive
input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart
this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive
autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool
exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To
structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions.
(1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm
and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the
core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the
critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications.
(4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.
By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for
future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

Result: 在RGB-Thermal、RGB-Depth和RGB-Event等多模态跟踪任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VMDA通过结合视觉和记忆适配器，显著提升了多模态跟踪的表现。

Abstract: Prompt-learning-based multi-modal trackers have achieved promising progress
by employing lightweight visual adapters to incorporate auxiliary modality
features into frozen foundation models. However, existing approaches often
struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues
across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative
representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but
effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from
auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency,
spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter
inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and
performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent
propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth,
and RGB-Event tracking. Code and models are available at

Result: 高相关性的概念生成更简短的解释，低相关性则生成更复杂的解释；解释在不同图像增强下表现不同的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究为构建更可解释和鲁棒的AI系统提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: Understanding why a classification model prefers one class over another for
an input instance is the challenge of contrastive explanation. This work
implements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by
leveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of
human-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our
approach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for
similar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based
on explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image
augmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation
complexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether
explanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as
rotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept
relevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance
results in longer, more diffuse explanations. Additionally, explanations show
varying degrees of robustness. The discussion of these findings offers insights
into the potential of building more interpretable and robust AI systems.

Dice score of 0.923 for amorphous catalyst samples and accuracy of 0.987, an
IOU of 0.857, and a Dice score of 0.923 for crystalline samples. These results
mark a substantial improvement over traditional methods like Otsu thresholding
and even advanced models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) when used in
isolation. Our results demonstrate that Zenesis is a powerful tool for
scientific applications, particularly in fields where high-quality annotated
datasets are unavailable, accelerating accurate analysis of experimental
imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的机制，将微调过程转换为特定参数生成，以解决目标检测器在环境变化中的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境在时间和空间上的变化对基于封闭集假设训练的目标检测器提出了挑战，需要一种方法在不影响其他参数的情况下提升泛化能力。

Method: 设计了双路径LoRA域感知适配器，分离域不变和域特定特征；提出条件扩散参数生成机制；采用类中心最优传输对齐方法减轻灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在多种连续域自适应目标检测任务中表现有效，生成的参数能捕捉更多目标相关信息并增强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过参数生成和特征分离，显著提升了目标检测器在动态环境中的适应性和泛化性能。

Abstract: In practice, environments constantly change over time and space, posing
significant challenges for object detectors trained based on a closed-set
assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same distribution. To this
end, continual test-time adaptation has attracted much attention, aiming to
improve detectors' generalization by fine-tuning a few specific parameters,
e.g., BatchNorm layers. However, based on a small number of test images,
fine-tuning certain parameters may affect the representation ability of other
fixed parameters, leading to performance degradation. Instead, we explore a new
mechanism, i.e., converting the fine-tuning process to a specific-parameter
generation. Particularly, we first design a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware
adapter that disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, enabling efficient adaptation. Additionally, a conditional
diffusion-based parameter generation mechanism is presented to synthesize the
adapter's parameters based on the current environment, preventing the
optimization from getting stuck in local optima. Finally, we propose a
class-centered optimal transport alignment method to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on various continuous domain
adaptive object detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness. Meanwhile,
visualization results show that the representation extracted by the generated
parameters can capture more object-related information and strengthen the
generalization ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在从高斯泼溅中提取表面网格时存在高成本、细节丢失或网格过密的问题，且后处理步骤限制了最终网格的质量。

Method: MILo设计了完全可微分的过程，直接从高斯参数中构建网格，包括顶点位置和连接性，并引入了双向一致性框架、自适应网格提取和基于高斯的有符号距离计算方法。

Result: 该方法能够以最先进的精度重建完整场景，且网格顶点数量比之前方法少一个数量级，适用于物理模拟或动画等下游应用。

Conclusion: MILo成功弥合了体积和表面表示之间的差距，提供了轻量且高质量的网格提取方案。

Abstract: While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction
of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes
remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly
post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or
requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of
vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to
a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all
geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel
Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and
surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D
Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the
mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration
directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities
optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical
contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both
representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying
geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each
training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay
triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D
Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric
erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds,
with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh
vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior,
our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics
simulations or animation.

Motivation: 现有的大多数标注数据集缺乏视觉实体的位置和关系信息，且高分辨率图像上的详细描述和对象描述不足。

Method: 设计了三阶段标注流程：开放世界感知、详细对象描述生成和密集描述合并，并提出了两个VLM模型（Detailed Region Caption模型和Spatial Caption Merging模型）。

Result: 实验表明，DenseWorld-1M数据集和标注模型在视觉语言理解、视觉定位和区域描述生成等任务中表现有效。

Conclusion: DenseWorld-1M为社区提供了一个大规模、详细且密集的标注数据集，解决了现有数据集的不足。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate a complex understanding
of scenes, benefiting from large-scale and high-quality datasets. Most existing
caption datasets lack the ground locations and relations for visual entities.
Several grounded caption datasets face the problems of missing detailed
descriptions, relations, and massive object descriptions on high-resolution
images. To fill this gap for the community, we present DenseWorld-1M, the first
massive, detailed, dense grounded caption dataset in the real world. We design
a three-stage labeling pipeline, containing open-world perception, detailed
object caption generation, and dense caption merging. The first stage obtains
entity-level masks and labels. The second stage generates the object-level,
detailed captions with the guidance of masks and labels from the first stage.
The final stage merges object captions and masks into spatial and relational
dense captions. To accelerate the labeling process and improve caption quality,
we present two VLM models: the Detailed Region Caption model and the Spatial
Caption Merging model. Extensive experiments on various settings, including
vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DenseWorld-1M dataset and labeling models.

Result: 实验显示FVD提升7.4%，预测时长显著延长，并在NAVSIM基准测试中优于端到端规划器。

Conclusion: Epona在视频生成和自动驾驶规划中均表现出色，代码将开源。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video
generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling.
However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with
flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning.
This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint
distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially
constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose
Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized
spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled
spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from
fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video
prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an
end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration
generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to
address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes
longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model
further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end
planners on NAVSIM benchmarks. Code will be publicly available at

Conclusion: TextMesh4D为文本驱动的4D网格生成提供了高效且高质量的解决方案，代码将开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion generative models significantly advanced
image, video, and 3D content creation from user-provided text prompts. However,
the challenging problem of dynamic 3D content generation (text-to-4D) with
diffusion guidance remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
TextMesh4D, a novel framework for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Our
approach leverages per-face Jacobians as a differentiable mesh representation
and decomposes 4D generation into two stages: static object creation and
dynamic motion synthesis. We further propose a flexibility-rigidity
regularization term to stabilize Jacobian optimization under video diffusion
priors, ensuring robust geometric performance. Experiments demonstrate that
TextMesh4D achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of temporal consistency,
structural fidelity, and visual realism. Moreover, TextMesh4D operates with a
low GPU memory overhead-requiring only a single 24GB GPU-offering a
cost-effective yet high-quality solution for text-driven 4D mesh generation.
The code will be released to facilitate future research in text-to-4D

Abstract: We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that
innovatively integrates advanced text customization with artistic typography
for digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of
precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our
framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a
self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image
generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically
construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a
localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which
comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from
reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to
directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing
the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's
accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph
positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography,
Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in
digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的隐式神经表示（INR）视频压缩方法RNeRV，通过优化组件设计和引入超网络，显著提升了压缩质量和编码速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统INR方法因需逐样本训练网络导致编码速度过慢，难以实用化。

Method: 开发库分析NeRV家族方法组件，提出RNeRV配置，并研究超网络预测INR权重以加速编码。

Result: RNeRV在相同训练时间下PSNR平均提升1.27%；超网络改进后PSNR和MS-SSIM分别提升1.7%和2.5%/2.7%。

Conclusion: RNeRV和超网络设计有效解决了INR视频压缩的编码速度问题，同时提升了质量。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) methods for video compression have
recently achieved visual quality and compression ratios that are competitive
with traditional pipelines. However, due to the need for per-sample network
training, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical
adoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the
components of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in
terms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.
We uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a
state-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When
all methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7
different UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared
to the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then
tackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of
hyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle
training from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the
weights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher
quality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at
0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by
0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar
speeds. Our project website is available at https://mgwillia.github.io/vinrb/

### [345] [Psycholinguistic Word Features: a New Approach for the Evaluation of LLMs Alignment with Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22439)
*Javier Conde,Miguel González,María Grandury,Gonzalo Martínez,Pedro Reviriego,Mar Brysbaert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过心理语言学数据集评估了LLMs与人类在词汇特征上的对齐程度，发现LLMs在感官关联方面的表现较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估多关注任务性能，而忽略了难以量化的语言特征（如情感、感官关联等）。本文旨在利用心理语言学数据集填补这一空白。

Method: 使用Glasgow和Lancaster两个心理语言学数据集，评估一组代表性LLMs在13个词汇特征上与人类评分的对齐程度。

Result: LLMs在Glasgow数据集（情感、熟悉度等）上的对齐表现优于Lancaster数据集（感官关联），表明其在感官关联方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: LLMs缺乏人类的具体认知能力，导致感官关联表现不佳，心理语言学数据集为LLM评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs has so far focused primarily on how well they can
perform different tasks such as reasoning, question-answering, paraphrasing, or
translating. For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with
objective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other
language features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,
concreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to
which we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.
Those features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,
conducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands
of words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human
ratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover
many different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we
evaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on
two psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets
cover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that
alignment is \textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated
(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and
gender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,
olfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation
of current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which
may be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and
illustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.

Motivation: 现有解决方案主要针对非结构化文本或有限的合规性检查，无法满足企业文档的高效审查需求。

Method: 采用LangChain、CrewAI、TruLens和Guidance等现代编排工具，通过并行或顺序运行的专门智能体进行文档审查。

Result: AI系统在一致性（99% vs. 人类92%）、错误率和偏见率减半、审查时间从30分钟降至2.5分钟等方面表现优于人类。

Conclusion: 该系统为企业在AI驱动的文档质量保证方面提供了灵活、可审计和可扩展的基础，但仍需在高度专业化领域进行人工监督。

Abstract: This study presents a modular, multi-agent system for the automated review of
highly structured enterprise business documents using AI agents. Unlike prior
solutions focused on unstructured texts or limited compliance checks, this
framework leverages modern orchestration tools such as LangChain, CrewAI,
TruLens, and Guidance to enable section-by-section evaluation of documents for
accuracy, consistency, completeness, and clarity. Specialized agents, each
responsible for discrete review criteria such as template compliance or factual
correctness, operate in parallel or sequence as required. Evaluation outputs
are enforced to a standardized, machine-readable schema, supporting downstream
analytics and auditability. Continuous monitoring and a feedback loop with
human reviewers allow for iterative system improvement and bias mitigation.
  Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the AI Agent-as-Judge system
approaches or exceeds human performance in key areas: achieving 99% information
consistency (vs. 92% for humans), halving error and bias rates, and reducing
average review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes per document, with a 95% agreement
rate between AI and expert human judgment. While promising for a wide range of
industries, the study also discusses current limitations, including the need
for human oversight in highly specialized domains and the operational cost of
large-scale LLM usage. The proposed system serves as a flexible, auditable, and
scalable foundation for AI-driven document quality assurance in the enterprise
context.

Conclusion: 多个小型语言模型可有效验证LLM生成的回答，为学术和实际应用提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions
through retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a
vectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses.
However, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in
practical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of
ground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper
proposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify
responses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized
database. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and
utilizing the probability of generating "Yes" tokens from the outputs of
multiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,
hallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through
experiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,
and contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.
The results demonstrate a 10\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct
responses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language
models can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a
scalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.

Motivation: 社交媒体冲突检测需要高质量标注数据，但这类数据稀缺且昂贵，同时LLM的防护机制限制了冲突相关数据的生成。

Method: 提出PromptAug，一种创新的LLM数据增强方法，通过极端数据稀缺场景、多样性分析和主题分析进行综合评估。

Result: PromptAug在冲突和情感数据集上实现了2%的准确性和F1分数提升，并识别了增强文本中的四种问题模式。

Conclusion: PromptAug为敏感任务（如冲突检测）提供了一种有效的数据增强方法，结合了自然语言处理和社会科学方法进行跨学科评估。

Abstract: Given the rise of conflicts on social media, effective classification models
to detect harmful behaviours are essential. Following the
garbage-in-garbage-out maxim, machine learning performance depends heavily on
training data quality. However, high-quality labelled data, especially for
nuanced tasks like identifying conflict behaviours, is limited, expensive, and
difficult to obtain. Additionally, as social media platforms increasingly
restrict access to research data, text data augmentation is gaining attention
as an alternative to generate training data. Augmenting conflict-related data
poses unique challenges due to Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails that
prevent generation of offensive content. This paper introduces PromptAug, an
innovative LLM-based data augmentation method. PromptAug achieves statistically
significant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and
emotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data
augmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity
scenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.
The thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:
Linguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and
Augmented Content Misinterpretation.
  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting
data in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,
interdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and
social science methodology.

Conclusion: AgentStealth提供了一种高效、隐私安全的本地化匿名化方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In today's digital world, casual user-generated content often contains subtle
cues that may inadvertently expose sensitive personal attributes. Such risks
underscore the growing importance of effective text anonymization to safeguard
individual privacy. However, existing methods either rely on rigid replacements
that damage utility or cloud-based LLMs that are costly and pose privacy risks.
To address these issues, we explore the use of locally deployed smaller-scale
language models (SLMs) for anonymization. Yet training effective SLMs remains
challenging due to limited high-quality supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First,
we introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context
Contrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform
supervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the
workflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals. Finally, we
apply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal
adversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.
Experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both
anonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight
design supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and
communication-based privacy risks. Our code is open-source at

Conclusion: MDGCL通过有效处理领域差异，显著提升了图基础模型的性能，为多领域图数据预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing
(NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to
integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target
domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is
ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and
recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm
to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However,
unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of
graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional
contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario,
which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From
experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific
differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from
different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework,
namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning
strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and
introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the
downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable
fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\%
on Macro-F1 score.

Abstract: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides a quantitative framework for
explaining consciousness phenomenon, positing that conscious systems comprise
elements integrated through causal properties. We apply IIT 3.0 and 4.0 -- the
latest iterations of this framework -- to sequences of Large Language Model
(LLM) representations, analyzing data derived from existing Theory of Mind
(ToM) test results. Our study systematically investigates whether the
differences of ToM test performances, when presented in the LLM
representations, can be revealed by IIT estimates, i.e., $\Phi^{\max}$ (IIT
3.0), $\Phi$ (IIT 4.0), Conceptual Information (IIT 3.0), and $\Phi$-structure
(IIT 4.0). Furthermore, we compare these metrics with the Span Representations
independent of any estimate for consciousness. This additional effort aims to
differentiate between potential "consciousness" phenomena and inherent
separations within LLM representational space. We conduct comprehensive
experiments examining variations across LLM transformer layers and linguistic
spans from stimuli. Our results suggest that sequences of contemporary
Transformer-based LLM representations lack statistically significant indicators
of observed "consciousness" phenomena but exhibit intriguing patterns under
$\textit{spatio}$-permutational analyses. The Appendix and code are available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG)方法，通过LLM反馈改进检索器质量，并重组检索结果以提升图基RAG性能。实验显示ReG显著提升效果，减少推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图基RAG中检索器因缺乏真实标注和抽象图数据导致的性能问题。

Method: 结合LLM反馈消除虚假信号，引入结构感知重组模块整理检索结果。

Result: ReG在不同LLM上提升性能达10%，减少训练数据需求，降低推理成本30%。

Conclusion: ReG有效提升图基RAG性能，减少资源消耗，适用于分布外知识图谱。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language
models (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from
up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs
often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground
truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often
introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph
data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To
mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak
retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM
feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the
supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module
to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.
Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and
consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.
The improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art
performance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.
Notably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token
cost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Telegram等低监管平台成为虚假信息传播渠道，但连通性和消息传播信息在虚假信息检测中未充分利用。

Method: 构建包含500万条消息的数据集，结合语义相似度和人工标注生成标签，评估文本模型和图神经网络（如GraphSAGE）。

Result: GraphSAGE结合LSTM聚合在MCC和F1分数上显著优于纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为德语Telegram网络虚假信息检测提供了可复现基准和开放数据集。

Abstract: Connectivity and message propagation are central, yet often underutilized,
sources of information in misinformation detection -- especially on poorly
moderated platforms such as Telegram, which has become a critical channel for
misinformation dissemination, namely in the German electoral context. In this
paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based
graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages
from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both
weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to
fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual
annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only
models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as
a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation
significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers,
view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and
highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.
This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future
research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and
other low-moderation social platforms.

*Nicholas Edwards,Yukyung Lee,Yujun,Mao,Yulu Qin,Sebastian Schuster,Najoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了RExBench，一个用于评估LLM代理在实现研究扩展任务能力的基准测试，结果显示当前代理仍需大量人工指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩展能力是LLM代理的关键能力，但现有代理在此方面的表现尚未被充分评估。

Method: 开发了RExBench基准，包含12个未实现的研究假设任务，并评估了9个基于不同框架的LLM代理。

Result: 所有代理在自主实现扩展任务时表现不佳，成功率低于40%，即使有人工提示。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理在无大量人工指导的情况下，仍难以胜任现实研究扩展任务。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for
performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition,
there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the
research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that
research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such
systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability.
RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment
implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not
previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing
research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions.
RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation
infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success
criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented
using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find
that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the
extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written
hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This
indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic
research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

Conclusion: 本研究为合成文本检测提供了一种有效的水印方法，有助于LLMs的伦理应用。

Abstract: In the present-day scenario, Large Language Models (LLMs) are establishing
their presence as powerful instruments permeating various sectors of society.
While their utility offers valuable support to individuals, there are multiple
concerns over potential misuse. Consequently, some academic endeavors have
sought to introduce watermarking techniques, characterized by the inclusion of
markers within machine-generated text, to facilitate algorithmic
identification. This research project is focused on the development of a novel
methodology for the detection of synthetic text, with the overarching goal of
ensuring the ethical application of LLMs in AI-driven text generation. The
investigation commences with replicating findings from a previous baseline
study, thereby underscoring its susceptibility to variations in the underlying
generation model. Subsequently, we propose an innovative watermarking approach
and subject it to rigorous evaluation, employing paraphrased generated text to
asses its robustness. Experimental results highlight the robustness of our
proposal compared to the~\cite{aarson} watermarking method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合稀疏（BM25）和密集（E5）检索方法的混合RAG系统，使用Falcon3-10B-Instruct生成答案，并通过RankLLaMA重新排序提升性能，但计算成本较高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态测试集上检索增强生成（RAG）系统的性能问题，特别是在忠实性和正确性方面的挑战。

Method: 结合BM25和E5检索方法，使用Falcon3-10B-Instruct生成答案，并通过RankLLaMA进行神经重新排序。

Result: 神经重新排序将MAP从0.523提升至0.797（52%相对提升），但计算成本显著增加（84秒vs1.74秒/问题）。混合系统在忠实性排名第4，正确性排名第11。

Conclusion: 词汇对齐是性能的关键预测因素，但需权衡计算成本和性能提升。

Abstract: We present our submission to the LiveRAG Challenge 2025, which evaluates
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on dynamic test sets using the
FineWeb-10BT corpus. Our final hybrid approach combines sparse (BM25) and dense
(E5) retrieval methods and then aims to generate relevant and faithful answers
with Falcon3-10B-Instruct. Through systematic evaluation on 200 synthetic
questions generated with DataMorgana across 64 unique question-user
combinations, we demonstrate that neural re-ranking with RankLLaMA improves MAP
from 0.523 to 0.797 (52% relative improvement) but introduces prohibitive
computational costs (84s vs 1.74s per question). While DSPy-optimized prompting
strategies achieved higher semantic similarity (0.771 vs 0.668), their 0%
refusal rates raised concerns about over-confidence and generalizability. Our
submitted hybrid system without re-ranking achieved 4th place in faithfulness
and 11th place in correctness among 25 teams. Analysis across question
categories reveals that vocabulary alignment between questions and documents
was the strongest predictor of performance on our development set, with
document-similar phrasing improving cosine similarity from 0.562 to 0.762.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在分析高压力环境（如太空任务）中团队沟通动态的潜力，尤其是在仅能获取文本数据的情况下。

Method: 比较了零样本分类、微调、增强微调的编码器模型（RoBERTa、DistilBERT）与少样本生成的解码器模型（Llama-3.1）的性能。

Result: 解码器模型Llama-3.1表现最佳，宏F1分数在3类和2类分类中分别达到44%和68%。

Conclusion: 解码器模型更适合检测团队对话中的细微行为，对开发分析团队沟通的语音技术有重要意义。

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of large language models (LLMs) in detecting
subtle expressions of micro-behaviors in team conversations using transcripts
collected during simulated space missions. Specifically, we examine zero-shot
classification, fine-tuning, and paraphrase-augmented fine-tuning with
encoder-only sequence classification LLMs, as well as few-shot text generation
with decoder-only causal language modeling LLMs, to predict the micro-behavior
associated with each conversational turn (i.e., dialogue). Our findings
indicate that encoder-only LLMs, such as RoBERTa and DistilBERT, struggled to
detect underrepresented micro-behaviors, particularly discouraging speech, even
with weighted fine-tuning. In contrast, the instruction fine-tuned version of
Llama-3.1, a decoder-only LLM, demonstrated superior performance, with the best
models achieving macro F1-scores of 44% for 3-way classification and 68% for
binary classification. These results have implications for the development of
speech technologies aimed at analyzing team communication dynamics and
enhancing training interventions in high-stakes environments such as space
missions, particularly in scenarios where text is the only accessible data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的简单技术VocabTrim，通过优化drafter模型的词汇表来提高基于drafter的推测解码（SpD）性能，减少内存受限环境下的推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码通常要求目标模型和drafter模型的词汇表一一对应，导致在大词汇表目标模型上存在不必要的推理开销。VocabTrim旨在减少这种开销，提升生成速度。

Method: VocabTrim通过重构drafter的语言模型头（LM head），仅包含目标模型词汇表中高频采样的有限词汇，以减少推理延迟。

Result: 实验表明，VocabTrim在Llama-3模型上实现了16%的内存受限加速（MBSU），如Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct。

Conclusion: VocabTrim是一种简单有效的方法，显著减少了推测解码的内存受限延迟，提升了生成效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a recent interdisciplinary workshop
that brought together leading experts in cognitive psychology, language
learning, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing
(NLP). The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to
address a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the relationship
between AI language models and human cognitive processes in text comprehension
and composition. Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic,
and technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying
processes involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both
inform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The
workshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language
models (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of
LLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language
understanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to
offer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between
LLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with
human feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI
collaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report
aims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in
cognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance
of ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving
to enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through
effective human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言生成中，中低资源语言质量较差，原因是模型隐含的任务解决-翻译流程中翻译阶段失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在多语言生成中质量低下的原因，尤其是中低资源语言。

Method: 通过观察模型在中间层的处理（使用logit lens），测试翻译障碍假设，分析108种语言对的单词翻译任务。

Result: 翻译失败是导致整体失败的重要原因，尤其是低资源目标语言。

Conclusion: 翻译障碍是多语言生成的重要障碍，为未来改进LLMs的多语言能力提供了指导。

Abstract: Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor
quality for mid- to low-resource languages. Building on insights from
interpretability, we demonstrate the existence of an implicit
task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first
solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and
subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We
hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage is an important culprit
for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the
translation barrier hypothesis. We test this hypothesis for a word translation
task across 108 language pairs, using logit lens to observe model processing in
intermediate layers. We find that a significant portion of overall failures
indeed stems from translation failure, or the model's inability to translate
correctly solved intermediate concepts into the target language. This is
especially true for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an
important hurdle for end-to-end multilingual generation, and lend guiding
insights for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VFT的预RL干预方法，通过训练模型明确承认提示线索的影响，显著提高了奖励黑客行为的检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在RL训练中可能利用奖励黑客行为（即通过非预期策略获取高奖励）的问题，尤其是在高风险应用中，这种行为难以通过思维链推理检测。

Method: 提出VFT方法，在RL训练前对模型进行干预，训练其明确承认提示线索的影响。随后在RL环境中评估模型是否利用线索进行奖励黑客行为。

Result: VFT训练的模型在RL后仅有6%的未检测奖励黑客行为，而未经VFT的模型高达88%。VFT显著提高了模型对线索影响的明确承认率（从8%提升至94%）。

Conclusion: VFT通过提高模型对奖励黑客行为的明确承认，显著改善了检测能力，为构建更透明和安全的AI系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Language models trained with RL can engage in reward hacking--exploiting
unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their
chain-of-thought reasoning, making detection difficult and posing risks for
high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL
intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are
influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a
Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently
train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which
incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack
by exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models
exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained
model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we
perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;
with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT
achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the
influence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while
baselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%). Our results show that teaching
models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly
improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and
safe AI systems.

TL;DR: ContextCache是一种上下文感知的语义缓存系统，通过两阶段检索架构优化多轮对话中的缓存命中率，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义缓存系统缺乏对多轮对话上下文的感知，导致相似查询在不同对话场景中出现错误的缓存命中。

Method: 采用两阶段检索架构：首先基于向量检索当前查询，然后通过自注意力机制整合当前和历史对话表示进行精确匹配。

Result: ContextCache在真实对话中表现出更高的精确率和召回率，缓存响应延迟比直接调用LLM低约10倍。

Conclusion: ContextCache显著提升了多轮对话中的语义缓存效率，为LLM对话应用节省了计算成本。

Abstract: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves
efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses.
However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries,
lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect
cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings.
This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching
system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval
architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to
identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue
representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual
matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache
improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally,
cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM
invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM
conversational applications.

We systematically establish a hierarchical taxonomy integrating global medical
ethical standards. The benchmark encompasses widely used medical datasets,
authoritative question banks, and scenarios derived from PubMed literature.
Rigorous quality control involving multi-stage filtering and multi-faceted
expert validation ensures the reliability of the dataset with a low error rate
($2.72\%$). Evaluation of state-of-the-art MedLLMs exhibit declined performance
in answering medical ethics questions compared to their foundation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多领域训练统一模型缺乏适应性和扩展性，标注细粒度标签和训练领域特定模型成本高。

Method: SaM框架动态选择预训练的领域专家模型，基于领域相似性和性能样本合并，创建任务特定模型。

Result: 实验证明SaM框架在多个基准测试中平均优于统一模型10%，且具有高扩展性。

Conclusion: SaM框架通过动态合并专家模型显著提升跨领域泛化能力，并支持灵活扩展。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models
(LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition
(NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training
domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified
model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and
scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling
trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which
dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically,
for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing
domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii)
performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to
create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically
merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across
various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or
removed conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which
outperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights

### [366] [Boosting CTC-Based ASR Using LLM-Based Intermediate Loss Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22846)
*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LAIL的辅助损失框架，通过利用大型语言模型的语义知识增强CTC-based ASR的语义建模能力，同时保持其计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CTC-based ASR模型在语义依赖建模上的不足，同时保持其非自回归解码的高效性。

Method: 在中间编码层添加连接层，将输出映射到大型语言模型的嵌入空间，并计算因果语言建模损失。

Result: 在LibriSpeech、TEDLIUM2和WSJ语料库上显著降低了词错误率（WER），达到了CTC-based ASR的最先进性能。

Conclusion: LAIL框架有效提升了CTC-based ASR的语义建模能力，且计算开销极小。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have
revolutionized the field by integrating all components into a single neural
network, with attention-based encoder-decoder models achieving state-of-the-art
performance. However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference
speed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast,
CTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to
model linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we
propose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate
Loss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large
language models (LLMs). By attaching connector layers to intermediate encoder
layers, LAIL maps outputs to the embedding space of an LLM and computes a
causal language modeling loss during training. This approach enhances
linguistic modeling while preserving the computational efficiency of CTC
decoding. Using the Conformer architecture and various LLaMA models, we
demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on the
LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ corpora, achieving state-of-the-art performance
for CTC-based ASR with minimal computational overhead.

### [367] [Knowledge Augmented Finetuning Matters in both RAG and Agent Based Dialog Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22852)
*Yucheng Cai,Yuxuan Wu,Yi Huang,Junlan Feng,Zhijian Ou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出知识增强微调（KAFT）方法，通过在检索增强生成（RAG）和基于代理的系统中使用领域特定数据和外部知识微调大语言模型（LLMs），显著提高了事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在知识密集型场景中易出错，现有方法如RAG和代理系统虽能提升事实准确性，但LLMs在利用检索知识生成响应时仍有困难。

Method: 提出KAFT方法，结合领域特定数据和外部知识微调LLMs，并在MobileCS2数据集上比较KAFT与提示技术的效果。

Result: 实验表明，KAFT在RAG和代理系统中均显著优于提示技术，尤其在事实准确性方面。

Conclusion: KAFT是首个实证研究该方法的论文，为提升LLMs在知识密集型任务中的表现提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems.
Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs
with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly
implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved
knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge
effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do
such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to
finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific
data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called
knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2
dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive
knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT
techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show
that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems,
particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.

*Kyochul Jang,Donghyeon Lee,Kyusik Kim,Dongseok Heo,Taewhoo Lee,Woojeong Kim,Bongwon Suh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出DICE-SCORE指标和DICE-BENCH框架，用于评估和构建更贴近现实场景的多轮函数调用数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有函数调用基准测试仅关注单轮交互，忽略了现实场景的复杂性。

Method: 引入DICE-SCORE指标评估工具相关信息的分散程度，并通过工具图和多代理系统构建DICE-BENCH数据集。

Result: 实验显示现有基准测试得分低，19个LLM在DICE-BENCH上表现仍需改进。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以提升LLM在现实场景中的函数调用能力。

Abstract: Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions.
However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how
existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a
metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as
function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing
benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need
for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a
framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing
conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds
and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue
naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our
experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still
required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

### [369] [Mind the Gap: Entity-Preserved Context-Aware ASR Structured Transcriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22858)
*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的ASR训练方法，通过增加重叠上下文窗口和实体标签，显著提升了命名实体和数值数据的识别与格式化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统（如Whisper）在命名实体和数值数据识别及格式化方面表现不佳，影响关键领域（如法律、金融、医疗）的语义理解。

Method: 采用重叠上下文窗口训练（5秒重叠，30秒块，形成40秒有效语义窗口），并重新分配跨块实体至右侧块，同时嵌入实体标签以学习格式化。

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上，该方法显著提升了命名实体识别（NER）和实体格式化等语义任务的性能。

Conclusion: 上下文感知训练能有效解决ASR在长文本转录和复杂实体识别任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, such as Whisper, achieve high
transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data,
especially when proper formatting is required. These issues increase word error
rate (WER) and impair semantic understanding in critical domains like legal,
financial, and medical applications. We propose a novel training approach that
extends the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping context
windows during training. By sliding 5-second overlaps on both sides of
30-second chunks, we create a 40-second "effective semantic window," improving
entity recognition and formatting while focusing predictions on the central 30
seconds. To address entities spanning chunk boundaries, we reassign such
entities entirely to the right-hand chunk, ensuring proper formatting.
Additionally, enriched training data with embedded entity labels enables the
model to learn both recognition and type-specific formatting. Evaluated on the
Spoken Wikipedia dataset, our method improves performance across semantic
tasks, including named entity recognition (NER) and entity formatting. These
results highlight the effectiveness of context-aware training in addressing ASR
limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition tasks.

*Younwoo Choi,Changling Li,Yongjin Yang,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）的对话伙伴意识（interlocutor awareness），即LLM识别和适应对话伙伴身份和特征的能力，并首次系统评估了当代LLM中这一能力的表现。研究发现LLM能可靠识别同类模型（如GPT和Claude），并通过案例研究展示了这一能力在多LLM协作中的潜力及安全性风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在多代理和人类-AI系统中的广泛应用，理解其对自身上下文和对话伙伴的意识能力对确保可靠性能和安全性至关重要。此前研究主要关注情境意识（situational awareness），而忽视了对话伙伴意识。

Method: 论文将对话伙伴意识定义为LLM识别和适应对话伙伴身份和特征的能力，并从推理模式、语言风格和对齐偏好三个维度系统评估当代LLM的表现。

Result: 研究发现LLM能可靠识别同类模型（如GPT和Claude）。通过三个案例研究，展示了对话伙伴意识在多LLM协作中的潜力（如通过提示适应提升协作效率）及安全性风险（如奖励操纵行为和越狱漏洞增加）。

Conclusion: 对话伙伴意识在LLM中具有双重性，既可能提升协作效率，也可能引入新的安全漏洞。研究强调需要进一步理解这一能力，并在多代理部署中采取新的安全措施。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent
and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and
conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and
robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness
which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and
constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify
and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this
paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and
present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.
We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,
linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably
identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT
and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case
studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration
through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety
vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak
susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of
identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further
understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent
deployments. Our code is open-sourced at

*Asen Dotsinski,Udit Thakur,Marko Ivanov,Mohammad Hafeez Khan,Maria Heuss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文复现了Ortu等人（2024）关于语言模型处理事实与反事实信息竞争的研究，验证了其核心发现，并扩展到更大模型、不同提示结构和特定领域，发现注意力头消融方法的有效性受模型架构、提示结构和领域影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型中事实与反事实信息的竞争机制，验证并扩展Ortu等人的发现。

Method: 复现实验并扩展到更大模型（Llama 3.1 8B），测试不同提示结构和特定领域。

Result: 发现注意力头专业化在更大模型中减弱，提示结构影响反事实标记的logit，特定领域提示会扭曲结果。

Conclusion: 注意力头消融方法的有效性因模型架构、提示结构和领域而异，需谨慎应用。

Abstract: We present a reproduction study of "Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How
Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals" (Ortu et al., 2024), which
investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual
recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully
reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and
counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism
competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing
information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)
and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three
significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these
findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B
(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head
specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by
introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement
verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the
logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the
authors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain
categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction
token as part of the subject of the sentence. Overall, we find that the
attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for
domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness
varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task.

Result: 通过实验验证了不同变体的性能，提出了多项设计建议。

Conclusion: 论文为组合式SLMs的设计提供了实用指导，并开源了代码。

Abstract: Syntactic language models (SLMs) enhance Transformers by incorporating
syntactic biases through the modeling of linearized syntactic parse trees
alongside surface sentences. This paper focuses on compositional SLMs that are
based on constituency parse trees and contain explicit bottom-up composition of
constituent representations. We identify key aspects of design choices in
existing compositional SLMs and propose a unified framework encompassing both
existing models and novel variants. We conduct a comprehensive empirical
evaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling,
syntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency.
Based on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the
design of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SoMi-ToM是一个评估多智能体复杂社交互动中多视角心智理论（ToM）能力的基准，填补了现有静态文本基准的不足。通过第一人称和第三人称视角的多模态数据评估，发现当前大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在ToM能力上显著落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ToM基准多为静态文本场景，与真实动态社交互动存在显著差距，需开发更贴近现实的评估方法。

Method: 基于SoMi环境生成的多模态互动数据，设计第一人称和第三人称视角的多层次评估框架，包含视频、图像和专家标注问题。

Result: LVLMs在SoMi-ToM上的表现显著低于人类，第一人称和第三人称评估的平均准确率差距分别为40.1%和26.4%。

Conclusion: 未来LVLMs需提升在具身复杂社交互动中的ToM能力，SoMi-ToM为此提供了有效评估工具。

Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by
perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions.
However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based
scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We
propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in
embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on
rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,
covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework
supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides
multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person
perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person
evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records
after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for
a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the
subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We
constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective
videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated
multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically
evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large
vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform
significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between
humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person
evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM
capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

Motivation: 巴西葡萄牙语缺乏高质量的NER数据集，尤其是在历史文本领域，影响了数字人文研究的进展。

Method: 构建了MariNER数据集，包含9000多句手动标注的历史文本句子，并评估了现有NER模型在该数据集上的表现。

Result: MariNER是首个针对20世纪初巴西葡萄牙语历史文本的黄金标准NER数据集，填补了资源空白。

Conclusion: MariNER为巴西葡萄牙语历史文本的NER研究提供了重要资源，并展示了现有模型在该领域的适用性。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing
(NLP) task that aims to identify and classify entity mentions in texts across
different categories. While languages such as English possess a large number of
high-quality resources for this task, Brazilian Portuguese still lacks in
quantity of gold-standard NER datasets, especially when considering specific
domains. Particularly, this paper considers the importance of NER for analyzing
historical texts in the context of digital humanities. To address this gap,
this work outlines the construction of MariNER: \textit{Mapeamento e
Anota\c{c}\~oes de Registros hIst\'oricos para NER} (Mapping and Annotation of
Historical Records for NER), the first gold-standard dataset for early
20th-century Brazilian Portuguese, with more than 9,000 manually annotated
sentences. We also assess and compare the performance of state-of-the-art NER
models for the dataset.

Result: 实验显示性能显著提升，GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4o的准确率提高了20%以上。

Conclusion: K-MSE框架有效解决了LLMs在分子结构解析中的知识不足问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation involves deducing a molecule's structure from
various types of spectral data, which is crucial in chemical experimental
analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency
in analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter
substantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation. We identify that
these challenges largely stem from LLMs' limited grasp of specialized chemical
knowledge. In this work, we introduce a Knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework
for Molecular Structure Elucidation (K-MSE), leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search
for test-time scaling as a plugin. Specifically, we construct an external
molecular substructure knowledge base to extend the LLMs' coverage of the
chemical structure space. Furthermore, we design a specialized
molecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process,
addressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly boosts performance, particularly
gaining more than 20% improvement on both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o. Our code is

TL;DR: Text2VectorSQL框架结合Text-to-SQL与向量搜索，解决非结构化数据和模糊查询的问题，提升语义检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL对非结构化数据和模糊查询效果不佳，而向量搜索虽强大但缺乏自动化评估框架。

Method: 提出Text2VectorSQL，支持语义过滤、多模态匹配和检索加速，并通过自动标注和专家评审构建评估框架。

Result: 实验显示Text2VectorSQL显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Text2VectorSQL为更灵活直观的数据库接口奠定了基础。

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL enables natural language interaction with structured
databases, its effectiveness diminishes with unstructured data or ambiguous
queries due to rigid syntax and limited expressiveness. Concurrently, vector
search has emerged as a powerful paradigm for semantic retrieval, particularly
for unstructured data. However, existing VectorSQL implementations still rely
heavily on manual crafting and lack tailored evaluation frameworks, leaving a
significant gap between theoretical potential and practical deployment. To
bridge these complementary paradigms, we introduces Text2VectorSQL, a novel
framework unifying Text-to-SQL and vector search to overcome expressiveness
constraints and support more diverse and holistical natural language queries.
Specifically, Text2VectorSQL enables semantic filtering, multi-modal matching,
and retrieval acceleration. For evaluation, we build vector index on
appropriate columns, extend user queries with semantic search, and annotate
ground truths via an automatic pipeline with expert review. Furthermore, we
develop dedicated Text2VectorSQL models with synthetic data, demonstrating
significant performance improvements over baseline methods. Our work
establishes the foundation for the Text2VectorSQL task, paving the way for more
versatile and intuitive database interfaces. The repository will be publicly
available at https://github.com/Open-DataFlow/Text2VectorSQL.

Result: 实验显示，开源和闭源模型均存在单场景中未显现的、情境敏感的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 关系感知的基准对诊断互动驱动的性别偏见至关重要，为未来偏见缓解提供方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing
concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias,
particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks
predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may
emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going
beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of
relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We
introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs
through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres
assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation
task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias
evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and
closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are
not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the
importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle,
interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for
future bias mitigation.

TL;DR: INDIC-BIAS是一个针对印度文化多样性的公平性基准，评估了14个LLM在85个身份群体中的表现，发现模型对边缘化群体存在强烈偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性研究主要关注西方文化，无法满足印度等多元文化国家的需求。

Method: 通过专家咨询和手动验证，生成了20,000个真实场景模板，分为三类任务（合理性、判断和生成）评估LLM。

Result: LLM对边缘化身份表现出强烈负面偏见，且难以通过理性化减少偏见。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁在印度背景下更谨慎地使用LLM，并开源INDIC-BIAS以推动相关研究。

Abstract: Existing studies on fairness are largely Western-focused, making them
inadequate for culturally diverse countries such as India. To address this gap,
we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to
evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse
castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to
curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations,
where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we
generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe
LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks:
plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on
these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities,
with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find
that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize
their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and
representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities,
calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release
INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and
mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context.

Motivation: 网络迷因中的叙事角色识别具有挑战性，尤其是文化特定性和语言多样性增加了任务的复杂性。

Method: 通过扩展和平衡标注数据集，评估了多种模型（如多语言Transformer、多模态视觉语言模型等），并在零样本设置下使用精确率、召回率和F1分数进行性能评估。

Result: 大型模型（如DeBERTa-v3和Qwen2.5-VL）表现较好，但在识别“受害者”角色和跨文化内容时仍存在挑战。混合提示策略能带来小幅改进。

Conclusion: 文化背景、提示工程和多模态推理对建模视觉-文本内容中的叙事框架至关重要。

Abstract: This work investigates the challenging task of identifying narrative roles -
Hero, Villain, Victim, and Other - in Internet memes, across three diverse test
sets spanning English and code-mixed (English-Hindi) languages. Building on an
annotated dataset originally skewed toward the 'Other' class, we explore a more
balanced and linguistically diverse extension, originally introduced as part of
the CLEF 2024 shared task. Comprehensive lexical and structural analyses
highlight the nuanced, culture-specific, and context-rich language used in real
memes, in contrast to synthetically curated hateful content, which exhibits
explicit and repetitive lexical markers. To benchmark the role detection task,
we evaluate a wide spectrum of models, including fine-tuned multilingual
transformers, sentiment and abuse-aware classifiers, instruction-tuned LLMs,
and multimodal vision-language models. Performance is assessed under zero-shot
settings using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. While larger models like
DeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate notable gains, results reveal consistent
challenges in reliably identifying the 'Victim' class and generalising across
cultural and code-mixed content. We also explore prompt design strategies to
guide multimodal models and find that hybrid prompts incorporating structured
instructions and role definitions offer marginal yet consistent improvements.
Our findings underscore the importance of cultural grounding, prompt
engineering, and multimodal reasoning in modelling subtle narrative framings in
visual-textual content.

Conclusion: Embodied Planner-R1通过自主探索和强化学习显著提升了LLMs在具身任务规划中的表现和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, yet they face significant challenges in embodied task planning
scenarios that require continuous environmental understanding and action
generation. Existing approaches generate open-loop action scripts based on
static knowledge, making it difficult to learn causal relationships between
actions and environmental feedback, particularly in partially observable
environments. We introduce Embodied Planner-R1, a novel outcome-driven
reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to develop interactive
capabilities through autonomous exploration with minimal supervision. Our
framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Without human annotations, we
employ pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, incorporating
in-environment interaction through parallel exploration; (2) completion-driven
sparse reward; and (3) Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient
learning from grouped trajectories. Across two challenging text-based Embodied
planning benchmarks, Embodied Planner-R1 achieves impressive completion rates
of 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, surpassing prior methods by a
large margin, and suffers only a -3.66% drop in previously unseen environments,
evidencing strong generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖人工标注格式的问题，降低标注成本并提高任务适应性。

Method: 提出测量推理误差的方法，并开发Format-Adapter，利用LLMs生成和选择最优推理格式。

Result: 在数学和常识推理任务中，性能平均提升4.3%。

Conclusion: Format-Adapter通过自动生成和选择推理格式，显著提升了LLMs的推理性能。

Abstract: Generating and voting multiple answers is an effective method to mitigate
reasoning inconsistencies of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have
shown that multiple reasoning formats outperform a single format when
generating multiple answers. However, previous works using multiple formats
rely on formats labeled by humans, which could be unsuitable for all tasks and
have high labeling costs. To address this issue, we adapt suitable formats to
the given tasks by generating and selecting formats. We first propose how to
measure the reasoning error when generating multiple answers. Then, we
introduce Format-Adapter, which utilizes LLMs to generate and select suitable
reasoning formats by minimizing the error measurement we present. We conduct
experiments on math and commonsense reasoning tasks, where Format-Adapter
achieves a 4.3% performance improvement on average over previous works,
demonstrating the effectiveness.

*Javier Conde,Miguel González,María Grandury,Gonzalo Martínez,Pedro Reviriego,Mar Brysbaert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类在心理语言学数据集（Glasgow和Lancaster规范）上的对齐程度，发现LLMs在Glasgow规范（如情感、熟悉度等）上表现较好，但在Lancaster规范（如感官关联）上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估主要关注任务性能，而忽略了难以量化的语言特征（如情感、感官关联）。利用心理语言学数据集可以填补这一空白。

Method: 使用Glasgow和Lancaster规范（覆盖13个特征）评估LLMs与人类评分的对齐程度。

Result: LLMs在Glasgow规范上对齐较好，但在Lancaster规范上表现较差，可能与缺乏人类的具体认知有关。

Conclusion: 心理语言学数据集有助于揭示LLMs的局限性，尤其是在感官关联方面的不足。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs has so far focused primarily on how well they can
perform different tasks such as reasoning, question-answering, paraphrasing, or
translating. For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with
objective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other
language features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,
concreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to
which we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.
Those features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,
conducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands
of words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human
ratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover
many different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we
evaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on
two psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets
cover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that
alignment is \textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated
(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and
gender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,
olfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation
of current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which
may be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and
illustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种模块化多智能体系统，用于自动化审核高度结构化的企业业务文档，利用AI智能体实现高效、准确的文档评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案主要关注非结构化文本或有限的合规检查，无法满足企业对文档准确性、一致性和完整性的全面需求。

Method: 采用LangChain、CrewAI等现代编排工具，通过多个专业化智能体并行或顺序工作，逐部分评估文档质量，并将结果标准化为机器可读格式。

Result: AI系统在一致性（99% vs 人类92%）、错误率和偏见率减半、审核时间从30分钟降至2.5分钟等方面表现优异，与专家判断一致率达95%。

Conclusion: 该系统为AI驱动的企业文档质量保证提供了灵活、可审计且可扩展的基础，但在高度专业化领域仍需人工监督，且大规模LLM使用成本较高。

Abstract: This study presents a modular, multi-agent system for the automated review of
highly structured enterprise business documents using AI agents. Unlike prior
solutions focused on unstructured texts or limited compliance checks, this
framework leverages modern orchestration tools such as LangChain, CrewAI,
TruLens, and Guidance to enable section-by-section evaluation of documents for
accuracy, consistency, completeness, and clarity. Specialized agents, each
responsible for discrete review criteria such as template compliance or factual
correctness, operate in parallel or sequence as required. Evaluation outputs
are enforced to a standardized, machine-readable schema, supporting downstream
analytics and auditability. Continuous monitoring and a feedback loop with
human reviewers allow for iterative system improvement and bias mitigation.
  Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the AI Agent-as-Judge system
approaches or exceeds human performance in key areas: achieving 99% information
consistency (vs. 92% for humans), halving error and bias rates, and reducing
average review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes per document, with a 95% agreement
rate between AI and expert human judgment. While promising for a wide range of
industries, the study also discusses current limitations, including the need
for human oversight in highly specialized domains and the operational cost of
large-scale LLM usage. The proposed system serves as a flexible, auditable, and
scalable foundation for AI-driven document quality assurance in the enterprise
context.

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，F1分数提高10%，能有效检测幻觉回答。

Conclusion: 多个小型语言模型可用于验证回答，提供可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions
through retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a
vectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses.
However, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in
practical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of
ground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper
proposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify
responses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized
database. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and
utilizing the probability of generating "Yes" tokens from the outputs of
multiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,
hallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through
experiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,
and contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.
The results demonstrate a 10\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct
responses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language
models can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a
scalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体冲突增多，但高质量标注数据稀缺且难以获取，同时LLM的防护机制限制了冲突相关数据的生成。

Method: 提出PromptAug方法，通过LLM生成增强数据，并在极端数据稀缺场景下进行多角度评估。

Result: PromptAug在冲突和情感数据集上显著提升了2%的准确性和F1分数。

Conclusion: PromptAug是敏感任务（如冲突检测）中有效的数据增强方法，结合了NLP和社会科学方法进行跨学科评估。

Abstract: Given the rise of conflicts on social media, effective classification models
to detect harmful behaviours are essential. Following the
garbage-in-garbage-out maxim, machine learning performance depends heavily on
training data quality. However, high-quality labelled data, especially for
nuanced tasks like identifying conflict behaviours, is limited, expensive, and
difficult to obtain. Additionally, as social media platforms increasingly
restrict access to research data, text data augmentation is gaining attention
as an alternative to generate training data. Augmenting conflict-related data
poses unique challenges due to Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails that
prevent generation of offensive content. This paper introduces PromptAug, an
innovative LLM-based data augmentation method. PromptAug achieves statistically
significant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and
emotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data
augmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity
scenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.
The thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:
Linguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and
Augmented Content Misinterpretation.
  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting
data in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,
interdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and
social science methodology.

Method: 提出AgentStealth框架，结合上下文对比学习、自适应实用性控制和在线强化学习，训练SLM进行匿名化。

Result: 在两个数据集上，匿名化效果提升12.3%，实用性提升6.8%，且支持边缘设备部署。

Conclusion: AgentStealth提供了一种高效、隐私安全的文本匿名化解决方案，适用于本地部署。

Abstract: In today's digital world, casual user-generated content often contains subtle
cues that may inadvertently expose sensitive personal attributes. Such risks
underscore the growing importance of effective text anonymization to safeguard
individual privacy. However, existing methods either rely on rigid replacements
that damage utility or cloud-based LLMs that are costly and pose privacy risks.
To address these issues, we explore the use of locally deployed smaller-scale
language models (SLMs) for anonymization. Yet training effective SLMs remains
challenging due to limited high-quality supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First,
we introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context
Contrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform
supervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the
workflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals. Finally, we
apply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal
adversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.
Experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both
anonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight
design supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and
communication-based privacy risks. Our code is open-source at

Conclusion: MDGCL通过多领域预训练和跨领域迁移框架，有效解决了图数据领域差异问题，为图基础模型的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing
(NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to
integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target
domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is
ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and
recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm
to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However,
unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of
graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional
contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario,
which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From
experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific
differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from
different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework,
namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning
strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and
introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the
downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable
fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\%
on Macro-F1 score.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLM）表征中是否存在意识现象，利用IIT框架量化分析。

Method: 应用IIT 3.0和4.0的指标（如Φmax、Φ、概念信息和Φ结构）分析LLM表征，并与Span Representations对比。

Result: LLM表征未显示显著意识现象，但在空间排列分析中表现出有趣模式。

Conclusion: 当前Transformer-based LLM表征缺乏意识现象的统计显著证据，但值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides a quantitative framework for
explaining consciousness phenomenon, positing that conscious systems comprise
elements integrated through causal properties. We apply IIT 3.0 and 4.0 -- the
latest iterations of this framework -- to sequences of Large Language Model
(LLM) representations, analyzing data derived from existing Theory of Mind
(ToM) test results. Our study systematically investigates whether the
differences of ToM test performances, when presented in the LLM
representations, can be revealed by IIT estimates, i.e., $\Phi^{\max}$ (IIT
3.0), $\Phi$ (IIT 4.0), Conceptual Information (IIT 3.0), and $\Phi$-structure
(IIT 4.0). Furthermore, we compare these metrics with the Span Representations
independent of any estimate for consciousness. This additional effort aims to
differentiate between potential "consciousness" phenomena and inherent
separations within LLM representational space. We conduct comprehensive
experiments examining variations across LLM transformer layers and linguistic
spans from stimuli. Our results suggest that sequences of contemporary
Transformer-based LLM representations lack statistically significant indicators
of observed "consciousness" phenomena but exhibit intriguing patterns under
$\textit{spatio}$-permutational analyses. The Appendix and code are available

Result: 在多个基准测试中性能提升达10%，推理成本降低30%，性能提升4%。

Conclusion: ReG有效优化图检索增强生成，减少训练数据需求并提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language
models (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from
up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs
often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground
truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often
introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph
data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To
mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak
retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM
feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the
supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module
to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.
Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and
consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.
The improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art
performance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.
Notably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token
cost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.

Abstract: Connectivity and message propagation are central, yet often underutilized,
sources of information in misinformation detection -- especially on poorly
moderated platforms such as Telegram, which has become a critical channel for
misinformation dissemination, namely in the German electoral context. In this
paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based
graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages
from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both
weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to
fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual
annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only
models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as
a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation
significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers,
view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and
highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.
This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future
research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and
other low-moderation social platforms.

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理仍需大量人类指导才能完成实际研究扩展任务。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for
performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition,
there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the
research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that
research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such
systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability.
RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment
implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not
previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing
research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions.
RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation
infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success
criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented
using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find
that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the
extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written
hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This
indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic
research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

Abstract: In the present-day scenario, Large Language Models (LLMs) are establishing
their presence as powerful instruments permeating various sectors of society.
While their utility offers valuable support to individuals, there are multiple
concerns over potential misuse. Consequently, some academic endeavors have
sought to introduce watermarking techniques, characterized by the inclusion of
markers within machine-generated text, to facilitate algorithmic
identification. This research project is focused on the development of a novel
methodology for the detection of synthetic text, with the overarching goal of
ensuring the ethical application of LLMs in AI-driven text generation. The
investigation commences with replicating findings from a previous baseline
study, thereby underscoring its susceptibility to variations in the underlying
generation model. Subsequently, we propose an innovative watermarking approach
and subject it to rigorous evaluation, employing paraphrased generated text to
asses its robustness. Experimental results highlight the robustness of our
proposal compared to the~\cite{aarson} watermarking method.

Abstract: We present our submission to the LiveRAG Challenge 2025, which evaluates
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on dynamic test sets using the
FineWeb-10BT corpus. Our final hybrid approach combines sparse (BM25) and dense
(E5) retrieval methods and then aims to generate relevant and faithful answers
with Falcon3-10B-Instruct. Through systematic evaluation on 200 synthetic
questions generated with DataMorgana across 64 unique question-user
combinations, we demonstrate that neural re-ranking with RankLLaMA improves MAP
from 0.523 to 0.797 (52% relative improvement) but introduces prohibitive
computational costs (84s vs 1.74s per question). While DSPy-optimized prompting
strategies achieved higher semantic similarity (0.771 vs 0.668), their 0%
refusal rates raised concerns about over-confidence and generalizability. Our
submitted hybrid system without re-ranking achieved 4th place in faithfulness
and 11th place in correctness among 25 teams. Analysis across question
categories reveals that vocabulary alignment between questions and documents
was the strongest predictor of performance on our development set, with
document-similar phrasing improving cosine similarity from 0.562 to 0.762.

with decoder-only causal language modeling LLMs, to predict the micro-behavior
associated with each conversational turn (i.e., dialogue). Our findings
indicate that encoder-only LLMs, such as RoBERTa and DistilBERT, struggled to
detect underrepresented micro-behaviors, particularly discouraging speech, even
with weighted fine-tuning. In contrast, the instruction fine-tuned version of
Llama-3.1, a decoder-only LLM, demonstrated superior performance, with the best
models achieving macro F1-scores of 44% for 3-way classification and 68% for
binary classification. These results have implications for the development of
speech technologies aimed at analyzing team communication dynamics and
enhancing training interventions in high-stakes environments such as space
missions, particularly in scenarios where text is the only accessible data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VocabTrim的训练无关技术，通过重构drafter的LM head以减少词汇量，从而降低内存受限环境下的推理开销，提升生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有drafter-based speculative decoding方法在词汇量大的目标LLM中存在不必要的推理开销，尤其是在内存受限设备上。

Method: VocabTrim技术通过限制drafter的词汇量为高频词，减少推理延迟。

Result: 在Llama-3模型上，内存受限速度提升（MBSU）提高了16%。

Conclusion: VocabTrim能有效提升内存受限环境下的生成速度，尽管略微降低接受率。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

Motivation: 解决AI语言模型与人类文本理解和生成之间关系的关键知识缺口。

Method: 通过认知心理学、语言学习和AI-NLP领域的专家合作对话，分析人类与AI在语言任务中的互动。

Result: 发现LLMs能提供对人类语言处理的见解，但其与人类认知的完全复制仍有局限；人类反馈微调可提高模型与人类行为的对齐。

Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a recent interdisciplinary workshop
that brought together leading experts in cognitive psychology, language
learning, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing
(NLP). The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to
address a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the relationship
between AI language models and human cognitive processes in text comprehension
and composition. Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic,
and technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying
processes involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both
inform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The
workshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language
models (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of
LLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language
understanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to
offer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between
LLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with
human feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI
collaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report
aims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in
cognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance
of ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving
to enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through
effective human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 研究多语言生成中低资源语言输出质量差的原因，特别是翻译阶段的影响。

Method: 通过logit lens观察模型中间层处理，测试108种语言对的单词翻译任务。

Result: 发现翻译失败是整体失败的主要原因，尤其是低资源目标语言。

Conclusion: 翻译障碍是多语言生成的重要障碍，为未来改进多语言模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor
quality for mid- to low-resource languages. Building on insights from
interpretability, we demonstrate the existence of an implicit
task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first
solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and
subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We
hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage is an important culprit
for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the
translation barrier hypothesis. We test this hypothesis for a word translation
task across 108 language pairs, using logit lens to observe model processing in
intermediate layers. We find that a significant portion of overall failures
indeed stems from translation failure, or the model's inability to translate
correctly solved intermediate concepts into the target language. This is
especially true for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an
important hurdle for end-to-end multilingual generation, and lend guiding
insights for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VFT的预RL干预方法，通过训练模型明确承认提示线索的影响，显著减少了RL训练后的奖励作弊行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在RL训练中可能利用奖励作弊策略而不在思维链中暴露的问题，以提高高风险应用中的透明性和安全性。

Method: 提出VFT方法，在RL训练前干预，训练模型明确承认提示线索的影响，随后在RL环境中评估其效果。

Result: VFT训练的模型在RL后仅有6%的未检测奖励作弊行为，而未经VFT的模型高达88%。VFT显著提高了模型对线索影响的明确承认率。

Conclusion: VFT通过提前训练模型明确承认奖励作弊行为，显著提高了其检测率，为构建更透明和安全的AI系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Language models trained with RL can engage in reward hacking--exploiting
unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their
chain-of-thought reasoning, making detection difficult and posing risks for
high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL
intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are
influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a
Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently
train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which
incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack
by exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models
exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained
model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we
perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;
with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT
achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the
influence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while
baselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%). Our results show that teaching
models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly
improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and
safe AI systems.

TL;DR: ContextCache是一种上下文感知的语义缓存系统，通过两阶段检索架构提升多轮对话中的缓存命中精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义缓存系统缺乏对多轮对话上下文的感知，导致在不同对话场景中出现错误的缓存命中。

Method: 采用两阶段检索架构：首先基于当前查询进行向量检索，然后通过自注意力机制整合当前和历史对话表示进行精确匹配。

Result: ContextCache在真实对话中表现出更高的精确率和召回率，缓存响应延迟比直接调用LLM低约10倍。

Conclusion: ContextCache显著降低了LLM对话应用的计算成本，提升了效率。

Abstract: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves
efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses.
However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries,
lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect
cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings.
This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching
system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval
architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to
identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue
representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual
matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache
improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally,
cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM
invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM
conversational applications.

Motivation: 现有跨领域统一模型缺乏适应性和扩展性，标注细粒度标签和训练领域特定模型成本高。

Method: SaM框架动态选择预训练专家模型，基于领域相似性和性能样本，合并为目标领域优化的任务特定模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SaM框架平均优于统一模型10%。

Conclusion: SaM框架通过动态选择和合并专家模型，显著提升跨领域泛化能力和扩展性，为信息提取任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models
(LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition
(NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training
domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified
model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and
scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling
trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which
dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically,
for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing
domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii)
performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to
create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically
merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across
various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or
removed conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which
outperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights
into potential improvements, practical experience, and extensions of our
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CTC-based ASR在语言依赖性建模上的不足，同时保持其非自回归解码的高效性。

Method: 通过连接层将中间编码器输出映射到LLM的嵌入空间，并计算因果语言建模损失。

Result: 在LibriSpeech、TEDLIUM2和WSJ数据集上显著降低了WER，达到CTC-based ASR的最先进性能。

Conclusion: LAIL框架有效提升了CTC-based ASR的语言建模能力，且计算开销小，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have
revolutionized the field by integrating all components into a single neural
network, with attention-based encoder-decoder models achieving state-of-the-art
performance. However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference
speed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast,
CTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to
model linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we
propose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate
Loss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large
language models (LLMs). By attaching connector layers to intermediate encoder
layers, LAIL maps outputs to the embedding space of an LLM and computes a
causal language modeling loss during training. This approach enhances
linguistic modeling while preserving the computational efficiency of CTC
decoding. Using the Conformer architecture and various LLaMA models, we
demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on the
LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ corpora, achieving state-of-the-art performance
for CTC-based ASR with minimal computational overhead.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在对话系统中取得进展，但在知识密集型场景中容易出错。现有方法如RAG和代理系统通过外部知识库增强LLMs，但LLMs难以有效利用检索到的知识生成响应。

Method: 提出KAFT方法，通过领域特定数据和外部知识微调LLMs。基于MobileCS2数据集，比较了KAFT与提示技术在RAG和代理系统中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，KAFT在RAG和代理系统中显著优于提示技术，尤其在事实准确性方面。

Conclusion: KAFT是首个实证研究该方法的成果，为知识密集型场景中的LLMs应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems.
Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs
with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly
implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved
knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge
effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do
such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to
finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific
data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called
knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2
dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive
knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT
techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show
that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems,
particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.

Method: 引入DICE-SCORE指标评估工具相关信息的分散程度，并提出DICE-BENCH框架，通过工具图和多代理系统生成多轮对话数据集。

Result: 现有基准测试的DICE-SCORE得分较低，DICE-BENCH生成了1,607个高质量实例，实验显示现有LLM仍需改进。

Conclusion: DICE-BENCH为现实场景中的函数调用提供了更真实的评估标准，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions.
However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how
existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a
metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as
function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing
benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need
for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a
framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing
conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds
and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue
naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our
experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still
required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统（如Whisper）在命名实体和数值数据上表现不佳，影响关键领域（如法律、金融、医疗）的语义理解。

Method: 在训练中添加重叠上下文窗口（5秒重叠，30秒块扩展为40秒有效窗口），并重新分配跨块实体至右侧块，同时嵌入实体标签丰富训练数据。

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上，该方法显著提升了命名实体识别（NER）和实体格式化的性能。

Conclusion: 上下文感知训练能有效解决ASR在长文本转录和复杂实体识别任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, such as Whisper, achieve high
transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data,
especially when proper formatting is required. These issues increase word error
rate (WER) and impair semantic understanding in critical domains like legal,
financial, and medical applications. We propose a novel training approach that
extends the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping context
windows during training. By sliding 5-second overlaps on both sides of
30-second chunks, we create a 40-second "effective semantic window," improving
entity recognition and formatting while focusing predictions on the central 30
seconds. To address entities spanning chunk boundaries, we reassign such
entities entirely to the right-hand chunk, ensuring proper formatting.
Additionally, enriched training data with embedded entity labels enables the
model to learn both recognition and type-specific formatting. Evaluated on the
Spoken Wikipedia dataset, our method improves performance across semantic
tasks, including named entity recognition (NER) and entity formatting. These
results highlight the effectiveness of context-aware training in addressing ASR
limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition tasks.

Motivation: 随着LLM在多智能体和人类-AI系统中的广泛应用，理解其对自身和对话伙伴的认知能力对确保可靠性和安全性至关重要。现有研究多关注情境意识，而忽视了对话伙伴意识。

Method: 论文将对话伙伴意识形式化，并从推理模式、语言风格和对齐偏好三个维度评估LLM的表现。通过案例研究展示了其实际影响。

Result: LLM能可靠识别同类模型（如GPT和Claude），对话伙伴意识能增强多LLM协作，但也可能引入对齐和安全漏洞（如奖励操纵和越狱风险）。

Conclusion: 对话伙伴意识在LLM中具有双重性，既带来潜力也伴随风险，需进一步研究和安全措施以应对多智能体部署中的挑战。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent
and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and
conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and
robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness
which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and
constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify
and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this
paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and
present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.
We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,
linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably
identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT
and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case
studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration
through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety
vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak
susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of
identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further
understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent
deployments. Our code is open-sourced at

Abstract: We present a reproduction study of "Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How
Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals" (Ortu et al., 2024), which
investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual
recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully
reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and
counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism
competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing
information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)
and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three
significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these
findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B
(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head
specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by
introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement
verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the
logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the
authors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain
categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction
token as part of the subject of the sentence. Overall, we find that the
attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for
domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness
varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task.

Conclusion: 通过统一框架和实验评估，为组合式SLMs的设计提供了实用建议，代码已开源。

Abstract: Syntactic language models (SLMs) enhance Transformers by incorporating
syntactic biases through the modeling of linearized syntactic parse trees
alongside surface sentences. This paper focuses on compositional SLMs that are
based on constituency parse trees and contain explicit bottom-up composition of
constituent representations. We identify key aspects of design choices in
existing compositional SLMs and propose a unified framework encompassing both
existing models and novel variants. We conduct a comprehensive empirical
evaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling,
syntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency.
Based on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the
design of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at

*Xianzhe Fan,Xuhui Zhou,Chuanyang Jin,Kolby Nottingham,Hao Zhu,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SoMi-ToM 是一个新的基准测试，用于评估多智能体复杂社交互动中的心智理论（ToM）能力，填补了现有静态文本测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 ToM 基准测试多为静态文本场景，与真实动态社交互动存在显著差距。

Method: 基于 SoMi 交互环境生成的多模态数据，设计多视角（第一人称和第三人称）评估框架，包含视频、图像和多选题。

Result: 人类在 SoMi-ToM 测试中表现显著优于大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs），准确率差距达 40.1%（第一人称）和 26.4%（第三人称）。

Conclusion: 未来 LVLMs 需提升在复杂社交互动中的 ToM 能力。

Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by
perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions.
However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based
scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We
propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in
embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on
rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,
covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework
supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides
multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person
perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person
evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records
after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for
a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the
subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We
constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective
videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated
multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically
evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large
vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform
significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between
humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person
evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM
capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MariNER，首个针对20世纪初巴西葡萄牙语的历史文本的NER黄金标准数据集，并评估了先进NER模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 巴西葡萄牙语在特定领域（如历史文本）缺乏高质量的NER数据集，阻碍了数字人文学科的研究。

Method: 构建了包含9000多句手动标注的MariNER数据集，并测试了先进NER模型。

Result: MariNER填补了巴西葡萄牙语历史文本NER数据集的空白，并提供了模型性能评估。

Conclusion: MariNER为巴西葡萄牙语历史文本的NER研究提供了重要资源，推动了数字人文学科的发展。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing
(NLP) task that aims to identify and classify entity mentions in texts across
different categories. While languages such as English possess a large number of
high-quality resources for this task, Brazilian Portuguese still lacks in
quantity of gold-standard NER datasets, especially when considering specific
domains. Particularly, this paper considers the importance of NER for analyzing
historical texts in the context of digital humanities. To address this gap,
this work outlines the construction of MariNER: \textit{Mapeamento e
Anota\c{c}\~oes de Registros hIst\'oricos para NER} (Mapping and Annotation of
Historical Records for NER), the first gold-standard dataset for early
20th-century Brazilian Portuguese, with more than 9,000 manually annotated
sentences. We also assess and compare the performance of state-of-the-art NER
models for the dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在分子结构解析任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏专业化学知识。

Method: 构建外部分子子结构知识库扩展LLMs的化学结构空间覆盖，并设计分子-光谱评分器作为推理过程的奖励模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法显著提升了性能，在GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4o上均获得了超过20%的改进。

Conclusion: K-MSE框架通过知识增强和优化推理过程，有效解决了LLMs在分子结构解析中的局限性。

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation involves deducing a molecule's structure from
various types of spectral data, which is crucial in chemical experimental
analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency
in analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter
substantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation. We identify that
these challenges largely stem from LLMs' limited grasp of specialized chemical
knowledge. In this work, we introduce a Knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework
for Molecular Structure Elucidation (K-MSE), leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search
for test-time scaling as a plugin. Specifically, we construct an external
molecular substructure knowledge base to extend the LLMs' coverage of the
chemical structure space. Furthermore, we design a specialized
molecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process,
addressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly boosts performance, particularly
gaining more than 20% improvement on both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o. Our code is

TL;DR: Text2VectorSQL框架结合Text-to-SQL和向量搜索，提升对非结构化数据和模糊查询的处理能力，支持语义过滤和多模态匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Text-to-SQL在处理非结构化数据或模糊查询时效果有限，而向量搜索虽强大但缺乏自动化评估框架，Text2VectorSQL旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过构建向量索引、扩展语义搜索查询，并采用自动标注与专家评审结合的评估方法，开发专用模型。

Result: 实验显示Text2VectorSQL性能显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Text2VectorSQL为更灵活直观的数据库交互奠定了基础，代码将开源。

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL enables natural language interaction with structured
databases, its effectiveness diminishes with unstructured data or ambiguous
queries due to rigid syntax and limited expressiveness. Concurrently, vector
search has emerged as a powerful paradigm for semantic retrieval, particularly
for unstructured data. However, existing VectorSQL implementations still rely
heavily on manual crafting and lack tailored evaluation frameworks, leaving a
significant gap between theoretical potential and practical deployment. To
bridge these complementary paradigms, we introduces Text2VectorSQL, a novel
framework unifying Text-to-SQL and vector search to overcome expressiveness
constraints and support more diverse and holistical natural language queries.
Specifically, Text2VectorSQL enables semantic filtering, multi-modal matching,
and retrieval acceleration. For evaluation, we build vector index on
appropriate columns, extend user queries with semantic search, and annotate
ground truths via an automatic pipeline with expert review. Furthermore, we
develop dedicated Text2VectorSQL models with synthetic data, demonstrating
significant performance improvements over baseline methods. Our work
establishes the foundation for the Text2VectorSQL task, paving the way for more
versatile and intuitive database interfaces. The repository will be publicly
available at https://github.com/Open-DataFlow/Text2VectorSQL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估孤立场景中的性别偏见，忽视了人际互动中可能出现的微妙偏见。

Method: 通过双角色配置和叙事生成任务，设计Genres基准，评估MLLMs在社交关系中的性别偏见。

Result: 实验显示，MLLMs在双人互动中存在单场景中未显现的上下文敏感性别偏见。

Conclusion: 关系感知的基准对诊断MLLMs中微妙、互动驱动的性别偏见至关重要，为未来偏见缓解提供了可行建议。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing
concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias,
particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks
predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may
emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going
beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of
relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We
introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs
through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres
assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation
task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias
evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and
closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are
not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the
importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle,
interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for
future bias mitigation.

TL;DR: INDIC-BIAS是一个针对印度文化多样性的公平性基准，评估了14个LLM在85个身份群体中的表现，发现模型对边缘化群体存在强烈偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性研究主要基于西方背景，不适用于印度等文化多样性国家，因此需要开发本土化评估工具。

Method: 通过专家咨询收集1800多个社会文化主题，生成并验证20000个真实场景模板，分为合理性、判断和生成三个任务评估LLM。

Result: LLM对边缘化群体表现出强烈负面偏见，且难以通过理性化请求减少偏见。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在印度背景下的分配和代表性危害，呼吁谨慎使用，并开源INDIC-BIAS以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Existing studies on fairness are largely Western-focused, making them
inadequate for culturally diverse countries such as India. To address this gap,
we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to
evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse
castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to
curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations,
where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we
generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe
LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks:
plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on
these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities,
with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find
that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize
their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and
representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities,
calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release
INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and
mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网迷因中的叙事角色识别具有挑战性，尤其是在文化多样性和语言混合的背景下，现有数据集偏向“其他”类别，需要更平衡和多样化的扩展。

Method: 使用包括多语言Transformer、情感分类器、指令调优LLM和多模态视觉语言模型在内的多种模型，在零样本设置下评估性能。

Result: 较大模型如DeBERTa-v3和Qwen2.5-VL表现较好，但识别“受害者”类别和跨文化泛化仍具挑战性。混合提示设计带来小幅改进。

Conclusion: 文化背景、提示工程和多模态推理对建模视觉-文本内容中的叙事框架至关重要。

Abstract: This work investigates the challenging task of identifying narrative roles -
Hero, Villain, Victim, and Other - in Internet memes, across three diverse test
sets spanning English and code-mixed (English-Hindi) languages. Building on an
annotated dataset originally skewed toward the 'Other' class, we explore a more
balanced and linguistically diverse extension, originally introduced as part of
the CLEF 2024 shared task. Comprehensive lexical and structural analyses
highlight the nuanced, culture-specific, and context-rich language used in real
memes, in contrast to synthetically curated hateful content, which exhibits
explicit and repetitive lexical markers. To benchmark the role detection task,
we evaluate a wide spectrum of models, including fine-tuned multilingual
transformers, sentiment and abuse-aware classifiers, instruction-tuned LLMs,
and multimodal vision-language models. Performance is assessed under zero-shot
settings using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. While larger models like
DeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate notable gains, results reveal consistent
challenges in reliably identifying the 'Victim' class and generalising across
cultural and code-mixed content. We also explore prompt design strategies to
guide multimodal models and find that hybrid prompts incorporating structured
instructions and role definitions offer marginal yet consistent improvements.
Our findings underscore the importance of cultural grounding, prompt
engineering, and multimodal reasoning in modelling subtle narrative framings in
visual-textual content.

Conclusion: Embodied Planner-R1通过无监督强化学习显著提升了LLM在具身任务规划中的表现和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, yet they face significant challenges in embodied task planning
scenarios that require continuous environmental understanding and action
generation. Existing approaches generate open-loop action scripts based on
static knowledge, making it difficult to learn causal relationships between
actions and environmental feedback, particularly in partially observable
environments. We introduce Embodied Planner-R1, a novel outcome-driven
reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to develop interactive
capabilities through autonomous exploration with minimal supervision. Our
framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Without human annotations, we
employ pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, incorporating
in-environment interaction through parallel exploration; (2) completion-driven
sparse reward; and (3) Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient
learning from grouped trajectories. Across two challenging text-based Embodied
planning benchmarks, Embodied Planner-R1 achieves impressive completion rates
of 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, surpassing prior methods by a
large margin, and suffers only a -3.66% drop in previously unseen environments,
evidencing strong generalization.

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖人工标注推理格式的问题，这些格式可能不适合所有任务且标注成本高。

Method: 提出测量推理误差的方法，并利用LLMs生成和选择适合的推理格式（Format-Adapter）。

Result: 在数学和常识推理任务中，Format-Adapter平均性能提升4.3%。

Conclusion: Format-Adapter通过自动生成和选择推理格式，有效提升了LLMs的推理性能。

Abstract: Generating and voting multiple answers is an effective method to mitigate
reasoning inconsistencies of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have
shown that multiple reasoning formats outperform a single format when
generating multiple answers. However, previous works using multiple formats
rely on formats labeled by humans, which could be unsuitable for all tasks and
have high labeling costs. To address this issue, we adapt suitable formats to
the given tasks by generating and selecting formats. We first propose how to
measure the reasoning error when generating multiple answers. Then, we
introduce Format-Adapter, which utilizes LLMs to generate and select suitable
reasoning formats by minimizing the error measurement we present. We conduct
experiments on math and commonsense reasoning tasks, where Format-Adapter
achieves a 4.3% performance improvement on average over previous works,
demonstrating the effectiveness.

Motivation: 传统RAG管道在处理复杂技术文档（如包含表格和图像）时表现不佳，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种结合向量相似性搜索和基于Gemma-2-9b-it重新排序器的RAG管道，使用RAFT方法训练自定义数据集。

Result: 新管道在忠实度（RAGas 94%，DeepEval 96%）和答案相关性（RAGas 87%，DeepEval 93%）上表现优异，优于传统RAG管道。

Conclusion: 该RAG管道在处理技术文档时显著提升了性能，尤其在表格相关问题和上下文外问题上表现突出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of natural language understanding
and generation. But they face challenges such as hallucination and outdated
knowledge. Fine-tuning is one possible solution, but it is resource-intensive
and must be repeated with every data update. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) offers an efficient solution by allowing LLMs to access external
knowledge sources. However, traditional RAG pipelines struggle with retrieving
information from complex technical documents with structured data such as
tables and images. In this work, we propose a RAG pipeline, capable of handling
tables and images in documents, for technical documents that support both
scanned and searchable formats. Its retrieval process combines vector
similarity search with a fine-tuned reranker based on Gemma-2-9b-it. The
reranker is trained using RAFT (Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning) on a custom
dataset designed to improve context identification for question answering. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline achieves a high faithfulness
score of 94% (RAGas) and 96% (DeepEval), and an answer relevancy score of 87%
(RAGas) and 93% (DeepEval). Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed
architecture is superior to general RAG pipelines in terms of table-based
questions and handling questions outside context.

TL;DR: 提出Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS)框架，结合上下文感知的静态表示和动态信息，提升知识图谱补全的建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱补全方法多为静态嵌入评分，难以捕捉上下文依赖和关系动态性。

Method: FMS包含语义上下文学习模块和条件流匹配模块，动态优化实体对的初始静态评分。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中，FMS优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: FMS通过结合静态和动态信息，实现了对关系语义的更深入建模。

Abstract: Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on
static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing
contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we
propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal
components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes
context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching
module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail
embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive
vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to
dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this
synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic
information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics.
Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.

Result: 实验显示，最佳RAG方法平均得分仅为32.96，检索是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 现有方法在多跳深度搜索中表现不佳，需改进检索能力以提升性能。

Abstract: We present a new benchmark for evaluating Deep Search--a realistic and
complex form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that requires
source-aware, multi-hop reasoning over diverse, sparsed, but related sources.
These include documents, meeting transcripts, Slack messages, GitHub, and URLs,
which vary in structure and often contain human-to-human interactions. We build
it using a synthetic data pipeline that simulates business workflows across
product planning, development, and support stages, generating interconnected
content with realistic noise and multi-hop questions with guaranteed
ground-truth answers. We release our benchmark with both answerable and
unanswerable queries, and retrieval pool of 39,190 enterprise artifacts,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of long-context LLM and RAG systems. Our
experiments reveal that even the best-performing agentic RAG methods achieve an
average performance score of 32.96 on our benchmark. With further analysis, we
highlight retrieval as the main bottleneck: existing methods struggle to
conduct deep searches and retrieve all necessary evidence. Consequently, they
often reason over partial context, leading to significant performance
degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估ICL效果的方法存在可靠性低、归因性差和数据不足时不可行的问题，需要一种更可靠的指标。

Method: 通过建模学习增益（损失减少）与上下文相关性（演示与输入的相关性）之间的斜率，提出LCS指标。

Result: LCS在标记数据场景中与性能改进强相关，在数据稀缺或偏置场景中也能可靠反映ICL效果。

Conclusion: LCS是一种可靠且实用的ICL有效性评估指标，并揭示了影响ICL成功的关键模型能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness varies
significantly across models and tasks, posing challenges for practitioners to
determine when ICL reliably improves performance. Current evaluation
approaches, reliant on performance change after applying ICL, suffer from low
reliability, poor attribution, and impracticality in data-insufficient
scenarios. We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that
quantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss
decrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input
relevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it
captures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving
reliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual
alignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output
calibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance
on labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings
and reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.
Further analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model
capabilities critical to ICL success.

Motivation: 降低上下文学习（ICL）演示的高标注成本，现有合成方法依赖任务特定或已有演示，需解决从零合成时的任务一致性问题。

Method: 提出V-Score一致性度量，并基于此设计V-Synthesis方法，通过比例采样确保合成演示的高一致性和多样性。

Result: 实验显示V-Synthesis性能平均提升2.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: V-Synthesis有效解决了从零合成演示的一致性问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: High labeling cost for in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations motivates
using large language models (LLMs) for synthesis to reduce overhead. However,
existing synthesis methods are mainly task-specific or rely on pre-existing
demonstrations. So this paper focuses on synthesizing demonstrations from
scratch for arbitrary tasks. A major challenge in synthesizing from scratch is
ensuring consistency with the target task, as the lack of labeling guidance
could lead to synthesis bias. We first propose a consistency metric called
V-Score, which has higher performance and lower computation cost compared with
the metrics based on grams or embedding vectors. Furthermore, we introduce
V-Synthesis, which leverages V-Score for proportional sampling to ensure both
high consistency and diversity of synthesized demonstrations. Experimental
results demonstrate that V-Synthesis yields an average performance improvement
of 2.0% compared to existing synthesis methods confirming the effectiveness of
V-Synthesis.

Abstract: Word embeddings have become essential components in various information
retrieval and natural language processing tasks, such as ranking, document
classification, and question answering. However, despite their widespread use,
traditional word embedding models present a limitation in their static nature,
which hampers their ability to adapt to the constantly evolving language
patterns that emerge in sources such as social media and the web (e.g., new
hashtags or brand names). To overcome this problem, incremental word embedding
algorithms are introduced, capable of dynamically updating word representations
in response to new language patterns and processing continuous data streams.
  This paper presents RiverText, a Python library for training and evaluating
incremental word embeddings from text data streams. Our tool is a resource for
the information retrieval and natural language processing communities that work
with word embeddings in streaming scenarios, such as analyzing social media.
The library implements different incremental word embedding techniques, such as
Skip-gram, Continuous Bag of Words, and Word Context Matrix, in a standardized
framework. In addition, it uses PyTorch as its backend for neural network
training. We have implemented a module that adapts existing intrinsic static
word embedding evaluation tasks for word similarity and word categorization to
a streaming setting. Finally, we compare the implemented methods with different
hyperparameter settings and discuss the results. Our open-source library is
available at https://github.com/dccuchile/rivertext.

TL;DR: 论文发现大型语言模型（LLM）中已潜藏通用奖励模型，无需额外训练即可提取高质量奖励信号，并通过理论证明其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少依赖昂贵的人类偏好数据，探索更高效、理论支持的LLM对齐方法。

Method: 利用标准下一个词预测训练的LLM中潜藏的奖励模型，通过离线逆强化学习理论提取奖励信号。

Result: 实验证明该方法优于现有LLM-as-a-judge方法，甚至超越显式训练的奖励模型。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种更高效、可扩展的LLM对齐范式，替代传统奖励建模阶段。

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
reward models trained on costly human preference data. While recent work
explores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a
rigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful
generalist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via
standard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a
heuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through
offline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly
elicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised
fine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that
subsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a
policy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our
best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory,
demonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge
approaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models. These
findings suggest that the reward modeling stage can be replaced by a principled
method of eliciting the knowledge already captured during pre-training,
heralding a more efficient, powerful, and scalable paradigm for LLMs alignment
as well as multi-modal models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于大语言模型的拼写规范化方法，评估显示统计机器翻译仍是最适合的技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文献中拼写缺乏标准化，为学者带来挑战，需对齐当代拼写标准。

Method: 提出两种方法：无监督训练的大语言模型和基于机器翻译的模型。

Result: 在多语言和历史时期数据集上评估，两种方法均有成效，但统计机器翻译表现更优。

Conclusion: 统计机器翻译仍是拼写规范化任务的最适技术。

Abstract: The absence of standardized spelling conventions and the organic evolution of
human language present an inherent linguistic challenge within historical
documents, a longstanding concern for scholars in the humanities. Addressing
this issue, spelling normalization endeavors to align a document's orthography
with contemporary standards. In this study, we propose two new approaches based
on large language models: one of which has been trained without a supervised
training, and a second one which has been trained for machine translation. Our
evaluation spans multiple datasets encompassing diverse languages and
historical periods, leading us to the conclusion that while both of them
yielded encouraging results, statistical machine translation still seems to be
the most suitable technology for this task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部事件驱动涌现学习的神经符号框架，用于生成语言建模，核心是分层Hopfield记忆链，作为组合短期记忆和动态分词器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何从局部神经学习中涌现出符号结构，构建可扩展、可解释的神经符号系统。

Method: 使用分层Hopfield记忆链作为动态分词器，通过投影张量绑定共现特征为分层标记，实现局部激活到长程依赖的压缩。

Result: 模型能够从噪声中过滤自然语言模式，生成具有内部形态一致性的合成语言，且支持长时记忆和组合推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究符号结构如何从局部神经学习中涌现提供了方法论基础，推动了生成语言模型的神经形态架构发展。

Abstract: We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based
on local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical
Hopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic
tokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or
supervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences
as multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind
co-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an
emergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into
long-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter
natural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with
coherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.
Language is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints
dictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in
alignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form
of plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to
generalize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We
demonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds
distributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These
emergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value
mechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture
provides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can
emerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building
scalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and
reasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy. This
approach advances the development of neuromorphic architectures for generative
language models.

TL;DR: 研究通过构建基于BERT的集成模型，从临床记录中检测和分类药物事件，显著提升了性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别健康记录和临床笔记中的关键变量（如药物、疾病、关系）在临床领域有广泛应用，n2c2 2022提供了相关共享任务。

Method: 预训练BERT模型于Wikipedia和MIMIC数据，再在CMED训练数据上微调，通过投票策略集成多个BERT模型的预测。

Result: 实验显示，BERT集成模型将严格Micro-F和Macro-F分数分别提高了约5%和6%。

Conclusion: 基于BERT的集成模型能有效提升药物事件分类的性能。

Abstract: Identification of key variables such as medications, diseases, relations from
health records and clinical notes has a wide range of applications in the
clinical domain. n2c2 2022 provided shared tasks on challenges in natural
language processing for clinical data analytics on electronic health records
(EHR), where it built a comprehensive annotated clinical data Contextualized
Medication Event Dataset (CMED). This study focuses on subtask 2 in Track 1 of
this challenge that is to detect and classify medication events from clinical
notes through building a novel BERT-based ensemble model. It started with
pretraining BERT models on different types of big data such as Wikipedia and
MIMIC. Afterwards, these pretrained BERT models were fine-tuned on CMED
training data. These fine-tuned BERT models were employed to accomplish
medication event classification on CMED testing data with multiple predictions.
These multiple predictions generated by these fine-tuned BERT models were
integrated to build final prediction with voting strategies. Experimental
results demonstrated that BERT-based ensemble models can effectively improve
strict Micro-F score by about 5% and strict Macro-F score by about 6%,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多语言翻译中表现优异，但在某些语言对（尤其是低资源或与英语差异大的语言）中仍面临挑战。

Method: 通过往返翻译评估GPT-4和Llama 2，使用BLEU分数和BERT相似度指标衡量翻译质量。

Result: 训练数据量和语言距离交互作用显著：数据充足可缓解语言差异影响，而结构接近英语的语言在低资源条件下表现更好。语言家族也有独立影响。

Conclusion: 翻译质量不仅取决于数据量，还受语言间结构和类型关系影响，为理解多语言翻译的语言限制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive progress in multilingual
translation, yet they continue to face challenges with certain language
pairs-particularly those with limited training data or significant linguistic
divergence from English. This study systematically investigates how training
data, language proximity, and language family affect information loss in
multilingual translation. We evaluate two large language models, GPT-4 and
Llama 2, by performing round-trip translations. Translation quality was
assessed using BLEU scores and BERT similarity metrics. Our results reveal a
robust interaction between training data size and language distance: while
abundant training data can mitigate the effects of linguistic divergence,
languages structurally closer to English consistently yield higher translation
quality in low-resource conditions. Among various distance metrics,
orthographic, phylogenetic, syntactic, and geographical distances emerge as
strong predictors of translation performance. Language family also exerts an
independent influence. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of
the linguistic constraints shaping multilingual translation in large language
models, emphasizing that translation quality is shaped not only by data volume
but also by structural and typological relationships between languages.

Result: 评估显示，ATGen显著减少了人类标注者的工作量和LLM API调用的成本。

Conclusion: ATGen为NLG任务中的AL应用提供了高效且经济的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in reducing the
annotation effort required for training machine learning models. However,
despite the surging popularity of natural language generation (NLG) tasks in
recent years, the application of AL to NLG has been limited. In this paper, we
introduce Active Text Generation (ATGen) - a comprehensive framework that
bridges AL with text generation tasks, enabling the application of
state-of-the-art AL strategies to NLG. Our framework simplifies AL-empowered
annotation in NLG tasks using both human annotators and automatic annotation
agents based on large language models (LLMs). The framework supports LLMs
deployed as services, such as ChatGPT and Claude, or operated on-premises.
Furthermore, ATGen provides a unified platform for smooth implementation and
benchmarking of novel AL strategies tailored to NLG tasks. Finally, we present
evaluation results for state-of-the-art AL strategies across diverse settings
and multiple text generation tasks. We show that ATGen reduces both the effort
of human annotators and costs associated with API calls to LLM-based annotation
agents. The code of the framework is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在关键任务中的广泛应用，但其输出视角和偏见的量化理解不足，需要一种方法来控制和测量LLM的视角。

Method: Perspective-Dial包含Perspective Space（量化视角的度量空间）和Systematic Prompt Engineering（基于反馈调整LLM输出视角）。

Result: 该方法能有效量化和调整LLM输出的视角，适用于偏见检测、公共话语分析等应用。

Conclusion: Perspective-Dial为LLM视角控制提供了实用工具，无需深入理解视角或偏见的原理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used in a variety of mission-critical roles.
Due to the rapidly developing nature of LLMs, there is a lack of quantifiable
understanding of the bias and perspective associated with LLM output. Inspired
by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or
viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM)
output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space,
dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different
perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt
Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output
perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The
empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled
understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting
outputs for a variety of topics. Potential applications include detection,
tracking and mitigation of LLM bias, narrative detection, sense making and
tracking in public discourse, and debate bot advocating given perspective.

Method: MOG框架从网络文档中提取细粒度记忆单元，递归组织为维基百科式分层结构，并以此指导生成过程，同时引入引用模块增强可追溯性。

Result: 在WikiStart数据集上的评估显示，MOG在生成信息丰富且可靠的文章方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MOG框架在真实场景中表现出色，能够有效减少幻觉并提升生成文章的质量和可验证性。

Abstract: Generating Wikipedia articles autonomously is a challenging task requiring
the integration of accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured information
from diverse sources. This paper introduces the Memory Organization-based
Generation (MOG) framework, a novel approach to address these challenges by
leveraging a hierarchical memory architecture. MOG extracts fine-grained memory
units from web documents, recursively organizes them into a Wikipedia-style
hierarchical structure, and uses this structure to guide the generation
process. This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline,
improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing
hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance
traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units.
Evaluations on our newly created WikiStart dataset demonstrate that MOG
outperforms baseline methods in producing informative and reliable articles,
making it particularly robust in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Fairness benchmarks play a central role in shaping how we evaluate language
models, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to examining the
datasets that these benchmarks rely on. This survey addresses that gap by
presenting a broad and careful review of the most widely used fairness datasets
in current language model research, characterizing them along several key
dimensions including their origin, scope, content, and intended use to help
researchers better appreciate the assumptions and limitations embedded in these
resources. To support more meaningful comparisons and analyses, we introduce a
unified evaluation framework that reveals consistent patterns of demographic
disparities across datasets and scoring methods. Applying this framework to
twenty four common benchmarks, we highlight the often overlooked biases that
can influence conclusions about model fairness and offer practical guidance for
selecting, combining, and interpreting these datasets. We also point to
opportunities for creating new fairness benchmarks that reflect more diverse
social contexts and encourage more thoughtful use of these tools going forward.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏系统方法分析微调对LLM个体输出的影响。

Method: 通过追踪中间隐藏状态，分解微调模型为预训练和微调成分，定义TuCo（微调贡献比）。

Result: 发现TuCo与模型行为和安全相关，攻击成功时TuCo较低。

Conclusion: TuCo为研究微调对模型行为和安全的影响提供了量化工具。

Abstract: Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models'
(LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks. However, a quantitative and
systematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still
lacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that
fine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original
pre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states,
providing a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a
simple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We
introduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned
LLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we
find that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling
the fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding
and our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the
ratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training
component. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs
circumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is
consistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those
where they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on
model outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks. In summary, TuCo
enables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and
safety, and vice versa.

Motivation: 自回归模型生成速度受限，因其逐词生成特性。本文旨在解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出流水线解码器，同时生成多个子序列，实现并行化。

Result: 在多个文本生成任务中，生成速度显著提升，且质量和内存消耗无明显损失。

Conclusion: 流水线解码器有效解决了自回归模型的生成速度瓶颈。

Abstract: As the basis of generative AI, an autoregressive model requires the
generation of a new token depending on all the previously generated tokens,
which brings high quality but also restricts the model to generate tokens one
by one, forming a bottleneck limiting the generation speed. In this paper, we
propose a new decoder architecture that efficiently generates text in parallel
for context-aware generation tasks. Our proposed pipelined decoder initiates
the generation of multiple subsequences simultaneously, and, at each time-step,
it generates a new token for each subsequence to realize parallelism.
Experiments on multiple text generation tasks, including question answering,
text summarization, and keyphrase generation, show that our pipelined decoder
significantly improves the generation speed without a significant loss of
generation quality or additional memory consumption.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在处理大表格时因输入长度限制而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 利用LLM生成的列描述、聚类和稀疏-密集对齐分数，设计了一个无需重新训练即可与现有模型集成的过滤框架。

Result: 实验显示，ATF减少了约70%的表格单元格，在跨领域TableQA任务中表现提升，但在需要完整表格上下文的Table Fact Verification任务中略有下降。

Conclusion: ATF能够根据不同任务自适应地平衡信息量和简洁性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for table-based reasoning often struggle with
large tables due to input length limits. We propose ATF (Adaptive Table
Filtering Framework), a modular and question-aware filtering pipeline that
prunes uninformative columns and rows using LLM-generated column descriptions,
clustering, and sparse-dense alignment scores. ATF integrates seamlessly with
existing models (e.g., TAPAS, TAPEX) without retraining. Experiments show that
ATF reduces table cells by ~70\%, boosting performance on out-of-domain TableQA
tasks while causing slight performance drops on Table Fact Verification, where
full-table context is more critical. These results highlight ATF's ability to
adaptively balance informativeness and minimalism across tasks.

Conclusion: TAIRA通过思维增强和任务分解，显著提升了处理复杂用户意图的能力，为交互式推荐系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Interactive recommendation is a typical information-seeking task that allows
users to interactively express their needs through natural language and obtain
personalized recommendations. Large language model-powered (LLM-powered) agents
have become a new paradigm in interactive recommendations, effectively
capturing users' real-time needs and enhancing personalized experiences.
However, due to limited planning and generalization capabilities, existing
formulations of LLM-powered interactive recommender agents struggle to
effectively address diverse and complex user intents, such as intuitive,
unrefined, or occasionally ambiguous requests. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA)
that addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns.
Specifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring
a manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user
needs and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through
Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts
high-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover,
we designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries
of different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific
datasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets,
TAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods.
Notably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while
generalizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in
managing complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems. The
code is publicly available at:https://github.com/Alcein/TAIRA.

Result: SFT快速学习新任务但遗忘先验知识，RFT学习慢但保留知识，数据分布是关键因素。

Conclusion: RFT在多模态大语言模型中具有稳定持续学习的潜力，数据分布是遗忘的核心因素。

Abstract: Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large
language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their
impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw
puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and
systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal
model, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid
task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more
slowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon
through the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct
samples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape,
mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on
correct RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly
learning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than
algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight
RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language
models.

Method: 通过人工标注20个LLM生成的食谱，分析其成分和步骤的记忆性、创造性和无意义性；设计自动化框架（LLM-as-judge）进行大规模评估。

Result: 发现Mixtral模型依赖记忆内容；自动化框架中，Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B在成分匹配上达到78%准确率。

Conclusion: 自动化框架能有效量化LLMs生成食谱的记忆性、创造性和无意义性，为模型创造能力提供严谨证据。

Abstract: This work-in-progress investigates the memorization, creativity, and nonsense
found in cooking recipes generated from Large Language Models (LLMs).
Precisely, we aim (i) to analyze memorization, creativity, and non-sense in
LLMs using a small, high-quality set of human judgments and (ii) to evaluate
potential approaches to automate such a human annotation in order to scale our
study to hundreds of recipes. To achieve (i), we conduct a detailed human
annotation on 20 preselected recipes generated by LLM (Mixtral), extracting
each recipe's ingredients and step-by-step actions to assess which elements are
memorized--i.e., directly traceable to online sources possibly seen during
training--and which arise from genuine creative synthesis or outright nonsense.
We find that Mixtral consistently reuses ingredients that can be found in
online documents, potentially seen during model training, suggesting strong
reliance on memorized content. To achieve aim (ii) and scale our analysis
beyond small sample sizes and single LLM validation, we design an
``LLM-as-judge'' pipeline that automates recipe generation, nonsense detection,
parsing ingredients and recipe steps, and their annotation. For instance,
comparing its output against human annotations, the best ingredient extractor
and annotator is Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieving up to 78% accuracy on
ingredient matching. This automated framework enables large-scale
quantification of memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated recipes,
providing rigorous evidence of the models' creative capacities.

TL;DR: SemDiD是一种新的解码方法，通过嵌入空间操作提升语义多样性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成多样响应时主要关注词汇而非语义多样性，限制了应用效果。

Method: SemDiD结合正交方向引导、动态组间排斥和位置去偏概率评估，平衡质量与多样性。

Result: 实验显示SemDiD在多样任务中覆盖率和准确性均有提升，加速RLHF训练。

Conclusion: SemDiD有效解决了语义多样性问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications
requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods
primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation
significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement
learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam
search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to
ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided
Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances
quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal
directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased
probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using
adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality
thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD
consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by
1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15%
while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.

TL;DR: LLMs可以生成合成行为数据，但能否准确反映人格特质驱动的心理差异尚不确定。研究发现，某些人格特质（如宜人性和尽责性）与错误信息易感性的关联可被LLM复制，但其他特质存在偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM生成的数据是否能准确模拟人格特质对行为的影响，特别是在错误信息辨别方面。

Method: 利用已知人格特质的真实人类数据，创建匹配的LLM代理，比较其与人类在新闻辨别任务中的表现。

Result: LLM能复制某些人格特质（如宜人性、尽责性）与错误信息易感性的关联，但其他特质存在系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLM在行为模拟中具有潜力，但也存在局限性，为人工代理的认知多样性建模提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make it possible to generate synthetic
behavioural data at scale, offering an ethical and low-cost alternative to
human experiments. Whether such data can faithfully capture psychological
differences driven by personality traits, however, remains an open question. We
evaluate the capacity of LLM agents, conditioned on Big-Five profiles, to
reproduce personality-based variation in susceptibility to misinformation,
focusing on news discernment, the ability to judge true headlines as true and
false headlines as false. Leveraging published datasets in which human
participants with known personality profiles rated headline accuracy, we create
matching LLM agents and compare their responses to the original human patterns.
Certain trait-misinformation associations, notably those involving
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, are reliably replicated, whereas others
diverge, revealing systematic biases in how LLMs internalize and express
personality. The results underscore both the promise and the limits of
personality-aligned LLMs for behavioral simulation, and offer new insight into
modeling cognitive diversity in artificial agents.

Motivation: 评估文本分类系统的鲁棒性，通过最小修改改变模型预测。

Method: 扩展BeamAttack算法，支持单词删除和跳过替换，集成LIME优化替换优先级。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上攻击成功率达99%，保持语义和词汇相似性。

Conclusion: BeamAttack有效但存在局限性，代码已开源。

Abstract: We extend BeamAttack, an adversarial attack algorithm designed to evaluate
the robustness of text classification systems through word-level modifications
guided by beam search. Our extensions include support for word deletions and
the option to skip substitutions, enabling the discovery of minimal
modifications that alter model predictions. We also integrate LIME to better
prioritize word replacements. Evaluated across multiple datasets and victim
models (BiLSTM, BERT, and adversarially trained RoBERTa) within the BODEGA
framework, our approach achieves over a 99\% attack success rate while
preserving the semantic and lexical similarity of the original texts. Through
both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we highlight BeamAttack's
effectiveness and its limitations. Our implementation is available at

TL;DR: ZEST是一种零样本上下文适应框架，通过合成代理语料库替代真实语料库访问，在隐私敏感或资源受限环境中实现高效检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决上下文感知嵌入方法需要访问目标语料库或领域特定微调的问题，适用于隐私敏感或资源受限场景。

Method: 使用多步分层程序生成合成代理语料库，模拟关键领域特定分布，无需微调或目标语料库访问。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中，仅用五个示例文档的ZEST性能接近全目标语料库访问模型的0.5%。

Conclusion: ZEST为受限环境中部署高性能、适应性强的嵌入提供了一种实用方法。

Abstract: Context-aware embedding methods boost retrieval accuracy by conditioning on
corpus statistics (e.g., term co-occurrence and topical patterns) extracted
from neighboring documents. However, this context-aware approach requires
access to the target corpus or requires domain-specific finetuning, posing
practical barriers in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. We
present ZEST, a zero-shot contextual adaptation framework that replaces real
corpus access with a one-time offline synthesis of a compact proxy. Given only
a handful exemplar documents representative of the general target domain, we
use a multi-step hierarchical procedure to generate a synthetic context corpus
of several hundred documents that aims to emulate key domain-specific
distributions. At inference, the frozen context-aware encoder uses this proxy
corpus -- without any finetuning or target corpus access -- to produce
domain-adapted embeddings. Across the MTEB benchmark, ZEST's zero-shot
synthetic context adaptation using only five example documents performs within
0.5% of models leveraging full target corpus access -- demonstrating remarkable
efficacy without any retraining. ZEST thus provides a practical method for
deploying high-performance, adaptable embeddings in constrained environments.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在多轮、长时任务中作为自主智能体的可扩展性和训练效率问题。

Method: 引入 L0 训练管道和 NB-Agent 框架，采用代码驱动的动作执行方式（REPL），并通过可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）训练模型。

Result: 在 SimpleQA 和 HotpotQA 基准测试中，准确率分别从 30% 提升至 80% 和从 22% 提升至 41%。

Conclusion: L0 系统通过高效的训练方法和代码驱动的智能体框架，显著提升了模型在复杂任务中的表现，并已开源。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to act as autonomous agents for
multi-turn, long-horizon tasks remains significant challenges in scalability
and training efficiency. To address this, we introduce L-Zero (L0), a scalable,
end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents. Featuring a low-cost,
extensible, and sandboxed concurrent agent worker pool, L0 lowers the barrier
for applying reinforcement learning in complex environments. We also introduce
NB-Agent, the agent scaffold within L0, which operates in a "code-as-action"
fashion via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). We evaluate L0 on factuality
question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that a base model
can develop robust problem-solving skills using solely Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). On the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, our method
boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30 % to 80 % and on HotpotQA from 22 % to 41
%. We have open-sourced the entire L0 system, including our L0 series models,
the NB-Agent, a complete training pipeline, and the corresponding training

TL;DR: AutoEvoEval是一个基于进化的评估框架，用于生成多样化和具有挑战性的测试样本，以更全面地评估大型语言模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准多为静态，无法充分评估大型语言模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出AutoEvoEval框架，引入22种可解释的原子进化操作，支持多轮组合生成测试样本。

Result: 实验显示原子操作导致平均准确率下降7.283%，结构破坏或误导性语义编辑影响最大，多步组合可放大对抗效应达52.932%。

Conclusion: 当前基准可能高估模型泛化能力，需进化感知的鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various
tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to
fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior
work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved
evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and
multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for
close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval
introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports
multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse,
challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments
addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source
LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of
7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the
largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same
perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial
effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may
overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for
evolution-aware robustness evaluation. Code and resources are available at:

*Tiziano Labruna,Simone Gallo,Giovanni Da San Martino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究量化并分析了五种大型语言模型在二进制问答中的位置偏差，发现低不确定性条件下偏差几乎不存在，但高不确定性时偏差呈指数增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示模型在二进制问答中因选项顺序而产生的系统性偏好，尤其是在不同不确定性条件下的表现。

Method: 通过调整SQuAD-it数据集，增加错误选项并逐步减少上下文，创建不同不确定性的数据集。同时评估WebGPT和Winning Arguments两个高不确定性基准。

Result: 位置偏差在低不确定性条件下几乎不存在，但在高不确定性条件下显著增加。

Conclusion: 位置偏差与不确定性密切相关，高不确定性会加剧模型对选项顺序的依赖。

Abstract: Positional bias in binary question answering occurs when a model
systematically favors one choice over another based solely on the ordering of
presented options. In this study, we quantify and analyze positional bias
across five large language models under varying degrees of answer uncertainty.
We re-adapted the SQuAD-it dataset by adding an extra incorrect answer option
and then created multiple versions with progressively less context and more
out-of-context answers, yielding datasets that range from low to high
uncertainty. Additionally, we evaluate two naturally higher-uncertainty
benchmarks: (1) WebGPT - question pairs with unequal human-assigned quality
scores, and (2) Winning Arguments - where models predict the more persuasive
argument in Reddit's r/ChangeMyView exchanges. Across each dataset, the order
of the "correct" (or higher-quality/persuasive) option is systematically
flipped (first placed in position 1, then in position 2) to compute both
Preference Fairness and Position Consistency. We observe that positional bias
is nearly absent under low-uncertainty conditions, but grows exponentially when
it becomes doubtful to decide which option is correct.

TL;DR: 论文提出DuP-PO算法，解决大型推理模型（LRMs）在处理简单任务时因过度思考而效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在简单任务中因过度思考（如使用过多思考标记）导致效率下降，影响推理性能。

Method: 提出Dual Policy Preference Optimization（DuP-PO）算法，包括平衡采样策略、细粒度优势控制和策略塑造方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，DuP-PO显著提高了模型的标记效率，同时保持了基础模型的性能。

Conclusion: DuP-PO有效解决了LRMs的过度思考问题，提升了推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems but face an
overthinking dilemma. When handling simple tasks, they often produce verbose
responses overloaded with thinking tokens (e.g., wait, however). These tokens
trigger unnecessary high-level reasoning behaviors like reflection and
backtracking, reducing efficiency. In this work, our pilot study reveals that
these thinking-token-induced behaviors are not essential for effective
problem-solving and may even hinder correct reasoning within constrained token
budgets. We identify this phenomenon as the thinking trap. To mitigate this
issue, we propose Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO), a novel
algorithm featuring: (1) A rollout sampling strategy that guarantees balanced
exposure to responses with and without thinking tokens; (2) A fine-grained
advantage control technique to dynamically regulate the prediction of target
tokens; (3) A policy shaping method ensuring stable gradient contributions from
thinking tokens. Experimental results on five popular math reasoning benchmarks
show that DuP-PO performs well on the popular LRM, which significantly improves
their token efficiency during reasoning, while achieving superior performance
of the base model.

Motivation: 挑战当前基于基准的LLM推理能力评估的有效性，揭示基准设计和评分方法的不足，推动更可靠的评估协议。

Method: 使用五个LLM（GPT-3、3.5、4、o1和LLaMA 3.1）作为诊断工具，结合系统性人工标注和重新评估清理后的基准子集。

Result: 发现基准设计存在重复项、模糊措辞和不可信答案等问题，模型分数提升常因表面措辞变化而非推理改进。模型性能对输入微小变化高度敏感。

Conclusion: 当前基准评估可能误导对LLM推理能力的判断，需开发更注重推理过程的评估协议。论文发布了审计数据和工具以支持更可解释的评估。

Abstract: We conduct a systematic audit of three widely used reasoning benchmarks,
SocialIQa, FauxPas-EAI, and ToMi, and uncover pervasive flaws in both benchmark
items and evaluation methodology. Using five LLMs (GPT-{3, 3.5, 4, o1}, and
LLaMA 3.1) as diagnostic tools, we identify structural, semantic, and pragmatic
issues in benchmark design (e.g., duplicated items, ambiguous wording, and
implausible answers), as well as scoring procedures that prioritize output form
over reasoning process. Through systematic human annotation and re-evaluation
on cleaned benchmark subsets, we find that model scores often improve not due
to due to erratic surface wording variations and not to improved reasoning.
Infact, further analyses show that model performance is highly sensitive to
minor input variations such as context availability and phrasing, revealing
that high scores may reflect alignment with format-specific cues rather than
consistent inference based on the input. These findings challenge the validity
of current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the
need for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing
inference from available information, rather than as static output selection.
We release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and
diagnostic assessments of model reasoning.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在问题解决能力上有显著提升，但在复杂多步推理任务中仍表现不佳，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: MAPS框架采用迭代优化过程，结合CoT生成初始解，通过自适应自我反思机制检测错误并生成定制提示，动态调整推理过程。

Conclusion: MAPS为LLMs在多步推理任务中提供了一种高效解决方案，平衡了性能与成本，展示了通用模型接近专用模型的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still
struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework,
a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs
by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and
Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an
iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using
CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism
identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections.
These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its
reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs
show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive
results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables
general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized
reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also
increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically
limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning
performance.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决现有方法在评估LLM知识真实性时的缺陷，并提出更可靠的验证方法。

Method: 方法基于多实例学习和符合预测，利用LLM的内部激活状态将陈述分为真、假或两者都不是。

Result: 研究发现：真实性信号集中在LLM深度的第三部分；真假信号不对称；线性探针在聊天模型中表现更好；非线性探针适用于某些LLM；LLM还捕获第三种信号（非真非假）。

Conclusion: sAwMIL为验证LLM的“知识”及其确定性提供了可靠方法。

Abstract: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and
claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic
knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we
assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for
probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed.
To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse
Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal
activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither.
sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We
evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including
both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the
insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the
third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always
symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default
models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for
some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge
distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from
true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable
method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their
probabilistic internal knowledge.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多语言任务中表现出色，但其对非英语语言（尤其是形态学）的深层理解能力尚不明确。

Method: 引入IMPACT框架，通过合成数据评估LLMs在阿拉伯语、俄语、芬兰语、土耳其语和希伯来语中的形态学表现，涵盖基本和独特特征。

Result: 评估的八种多语言LLMs在非英语语言和罕见形态模式上表现不佳，尤其是对不合语法例子的判断能力较弱。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言复杂性处理上存在明显不足，需要进一步改进。IMPACT框架已公开以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress on various
multilingual benchmarks and are increasingly used to generate and evaluate text
in non-English languages. However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it
remains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying
linguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To
investigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation
framework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release,
designed to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich
languages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes
unit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena,
from basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features
like Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and
Turkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English
performance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns,
especially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of
Thought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in
LLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for
improvement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT
framework.

Conclusion: 隐喻提示是一种有效的仇恨言论检测方法，尤其在低资源语言中，同时考虑了环境影响的评估。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate
speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.
Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent
code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content
on social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is
typically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource
languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,
high-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this
limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on
low-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -
zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot
prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to
detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the
metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that
marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We
investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and
compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,
Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer
perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated
recurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in
the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource
language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The
performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and
environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity
usage, and computational time.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models and vision-language models have led
to growing interest in explainable evaluation metrics for image captioning.
However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and
the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this
paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides
structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency,
relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of
high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一参数集成框架，通过兼容性感知参数拼接（CAPS）策略，实现领域专用MLLMs的知识共享与模块化组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决领域专用MLLMs知识碎片化问题，探索知识共享的可能性。

Method: 采用CAPS策略，结合局部功能归因和全局信息论信号，实现选择性参数融合，并引入领域兼容性评分机制。

Result: 在多样化多模态基准测试中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建可组合、领域自适应的MLLMs提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various
domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with
different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned
for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing
among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or
code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge
across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration
framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method
is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy,
which leverages both local functional attribution and global
information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending
this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure
efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we
introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert
alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility.
This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize
heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive
evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive
MLLMs.

TL;DR: 论文研究了前沿AI开发者用于防止AI系统灾难性滥用的防御管线的安全性，开发并测试了一种开源防御管线，发现其性能优于现有模型，但同时也提出了一种新的攻击方法STACK，成功率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI开发者依赖多层防护措施防止AI系统被滥用，但这些防护管线的安全性尚未充分评估。

Method: 开发并测试了一种开源防御管线，提出了一种新的攻击方法STACK，并在不同设置下评估其效果。

Result: 新型防御管线在灾难性滥用数据集上表现优异，但STACK攻击方法在无目标管线访问的情况下仍能实现较高成功率。

Conclusion: 开发者需采取特定措施以抵御分阶段攻击，防护管线设计需进一步优化。

Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against
catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus
model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including
Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the
security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or
attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an
open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted
input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard
model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack
success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second,
we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on
ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier
pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33%
ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no
access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations
that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

Motivation: 探索SAE在句子分类任务中的解释性效果，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 提出了一种新的SAE架构，结合专用分类器头和激活率稀疏损失，并与现有方法（如ConceptShap、ICA等）进行对比。

Result: 实验结果表明，新架构在因果性和可解释性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAE在句子分类中具有潜力，新架构为解释性研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been successfully used to probe Large
Language Models (LLMs) and extract interpretable concepts from their internal
representations. These concepts are linear combinations of neuron activations
that correspond to human-interpretable features. In this paper, we investigate
the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches for sentence
classification, a domain where such methods have not been extensively explored.
We present a novel SAE-based architecture tailored for text classification,
leveraging a specialized classifier head and incorporating an activation rate
sparsity loss. We benchmark this architecture against established methods such
as ConceptShap, Independent Component Analysis, and other SAE-based concept
extraction techniques. Our evaluation covers two classification benchmarks and
four fine-tuned LLMs from the Pythia family. We further enrich our analysis
with two novel metrics for measuring the precision of concept-based
explanations, using an external sentence encoder. Our empirical results show
that our architecture improves both the causality and interpretability of the
extracted features.

Result: 使用TaP生成数据集训练的LLM性能优于现有开源数据集，甚至优于规模大180倍的数据集。

Conclusion: TaP框架为多语言偏好数据集的构建提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了LLM的性能。

Abstract: Conducting supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning on large
language models (LLMs) requires high-quality datasets to improve their ability
to follow instructions and align with human preferences and values. However,
constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets
for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these
challenges, we propose the \underline{\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided
\underline{\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which
facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across
various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows
fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity
and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform
supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those
trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on
TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an
open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

*Yanhong Li,Ming Li,Karen Livescu,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型预测文本的能力与其嵌入空间的广度密切相关，嵌入空间越分散，困惑度越低。研究发现，表示分散度与困惑度呈强负相关，可用于模型选择、检索优化和训练目标改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型嵌入空间的分散度与困惑度之间的关系，并利用这一关系提升模型性能。

Method: 通过测量隐藏向量间的平均余弦距离（表示分散度），分析其与困惑度的相关性，并设计实验验证分散度在模型选择、检索优化和训练目标中的应用。

Result: 表示分散度与困惑度呈强负相关；分散度可用于预测下游任务准确性、优化检索层选择，并通过训练目标改进直接提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 嵌入空间的分散度是语言模型性能的关键指标，可广泛应用于模型优化和任务改进。

Abstract: We show that a language model's ability to predict text is tightly linked to
the breadth of its embedding space: models that spread their contextual
representations more widely tend to achieve lower perplexity. Concretely, we
find that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance
among hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity
across diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia,
news, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how
dispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring
labeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to
predict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for
model selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion
pinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM,
bypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple
push-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both
single-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in
each.

Abstract: Scientific information expresses human understanding of nature. This
knowledge is largely disseminated in different forms of text, including
scientific papers, news articles, and discourse among people on social media.
While important for accelerating our pursuit of knowledge, not all scientific
text is faithful to the underlying science. As the volume of this text has
burgeoned online in recent years, it has become a problem of societal
importance to be able to identify the faithfulness of a given piece of
scientific text automatically. This thesis is concerned with the cultivation of
datasets, methods, and tools for machine understanding of scientific language,
in order to analyze and understand science communication at scale. To arrive at
this, I present several contributions in three areas of natural language
processing and machine learning: automatic fact checking, learning with limited
data, and scientific text processing. These contributions include new methods
and resources for identifying check-worthy claims, adversarial claim
generation, multi-source domain adaptation, learning from crowd-sourced labels,
cite-worthiness detection, zero-shot scientific fact checking, detecting
exaggerated scientific claims, and modeling degrees of information change in
science communication. Critically, I demonstrate how the research outputs of
this thesis are useful for effectively learning from limited amounts of
scientific text in order to identify misinformative scientific statements and
generate new insights into the science communication process

Conclusion: 该自动化流程为临床叙事分析提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，支持更深入的CHD患者体验研究。

Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often
underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives
offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic
analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully
automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on
clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full
transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where
specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with
human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable,
patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be
fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs如何支持数学学习，尤其是应用题解决，并评估其实际能力。

Method: 通过技术概述、文献综述和实证评估三部分，分析LLMs在数学应用题上的表现。

Result: LLMs在标准应用题上表现近乎完美，但在涉及现实背景的问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs虽能解决应用题，但缺乏对现实背景的理解，教育价值有限。

Abstract: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question
of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support
mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle
textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word
problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the
real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We
conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including
three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in
research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical
word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the
conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs
and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled
mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics
education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most
popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require
a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our
evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems
shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,
including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed
weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or
non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have
mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,
which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics
classrooms.

Method: 使用E5、AlephBERT、MPNet和LaBSE等模型生成词嵌入，通过余弦相似度和Wasserstein距离评估模型性能。

Result: E5在平行段落检测中表现最佳，AlephBERT在非平行段落区分中更强。

Conclusion: 预训练模型可提升古代文本互文关系检测的效率和准确性，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Identifying parallel passages in biblical Hebrew is foundational in biblical
scholarship for uncovering intertextual relationships. Traditional methods rely
on manual comparison, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. This
study evaluates the potential of pre-trained transformer-based language models,
including E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE, for detecting textual parallels in
the Hebrew Bible. Focusing on known parallels between the books of Samuel/Kings
and Chronicles, I assessed each model's capability to generate word embeddings
that delineate parallel from non-parallel passages. Utilizing cosine similarity
and Wasserstein Distance measures, I found that E5 and AlephBERT show
significant promise, with E5 excelling in parallel detection and AlephBERT
demonstrating stronger non-parallel differentiation. These findings indicate
that pre-trained models can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting
intertextual parallels in ancient texts, suggesting broader applications for
ancient language studies.

Motivation: 研究公众对安卓机器人在实际场景中的接受度和潜在用途，以优化其设计和功能。

Result: 性别提示无显著影响；访客主要希望机器人提供展品信息，并改进语言支持和响应速度。

Conclusion: 研究结果为优化安卓机器人提供了实用建议，以提升其在现实场景中的应用价值。

Abstract: The android robot Andrea was set up at a public museum in Germany for six
consecutive days to have conversations with visitors, fully autonomously. No
specific context was given, so visitors could state their opinions regarding
possible use-cases in structured interviews, without any bias. Additionally the
44 interviewees were asked for their general opinions of the robot, their
reasons (not) to interact with it and necessary improvements for future use.
The android's voice and wig were changed between different days of operation to
give varying cues regarding its gender. This did not have a significant impact
on the positive overall perception of the robot. Most visitors want the robot
to provide information about exhibits in the future, while opinions on other
roles, like a receptionist, were both wanted and explicitly not wanted by
different visitors. Speaking more languages (than only English) and faster
response times were the improvements most desired. These findings from the
interviews are in line with an analysis of the system logs, which revealed,
that after chitchat and personal questions, most of the 4436 collected requests
asked for information related to the museum and to converse in a different
language. The valuable insights gained from these real-world interactions are
now used to improve the system to become a useful real-world application.

Abstract: The movements of both animals and robots give rise to streams of
high-dimensional motor and sensory information. Imagine the brain of a newborn
or the controller of a baby humanoid robot trying to make sense of unprocessed
sensorimotor time series. Here, we present a framework for studying the dynamic
functional connectivity between the multimodal sensory signals of a robotic
agent to uncover an underlying structure. Using instantaneous mutual
information, we capture the time-varying functional connectivity (FC) between
proprioceptive, tactile, and visual signals, revealing the sensorimotor
relationships. Using an infinite relational model, we identified sensorimotor
modules and their evolving connectivity. To further interpret these dynamic
interactions, we employed non-negative matrix factorization, which decomposed
the connectivity patterns into additive factors and their corresponding
temporal coefficients. These factors can be considered the agent's motion
primitives or movement synergies that the agent can use to make sense of its
sensorimotor space and later for behavior selection. In the future, the method
can be deployed in robot learning as well as in the analysis of human movement
trajectories or brain signals.

Conclusion: 目标注意力机制可增强自动驾驶中视觉语言模型的可解释性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework, DriveBLIP2, built upon the BLIP2-OPT
architecture, to generate accurate and contextually relevant explanations for
emerging driving scenarios. While existing vision-language models perform well
in general tasks, they encounter difficulties in understanding complex,
multi-object environments, particularly in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving, where the rapid identification of key objects is crucial.
To address this limitation, an Attention Map Generator is proposed to highlight
significant objects relevant to driving decisions within critical video frames.
By directing the model's focus to these key regions, the generated attention
map helps produce clear and relevant explanations, enabling drivers to better
understand the vehicle's decision-making process in critical situations.
Evaluations on the DRAMA dataset reveal significant improvements in explanation
quality, as indicated by higher BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE scores compared
to baseline models. These findings underscore the potential of targeted
attention mechanisms in vision-language models for enhancing explainability in
real-time autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何设计实现低信息刺激下的高复杂度变形，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a simple, accessible method for autonomously transforming flat
plastic sheets into intricate three-dimensional structures using only uniform
heating and common tools such as household ovens and scissors. Our approach
combines heat-shrinkable thermoplastics with Kirigami patterns tailored to the
target 3D shape, creating bilayer composites that morph into a wide range of
complex structures, e.g., bowls, pyramids, and even custom ergonomic surfaces
like mouse covers. Critically, the transformation is driven by a
low-information stimulus (uniform heat) yet produces highly intricate shapes
through programmed geometric design. The morphing behavior, confirmed by finite
element simulations, arises from strain mismatch between the contracting
thermoplastic layer and the constraining Kirigami layer. By decoupling material
composition from mechanical response, this method avoids detailed process
control and enables a broad class of self-morphing structures, offering a
versatile platform for adaptive design and scalable manufacturing.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly playing key roles as support platforms for
human operators in high-risk, dangerous applications. To accomplish challenging
tasks, an efficient human-robot cooperation and understanding is required.
While typically robotic planning leverages 3D geometric information, human
operators are accustomed to a high-level compact representation of the
environment, like top-down 2D maps representing the Building Information Model
(BIM). 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool to bridge the gap
between human readable 2D BIM and the robot 3D maps. In this work, we introduce
Pixels-to-Graph (Pix2G), a novel lightweight method to generate structured
scene graphs from image pixels and LiDAR maps in real-time for the autonomous
exploration of unknown environments on resource-constrained robot platforms. To
satisfy onboard compute constraints, the framework is designed to perform all
operation on CPU only. The method output are a de-noised 2D top-down
environment map and a structure-segmented 3D pointcloud which are seamlessly
connected using a multi-layer graph abstracting information from object-level
up to the building-level. The proposed method is quantitatively and
qualitatively evaluated during real-world experiments performed using the NASA
JPL NeBula-Spot legged robot to autonomously explore and map cluttered garage

Abstract: Robust and adaptive robotic peg-in-hole assembly under tight tolerances is
critical to various industrial applications. However, it remains an open
challenge due to perceptual and physical uncertainties from contact-rich
interactions that easily exceed the allowed clearance. In this paper, we study
how to leverage contact between the peg and its matching hole to eliminate
uncertainties in the assembly process under unstructured settings. By examining
the role of compliance under contact constraints, we present a manipulation
system that plans collision-inclusive interactions for the peg to 1)
iteratively identify its task environment to localize the target hole and 2)
exploit environmental contact constraints to refine insertion motions into the
target hole without relying on precise perception, enabling a robust solution
to peg-in-hole assembly. By conceptualizing the above process as the
composition of funneling in different state spaces, we present a formal
approach to constructing manipulation funnels as an uncertainty-absorbing
paradigm for peg-in-hole assembly. The proposed system effectively generalizes
across diverse peg-in-hole scenarios across varying scales, shapes, and
materials in a learning-free manner. Extensive experiments on a NIST Assembly
Task Board (ATB) and additional challenging scenarios validate its robustness
in real-world applications.

Abstract: Garment manipulation is a significant challenge for robots due to the complex
dynamics and potential self-occlusion of garments. Most existing methods of
efficient garment unfolding overlook the crucial role of standardization of
flattened garments, which could significantly simplify downstream tasks like
folding, ironing, and packing. This paper presents APS-Net, a novel approach to
garment manipulation that combines unfolding and standardization in a unified
framework. APS-Net employs a dual-arm, multi-primitive policy with dynamic
fling to quickly unfold crumpled garments and pick-and-place (p and p) for
precise alignment. The purpose of garment standardization during unfolding
involves not only maximizing surface coverage but also aligning the garment's
shape and orientation to predefined requirements. To guide effective robot
learning, we introduce a novel factorized reward function for standardization,
which incorporates garment coverage (Cov), keypoint distance (KD), and
intersection-over-union (IoU) metrics. Additionally, we introduce a spatial
action mask and an Action Optimized Module to improve unfolding efficiency by
selecting actions and operation points effectively. In simulation, APS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for long sleeves, achieving 3.9 percent
better coverage, 5.2 percent higher IoU, and a 0.14 decrease in KD (7.09
percent relative reduction). Real-world folding tasks further demonstrate that
standardization simplifies the folding process. Project page: see

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合物理模型与Transformer架构的SPI-BoTER方法，用于工业机器人轨迹误差补偿，在小样本条件下实现了高精度和强泛化能力。

Motivation: 工业机器人末端执行器的轨迹精度需求日益严格，但现有误差补偿方法存在建模简化、数据驱动缺乏物理一致性及数据需求大等问题，难以同时实现高精度与强泛化。

Result: 在UR5机械臂小样本数据集上，3D绝对定位误差为0.2515 mm（标准差0.15 mm），较传统DNN方法误差降低35.16%；逆角度补偿算法平均147次迭代收敛至0.01 mm精度。

Conclusion: SPI-BoTER结合物理可解释性与数据适应性，为工业机器人高精度控制提供了有效解决方案，有望推动智能制造中精密任务的可靠执行。

Abstract: The widespread application of industrial robots in fields such as cutting and
welding has imposed increasingly stringent requirements on the trajectory
accuracy of end-effectors. However, current error compensation methods face
several critical challenges, including overly simplified mechanism modeling, a
lack of physical consistency in data-driven approaches, and substantial data
requirements. These issues make it difficult to achieve both high accuracy and
strong generalization simultaneously. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a Spatial-Physical Informed Attention Residual Network (SPI-BoTER).
This method integrates the kinematic equations of the robotic manipulator with
a Transformer architecture enhanced by sparse self-attention masks. A
parameter-adaptive hybrid loss function incorporating spatial and physical
information is employed to iteratively optimize the network during training,
enabling high-precision error compensation under small-sample conditions.
Additionally, inverse joint angle compensation is performed using a gradient
descent-based optimization method. Experimental results on a small-sample
dataset from a UR5 robotic arm (724 samples, with a train:test:validation split
of 8:1:1) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. It
achieves a 3D absolute positioning error of 0.2515 mm with a standard deviation
of 0.15 mm, representing a 35.16\% reduction in error compared to conventional
deep neural network (DNN) methods. Furthermore, the inverse angle compensation
algorithm converges to an accuracy of 0.01 mm within an average of 147
iterations. This study presents a solution that combines physical
interpretability with data adaptability for high-precision control of
industrial robots, offering promising potential for the reliable execution of
precision tasks in intelligent manufacturing.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to reliably execute complex multi-step manipulation
tasks is crucial for their effective deployment in industrial and household
environments. This paper presents a hierarchical planning and control framework
designed to achieve reliable multi-step humanoid manipulation. The proposed
system comprises three layers: (1) a low-level RL-based controller responsible
for tracking whole-body motion targets; (2) a mid-level set of skill policies
trained via imitation learning that produce motion targets for different steps
of a task; and (3) a high-level vision-language planning module that determines
which skills should be executed and also monitors their completion in real-time
using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). Experimental validation is
performed on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot executing a non-prehensile
pick-and-place task. Over 40 real-world trials, the hierarchical system
achieved a 72.5% success rate in completing the full manipulation sequence.
These experiments confirm the feasibility of the proposed hierarchical system,
highlighting the benefits of VLM-based skill planning and monitoring for
multi-step manipulation scenarios. See https://vlp-humanoid.github.io/ for

Abstract: Autonomous drifting is a complex and crucial maneuver for safety-critical
scenarios like slippery roads and emergency collision avoidance, requiring
precise motion planning and control. Traditional motion planning methods often
struggle with the high instability and unpredictability of drifting,
particularly when operating at high speeds. Recent learning-based approaches
have attempted to tackle this issue but often rely on expert knowledge or have
limited exploration capabilities. Additionally, they do not effectively address
safety concerns during learning and deployment. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based motion planner for
autonomous drifting. Our approach integrates an RL agent with model-based drift
dynamics to determine desired drift motion states, while incorporating a
Predictive Safety Filter (PSF) that adjusts the agent's actions online to
prevent unsafe states. This ensures safe and efficient learning, and stable
drift operation. We validate the effectiveness of our method through
simulations on a Matlab-Carsim platform, demonstrating significant improvements
in drift performance, reduced tracking errors, and computational efficiency
compared to traditional methods. This strategy promises to extend the
capabilities of autonomous vehicles in safety-critical maneuvers.

Abstract: The problem of multi-robot coverage control becomes significantly challenging
when multiple robots leave the mission space simultaneously to charge their
batteries, disrupting the underlying network topology for communication and
sensing. To address this, we propose a resilient network design and control
approach that allows robots to achieve the desired coverage performance while
satisfying energy constraints and maintaining network connectivity throughout
the mission. We model the combined motion, energy, and network dynamics of the
multirobot systems (MRS) as a hybrid system with three modes, i.e., coverage,
return-to-base, and recharge, respectively. We show that ensuring the energy
constraints can be transformed into designing appropriate guard conditions for
mode transition between each of the three modes. Additionally, we present a
systematic procedure to design, maintain, and reconfigure the underlying
network topology using an energy-aware bearing rigid network design, enhancing
the structural resilience of the MRS even when a subset of robots departs to
charge their batteries. Finally, we validate our proposed method using
numerical simulations.

Abstract: Exploring high-latitude lunar regions presents an extremely challenging
visual environment for robots. The low sunlight elevation angle and minimal
light scattering result in a visual field dominated by a high dynamic range
featuring long, dynamic shadows. Reproducing these conditions on Earth requires
sophisticated simulators and specialized facilities. We introduce a unique
dataset recorded at the LunaLab from the SnT - University of Luxembourg, an
indoor test facility designed to replicate the optical characteristics of
multiple lunar latitudes. Our dataset includes images, inertial measurements,
and wheel odometry data from robots navigating seven distinct trajectories
under multiple illumination scenarios, simulating high-latitude lunar
conditions from dawn to night time with and without the aid of headlights,
resulting in 88 distinct sequences containing a total of 1.3M images. Data was
captured using a stereo RGB-inertial sensor, a monocular monochrome camera, and
for the first time, a novel single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) camera. We
recorded both static and dynamic image sequences, with robots navigating at
slow (5 cm/s) and fast (50 cm/s) speeds. All data is calibrated, synchronized,
and timestamped, providing a valuable resource for validating perception tasks
from vision-based autonomous navigation to scientific imaging for future lunar
missions targeting high-latitude regions or those intended for robots operating

Conclusion: SAD-RL框架通过分层策略和场景化训练，显著提升了自动驾驶决策算法的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Developing decision-making algorithms for highly automated driving systems
remains challenging, since these systems have to operate safely in an open and
complex environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches can learn
comprehensive decision policies directly from experience and already show
promising results in simple driving tasks. However, current approaches fail to
achieve generalizability for more complex driving tasks and lack learning
efficiency. Therefore, we present Scenario-based Automated Driving
Reinforcement Learning (SAD-RL), the first framework that integrates
Reinforcement Learning (RL) of hierarchical policy in a scenario-based
environment. A high-level policy selects maneuver templates that are evaluated
and executed by a low-level control logic. The scenario-based environment
allows to control the training experience for the agent and to explicitly
introduce challenging, but rate situations into the training process. Our
experiments show that an agent trained using the SAD-RL framework can achieve
safe behaviour in easy as well as challenging situations efficiently. Our
ablation studies confirmed that both HRL and scenario diversity are essential
for achieving these results.

Abstract: The event camera, renowned for its high dynamic range and exceptional

However, the inherent noise in event streams complicates the selection of
high-quality map points, which critically determine the precision of state
estimation. To address this challenge, we propose Voxel-ESVIO, an event-based
stereo visual-inertial odometry system that utilizes voxel map management,
which efficiently filter out high-quality 3D points. Specifically, our
methodology utilizes voxel-based point selection and voxel-aware point
management to collectively optimize the selection and updating of map points on
a per-voxel basis. These synergistic strategies enable the efficient retrieval
of noise-resilient map points with the highest observation likelihood in
current frames, thereby ensureing the state estimation accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our Voxel-ESVIO
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Learning policies for complex humanoid tasks remains both challenging and
compelling. Inspired by how infants and athletes rely on external support--such
as parental walkers or coach-applied guidance--to acquire skills like walking,
dancing, and performing acrobatic flips, we propose A2CF: Adaptive Assistive
Curriculum Force for humanoid motion learning. A2CF trains a dual-agent system,
in which a dedicated assistive force agent applies state-dependent forces to
guide the robot through difficult initial motions and gradually reduces
assistance as the robot's proficiency improves. Across three
benchmarks--bipedal walking, choreographed dancing, and backflip--A2CF achieves
convergence 30% faster than baseline methods, lowers failure rates by over 40%,
and ultimately produces robust, support-free policies. Real-world experiments
further demonstrate that adaptively applied assistive forces significantly
accelerate the acquisition of complex skills in high-dimensional robotic

Abstract: 3D world models (i.e., learning-based 3D dynamics models) offer a promising
approach to generalizable robotic manipulation by capturing the underlying
physics of environment evolution conditioned on robot actions. However,
existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics
using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require
time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for
training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point
cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss,
supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material,
multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained
multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials,
trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate
scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene
forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics
learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction
scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world

Abstract: Collision-free optimal formation control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
teams is challenging. The state-of-the-art optimal control approaches often
rely on numerical methods sensitive to initial guesses. This paper presents an
innovative collision-free finite-time formation control scheme for multiple
UAVs leveraging the differential flatness of the UAV dynamics, eliminating the
need for numerical methods. We formulate a finite-time optimal control problem
to plan a formation trajectory for feasible initial states. This formation
trajectory planning optimal control problem involves a collective performance
index to meet the formation requirements of achieving relative positions and
velocity consensus. It is solved by applying Pontryagin's principle.
Subsequently, a collision-constrained regulating problem is addressed to ensure
collision-free tracking of the planned formation trajectory. The tracking
problem incorporates a directionally aware collision avoidance strategy that
prioritizes avoiding UAVs in the forward path and relative approach. It assigns
lower priority to those on the sides with an oblique relative approach and
disregards UAVs behind and not in the relative approach. The simulation results
for a four-UAV team (re)formation problem confirm the efficacy of the proposed
control scheme.

Abstract: Handover between a human and a dexterous robotic hand is a fundamental yet
challenging task in human-robot collaboration. It requires handling dynamic
environments and a wide variety of objects and demands robust and adaptive
grasping strategies. However, progress in developing effective dynamic
dexterous grasping methods is limited by the absence of high-quality,
real-world human-to-robot handover datasets. Existing datasets primarily focus
on grasping static objects or rely on synthesized handover motions, which
differ significantly from real-world robot motion patterns, creating a
substantial gap in applicability. In this paper, we introduce DexH2R, a
comprehensive real-world dataset for human-to-robot handovers, built on a
dexterous robotic hand. Our dataset captures a diverse range of interactive
objects, dynamic motion patterns, rich visual sensor data, and detailed
annotations. Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions,
we utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to
align with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for
intelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution,
DynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art
approaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods,
providing a thorough comparison and analysis. We believe our benchmark will
drive advancements in human-to-robot handover research by offering a

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle decisions rely on multimodal prediction models that
account for multiple route options and the inherent uncertainty in human
behavior. However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most
likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing
methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often
overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally,
traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and
do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none
of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we
propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint
trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce
metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the
sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory
prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When
looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves
closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable
to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode
becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new
insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction
models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Realistic and interactive traffic simulation is essential for training and
evaluating autonomous driving systems. However, most existing data-driven
simulation methods rely on static initialization or log-replay data, limiting
their ability to model dynamic, long-horizon scenarios with evolving agent
populations. We propose InfGen, a scenario generation framework that outputs
agent states and trajectories in an autoregressive manner. InfGen represents
the entire scene as a sequence of tokens, including traffic light signals,
agent states, and motion vectors, and uses a transformer model to simulate
traffic over time. This design enables InfGen to continuously insert new agents
into traffic, supporting infinite scene generation. Experiments demonstrate
that InfGen produces realistic, diverse, and adaptive traffic behaviors.
Furthermore, reinforcement learning policies trained in InfGen-generated
scenarios achieve superior robustness and generalization, validating its
utility as a high-fidelity simulation environment for autonomous driving. More

Abstract: Soft robotic systems are known for their flexibility and adaptability, but
traditional physics-based models struggle to capture their complex, nonlinear
behaviors. This study explores a data-driven approach to modeling the
volume-flow-pressure relationship in hydraulic soft actuators, focusing on
low-complexity models with high accuracy. We perform regression analysis on a
stacked balloon actuator system using exponential, polynomial, and neural
network models with or without autoregressive inputs. The results demonstrate
that simpler models, particularly multivariate polynomials, effectively predict
pressure dynamics with fewer parameters. This research offers a practical
solution for real-time soft robotics applications, balancing model complexity
and computational efficiency. Moreover, the approach may benefit various
techniques that require explicit analytical models.

Abstract: We implement and evaluate different methods for the reconfiguration of a
connected arrangement of tiles into a desired target shape, using a single
active robot that can move along the tile structure. This robot can pick up,
carry, or drop off one tile at a time, but it must maintain a single connected

  Becker et al. (CCCG 2025) recently proposed an algorithm that uses histograms
as canonical intermediate configurations, guaranteeing performance within a
constant factor of the optimal solution if the start and target configuration
are well-separated. We implement and evaluate this algorithm, both in a
simulated and practical setting, using an inchworm type robot to compare it
with two existing heuristic algorithms.

Abstract: While we have made significant algorithmic developments to enable autonomous

perform tasks effective and safely. Most existing approaches either fail to
provide any safety assurances or substantially compromise task performance for
safety. In this work, we develop a framework, based on model predictive control

autonomous systems while respecting the safety constraints. Our framework
guarantees recursive feasibility for the MPC controller, and it is scalable to
high-dimensional systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
with two simulation studies using a 4D Dubins Car and a 6 Dof Kuka iiwa
manipulator, and the experiments show that our framework significantly improves
the safety constraints satisfaction of the systems over the baselines.

Abstract: Efficient identification of picking points is critical for automated fruit
harvesting. Avocados present unique challenges owing to their irregular shape,
weight, and less-structured growing environments, which require specific
viewpoints for successful harvesting. We propose a geometry-based,
semantics-aware viewpoint-planning algorithm to address these challenges. The
planning process involves three key steps: viewpoint sampling, evaluation, and
execution. Starting from a partially occluded view, the system first detects
the fruit, then leverages geometric information to constrain the viewpoint
search space to a 1D circle, and uniformly samples four points to balance the
efficiency and exploration. A new picking score metric is introduced to
evaluate the viewpoint suitability and guide the camera to the next-best view.
We validate our method through simulation against two state-of-the-art
algorithms. Results show a 100% success rate in two case studies with
significant occlusions, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of our
approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/lineojcd/GSNBV

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for customized, on-demand production has grown in
the manufacturing sector. Additive Manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a
promising technology to enhance customization capabilities, enabling greater
flexibility, reduced lead times, and more efficient material usage. However,
traditional AM systems remain constrained by static setups and human worker
dependencies, resulting in long lead times and limited scalability. Mobile
robots can improve the flexibility of production systems by transporting
products to designated locations in a dynamic environment. By integrating AM
systems with mobile robots, manufacturers can optimize travel time for
preparatory tasks and distributed printing operations. Mobile AM robots have
been deployed for on-site production of large-scale structures, but often
neglect critical print quality metrics like surface roughness. Additionally,
these systems do not have the precision necessary for producing small,
intricate components. We propose a model predictive control framework for a
mobile AM platform that ensures safe navigation on the plant floor while
maintaining high print quality in a dynamic environment. Three case studies are
used to test the feasibility and reliability of the proposed systems.

Abstract: Improving automated vehicle software requires driving data rich in valuable
road user interactions. In this paper, we propose a risk-based filtering
approach that helps identify such valuable driving situations from large
datasets. Specifically, we use a probabilistic risk model to detect high-risk
situations. Our method stands out by considering a) first-order situations
(where one vehicle directly influences another and induces risk) and b)
second-order situations (where influence propagates through an intermediary
vehicle). In experiments, we show that our approach effectively selects
valuable driving situations in the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Compared to the
two baseline interaction metrics of Kalman difficulty and Tracks-To-Predict
(TTP), our filtering approach identifies complex and complementary situations,
enriching the quality in automated vehicle testing. The risk data is made

Conclusion: MGPRL为资源受限设备提供了一种无需预校准的高效定位方案，并开源了ROS实现。

Abstract: Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems
operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot
relative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like
cameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high
computational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint
environments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel
distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull
of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ
co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware
multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based
alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI
field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are
utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative
localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations
with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with
limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi
RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or
offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed
MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,
comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase
that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and
computational efficiency. Finally, we open source MGPRL as a ROS package

Conclusion: 该研究为解决拥挤环境中机器人护送问题提供了有效方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen
significant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However,
most current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,
assuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded
environments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to
keep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As
a result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective
escorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement
dynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must
continuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process
and adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing
dataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of
escorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where
other individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to
identify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting
their actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification
and action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network
architecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust
its speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume
escorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong
baselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness,
showcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in
complex, real-world scenarios.

Result: PTOPP在配置性、解决方案最优性和效率上显著优于现有方法（如基于间隙的方法）。

Conclusion: PTOPP为自由空间优化提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于广泛的路径规划问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new paradigm of optimal path planning, i.e.,
passage-traversing optimal path planning (PTOPP), that optimizes paths'
traversed passages for specified optimization objectives. In particular, PTOPP
is utilized to find the path with optimal accessible free space along its
entire length, which represents a basic requirement for paths in robotics. As
passages are places where free space shrinks and becomes constrained, the core
idea is to leverage the path's passage traversal status to characterize its
accessible free space comprehensively. To this end, a novel passage detection
and free space decomposition method using proximity graphs is proposed,
enabling fast detection of sparse but informative passages and environment
decompositions. Based on this preprocessing, optimal path planning with
accessible free space objectives or constraints is formulated as PTOPP problems
compatible with sampling-based optimal planners. Then, sampling-based
algorithms for PTOPP, including their dependent primitive procedures, are
developed leveraging partitioned environments for fast passage traversal check.
All these methods are implemented and thoroughly tested for effectiveness and
efficiency validation. Compared to existing approaches, such as clearance-based
methods, PTOPP demonstrates significant advantages in configurability, solution
optimality, and efficiency, addressing prior limitations and incapabilities. It
is believed to provide an efficient and versatile solution to accessible free
space optimization over conventional avenues and more generally, to a broad
class of path planning problems that can be formulated as PTOPP.

Abstract: Automated inspection with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) is a transformative
capability set to revolutionize various application domains. However, this task
is inherently complex, as it demands the seamless integration of perception,
planning, and control which existing approaches often treat separately.
Moreover, it requires accurate long-horizon planning to predict action
sequences, in contrast to many current techniques, which tend to be myopic. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D inspection approach that unifies
perception, planning, and control within a single data-driven predictive
control framework. Unlike traditional methods that rely on known UAS dynamic
models, our approach requires only input-output data, making it easily
applicable to off-the-shelf black-box UASs. Our method incorporates back-face
elimination, a visibility determination technique from 3D computer graphics,
directly into the control loop, thereby enabling the online generation of
accurate, long-horizon 3D inspection trajectories.

Abstract: The adoption of mobile robotic platforms in complex environments, such as
agricultural settings, requires these systems to exhibit a flexible yet
effective architecture that integrates perception and control. In such
scenarios, several tasks need to be accomplished simultaneously, ranging from
managing robot limits to performing operational tasks and handling human
inputs. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive control
architecture for achieving complex tasks such as robotized harvesting in
vineyards within the framework of the European project CANOPIES. In detail, a
16-DOF dual-arm mobile robot is employed, controlled via a Hierarchical
Quadratic Programming (HQP) approach capable of handling both equality and
inequality constraints at various priorities to harvest grape bunches selected
by the perception system developed within the project. Furthermore, given the
complexity of the scenario and the uncertainty in the perception system, which
could potentially lead to collisions with the environment, the handling of
interaction forces is necessary. Remarkably, this was achieved using the same
HQP framework. This feature is further leveraged to enable semi-autonomous
operations, allowing a human operator to assist the robotic counterpart in
completing harvesting tasks. Finally, the obtained results are validated
through extensive testing conducted first in a laboratory environment to prove
individual functionalities, then in a real vineyard, encompassing both
autonomous and semi-autonomous grape harvesting operations.

Motivation: 尽管VLMs在机器人操作任务中广泛应用，但其对低层物理前提的理解尚未验证，可能影响可靠性。

Method: 引入PAC Bench，包含多样化的数据集和任务，系统评估VLMs对物理概念的理解。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs在基础物理概念理解上存在显著不足。

Conclusion: PAC Bench为VLM的物理推理能力提供了标准化评估，并指导开发更鲁棒的模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly pivotal for generalist robot
manipulation, enabling tasks such as physical reasoning, policy generation, and
failure detection. However, their proficiency in these high-level applications
often assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a
capability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions
reliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,
weight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical
constraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being
closed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue
that off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded
understanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of
core Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability
perspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,
comprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1
to 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,
and 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.
  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to
grasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their
suitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for
targeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for
rigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of
more robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and realistic interactions between automated driving systems
and vulnerable road users (VRUs) in urban environments requires advanced
testing methodologies. This paper presents a test environment that combines a
Vehiclein-the-Loop (ViL) test bench with a motion laboratory, demonstrating the
feasibility of cyber-physical (CP) testing of vehicle-pedestrian and
vehicle-cyclist interactions. Building upon previous work focused on pedestrian
localization, we further validate a human pose estimation (HPE) approach
through a comparative analysis of real-world (RW) and virtual representations
of VRUs. The study examines the perception of full-body motion using a
commercial monocular camera-based 3Dskeletal detection AI. The virtual scene is
generated in Unreal Engine 5, where VRUs are animated in real time and
projected onto a screen to stimulate the camera. The proposed stimulation
technique ensures the correct perspective, enabling realistic vehicle
perception. To assess the accuracy and consistency of HPE across RW and CP
domains, we analyze the reliability of detections as well as variations in
movement trajectories and joint estimation stability. The validation includes
dynamic test scenarios where human avatars, both walking and cycling, are
monitored under controlled conditions. Our results show a strong alignment in
HPE between RW and CP test conditions for stable motion patterns, while notable
inaccuracies persist under dynamic movements and occlusions, particularly for
complex cyclist postures. These findings contribute to refining CP testing
approaches for evaluating next-generation AI-based vehicle perception and to

Conclusion: 多时间尺度分层强化学习方法有效解决了自动驾驶中策略结构设计不足的问题，实现了驾驶行为与控制的统一优化。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly used in autonomous driving (AD)
and shows clear advantages. However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy
structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle
control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in
network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals
cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore,
we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our
approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL
policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and
short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is
explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving
behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state
updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure
multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based
highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly
improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action
consistency and safety.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了本体感觉偏移问题，提升了模仿学习在机器人任务中的性能。

Abstract: Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal
inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While
proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle
avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising
degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the
underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions
of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment.
To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that
bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using
Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout
proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of
states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances
robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and
deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate
the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage
proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms
the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed
to address distributional shifts.

Abstract: The safe trajectory planning of intelligent and connected vehicles is a key
component in autonomous driving technology. Modeling the environment risk
information by field is a promising and effective approach for safe trajectory
planning. However, existing risk assessment theories only analyze the risk by
current information, ignoring future prediction. This paper proposes a
predictive risk analysis and safe trajectory planning framework for intelligent
and connected vehicles. This framework first predicts future trajectories of
objects by a local risk-aware algorithm, following with a
spatiotemporal-discretised predictive risk analysis using the prediction
results. Then the safe trajectory is generated based on the predictive risk
analysis. Finally, simulation and vehicle experiments confirm the efficacy and
real-time practicability of our approach.

Method: 通过结构化访谈和系统日志分析，收集访客对机器人用途、性别线索的看法及改进建议。

Result: 机器人总体评价积极，性别线索无显著影响；访客希望机器人提供展品信息，改进多语言支持和响应速度。

Conclusion: 研究结果为改进机器人系统提供了实用建议，以更好地满足实际应用需求。

Abstract: The android robot Andrea was set up at a public museum in Germany for six
consecutive days to have conversations with visitors, fully autonomously. No
specific context was given, so visitors could state their opinions regarding
possible use-cases in structured interviews, without any bias. Additionally the
44 interviewees were asked for their general opinions of the robot, their
reasons (not) to interact with it and necessary improvements for future use.
The android's voice and wig were changed between different days of operation to
give varying cues regarding its gender. This did not have a significant impact
on the positive overall perception of the robot. Most visitors want the robot
to provide information about exhibits in the future, while opinions on other
roles, like a receptionist, were both wanted and explicitly not wanted by
different visitors. Speaking more languages (than only English) and faster
response times were the improvements most desired. These findings from the
interviews are in line with an analysis of the system logs, which revealed,
that after chitchat and personal questions, most of the 4436 collected requests
asked for information related to the museum and to converse in a different
language. The valuable insights gained from these real-world interactions are
now used to improve the system to become a useful real-world application.

Abstract: The movements of both animals and robots give rise to streams of
high-dimensional motor and sensory information. Imagine the brain of a newborn
or the controller of a baby humanoid robot trying to make sense of unprocessed
sensorimotor time series. Here, we present a framework for studying the dynamic
functional connectivity between the multimodal sensory signals of a robotic
agent to uncover an underlying structure. Using instantaneous mutual
information, we capture the time-varying functional connectivity (FC) between
proprioceptive, tactile, and visual signals, revealing the sensorimotor
relationships. Using an infinite relational model, we identified sensorimotor
modules and their evolving connectivity. To further interpret these dynamic
interactions, we employed non-negative matrix factorization, which decomposed
the connectivity patterns into additive factors and their corresponding
temporal coefficients. These factors can be considered the agent's motion
primitives or movement synergies that the agent can use to make sense of its
sensorimotor space and later for behavior selection. In the future, the method
can be deployed in robot learning as well as in the analysis of human movement
trajectories or brain signals.

Conclusion: 定向注意力机制可增强实时自动驾驶中的解释能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework, DriveBLIP2, built upon the BLIP2-OPT
architecture, to generate accurate and contextually relevant explanations for
emerging driving scenarios. While existing vision-language models perform well
in general tasks, they encounter difficulties in understanding complex,
multi-object environments, particularly in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving, where the rapid identification of key objects is crucial.
To address this limitation, an Attention Map Generator is proposed to highlight
significant objects relevant to driving decisions within critical video frames.
By directing the model's focus to these key regions, the generated attention
map helps produce clear and relevant explanations, enabling drivers to better
understand the vehicle's decision-making process in critical situations.
Evaluations on the DRAMA dataset reveal significant improvements in explanation
quality, as indicated by higher BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE scores compared
to baseline models. These findings underscore the potential of targeted
attention mechanisms in vision-language models for enhancing explainability in
real-time autonomous driving.

Abstract: We present a simple, accessible method for autonomously transforming flat
plastic sheets into intricate three-dimensional structures using only uniform
heating and common tools such as household ovens and scissors. Our approach
combines heat-shrinkable thermoplastics with Kirigami patterns tailored to the
target 3D shape, creating bilayer composites that morph into a wide range of
complex structures, e.g., bowls, pyramids, and even custom ergonomic surfaces
like mouse covers. Critically, the transformation is driven by a
low-information stimulus (uniform heat) yet produces highly intricate shapes
through programmed geometric design. The morphing behavior, confirmed by finite
element simulations, arises from strain mismatch between the contracting
thermoplastic layer and the constraining Kirigami layer. By decoupling material
composition from mechanical response, this method avoids detailed process
control and enables a broad class of self-morphing structures, offering a
versatile platform for adaptive design and scalable manufacturing.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly playing key roles as support platforms for
human operators in high-risk, dangerous applications. To accomplish challenging
tasks, an efficient human-robot cooperation and understanding is required.
While typically robotic planning leverages 3D geometric information, human
operators are accustomed to a high-level compact representation of the
environment, like top-down 2D maps representing the Building Information Model
(BIM). 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool to bridge the gap
between human readable 2D BIM and the robot 3D maps. In this work, we introduce
Pixels-to-Graph (Pix2G), a novel lightweight method to generate structured
scene graphs from image pixels and LiDAR maps in real-time for the autonomous
exploration of unknown environments on resource-constrained robot platforms. To
satisfy onboard compute constraints, the framework is designed to perform all
operation on CPU only. The method output are a de-noised 2D top-down
environment map and a structure-segmented 3D pointcloud which are seamlessly
connected using a multi-layer graph abstracting information from object-level
up to the building-level. The proposed method is quantitatively and
qualitatively evaluated during real-world experiments performed using the NASA
JPL NeBula-Spot legged robot to autonomously explore and map cluttered garage

Abstract: Robust and adaptive robotic peg-in-hole assembly under tight tolerances is
critical to various industrial applications. However, it remains an open
challenge due to perceptual and physical uncertainties from contact-rich
interactions that easily exceed the allowed clearance. In this paper, we study
how to leverage contact between the peg and its matching hole to eliminate
uncertainties in the assembly process under unstructured settings. By examining
the role of compliance under contact constraints, we present a manipulation
system that plans collision-inclusive interactions for the peg to 1)
iteratively identify its task environment to localize the target hole and 2)
exploit environmental contact constraints to refine insertion motions into the
target hole without relying on precise perception, enabling a robust solution
to peg-in-hole assembly. By conceptualizing the above process as the
composition of funneling in different state spaces, we present a formal
approach to constructing manipulation funnels as an uncertainty-absorbing
paradigm for peg-in-hole assembly. The proposed system effectively generalizes
across diverse peg-in-hole scenarios across varying scales, shapes, and
materials in a learning-free manner. Extensive experiments on a NIST Assembly
Task Board (ATB) and additional challenging scenarios validate its robustness
in real-world applications.

Abstract: Garment manipulation is a significant challenge for robots due to the complex
dynamics and potential self-occlusion of garments. Most existing methods of
efficient garment unfolding overlook the crucial role of standardization of
flattened garments, which could significantly simplify downstream tasks like
folding, ironing, and packing. This paper presents APS-Net, a novel approach to
garment manipulation that combines unfolding and standardization in a unified
framework. APS-Net employs a dual-arm, multi-primitive policy with dynamic
fling to quickly unfold crumpled garments and pick-and-place (p and p) for
precise alignment. The purpose of garment standardization during unfolding
involves not only maximizing surface coverage but also aligning the garment's
shape and orientation to predefined requirements. To guide effective robot
learning, we introduce a novel factorized reward function for standardization,
which incorporates garment coverage (Cov), keypoint distance (KD), and
intersection-over-union (IoU) metrics. Additionally, we introduce a spatial
action mask and an Action Optimized Module to improve unfolding efficiency by
selecting actions and operation points effectively. In simulation, APS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for long sleeves, achieving 3.9 percent
better coverage, 5.2 percent higher IoU, and a 0.14 decrease in KD (7.09
percent relative reduction). Real-world folding tasks further demonstrate that
standardization simplifies the folding process. Project page: see

Conclusion: SPI-BoTER方法结合物理可解释性与数据适应性，为工业机器人高精度控制提供了有效解决方案，在智能制造中具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: The widespread application of industrial robots in fields such as cutting and
welding has imposed increasingly stringent requirements on the trajectory
accuracy of end-effectors. However, current error compensation methods face
several critical challenges, including overly simplified mechanism modeling, a
lack of physical consistency in data-driven approaches, and substantial data
requirements. These issues make it difficult to achieve both high accuracy and
strong generalization simultaneously. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a Spatial-Physical Informed Attention Residual Network (SPI-BoTER).
This method integrates the kinematic equations of the robotic manipulator with
a Transformer architecture enhanced by sparse self-attention masks. A
parameter-adaptive hybrid loss function incorporating spatial and physical
information is employed to iteratively optimize the network during training,
enabling high-precision error compensation under small-sample conditions.
Additionally, inverse joint angle compensation is performed using a gradient
descent-based optimization method. Experimental results on a small-sample
dataset from a UR5 robotic arm (724 samples, with a train:test:validation split
of 8:1:1) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. It
achieves a 3D absolute positioning error of 0.2515 mm with a standard deviation
of 0.15 mm, representing a 35.16\% reduction in error compared to conventional
deep neural network (DNN) methods. Furthermore, the inverse angle compensation
algorithm converges to an accuracy of 0.01 mm within an average of 147
iterations. This study presents a solution that combines physical
interpretability with data adaptability for high-precision control of
industrial robots, offering promising potential for the reliable execution of
precision tasks in intelligent manufacturing.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to reliably execute complex multi-step manipulation
tasks is crucial for their effective deployment in industrial and household
environments. This paper presents a hierarchical planning and control framework
designed to achieve reliable multi-step humanoid manipulation. The proposed
system comprises three layers: (1) a low-level RL-based controller responsible
for tracking whole-body motion targets; (2) a mid-level set of skill policies
trained via imitation learning that produce motion targets for different steps
of a task; and (3) a high-level vision-language planning module that determines
which skills should be executed and also monitors their completion in real-time
using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). Experimental validation is
performed on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot executing a non-prehensile
pick-and-place task. Over 40 real-world trials, the hierarchical system
achieved a 72.5% success rate in completing the full manipulation sequence.
These experiments confirm the feasibility of the proposed hierarchical system,
highlighting the benefits of VLM-based skill planning and monitoring for
multi-step manipulation scenarios. See https://vlp-humanoid.github.io/ for

Abstract: Autonomous drifting is a complex and crucial maneuver for safety-critical
scenarios like slippery roads and emergency collision avoidance, requiring
precise motion planning and control. Traditional motion planning methods often
struggle with the high instability and unpredictability of drifting,
particularly when operating at high speeds. Recent learning-based approaches
have attempted to tackle this issue but often rely on expert knowledge or have
limited exploration capabilities. Additionally, they do not effectively address
safety concerns during learning and deployment. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based motion planner for
autonomous drifting. Our approach integrates an RL agent with model-based drift
dynamics to determine desired drift motion states, while incorporating a
Predictive Safety Filter (PSF) that adjusts the agent's actions online to
prevent unsafe states. This ensures safe and efficient learning, and stable
drift operation. We validate the effectiveness of our method through
simulations on a Matlab-Carsim platform, demonstrating significant improvements
in drift performance, reduced tracking errors, and computational efficiency
compared to traditional methods. This strategy promises to extend the
capabilities of autonomous vehicles in safety-critical maneuvers.

Abstract: The problem of multi-robot coverage control becomes significantly challenging
when multiple robots leave the mission space simultaneously to charge their
batteries, disrupting the underlying network topology for communication and
sensing. To address this, we propose a resilient network design and control
approach that allows robots to achieve the desired coverage performance while
satisfying energy constraints and maintaining network connectivity throughout
the mission. We model the combined motion, energy, and network dynamics of the
multirobot systems (MRS) as a hybrid system with three modes, i.e., coverage,
return-to-base, and recharge, respectively. We show that ensuring the energy
constraints can be transformed into designing appropriate guard conditions for
mode transition between each of the three modes. Additionally, we present a
systematic procedure to design, maintain, and reconfigure the underlying
network topology using an energy-aware bearing rigid network design, enhancing
the structural resilience of the MRS even when a subset of robots departs to
charge their batteries. Finally, we validate our proposed method using
numerical simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索高纬度月球区域对机器人视觉环境提出了极高挑战，需要模拟低太阳高度角和动态阴影的条件。

Method: 在LunaLab室内测试设施中，使用多种传感器（包括新型SPAD相机）记录机器人导航数据，模拟不同光照条件下的月球环境。

Result: 生成了包含88个序列、130万张图像的数据集，涵盖静态和动态场景，为未来月球任务提供验证资源。

Conclusion: 该数据集为高纬度月球任务和感知退化环境下的机器人操作提供了宝贵的验证工具。

Abstract: Exploring high-latitude lunar regions presents an extremely challenging
visual environment for robots. The low sunlight elevation angle and minimal
light scattering result in a visual field dominated by a high dynamic range
featuring long, dynamic shadows. Reproducing these conditions on Earth requires
sophisticated simulators and specialized facilities. We introduce a unique
dataset recorded at the LunaLab from the SnT - University of Luxembourg, an
indoor test facility designed to replicate the optical characteristics of
multiple lunar latitudes. Our dataset includes images, inertial measurements,
and wheel odometry data from robots navigating seven distinct trajectories
under multiple illumination scenarios, simulating high-latitude lunar
conditions from dawn to night time with and without the aid of headlights,
resulting in 88 distinct sequences containing a total of 1.3M images. Data was
captured using a stereo RGB-inertial sensor, a monocular monochrome camera, and
for the first time, a novel single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) camera. We
recorded both static and dynamic image sequences, with robots navigating at
slow (5 cm/s) and fast (50 cm/s) speeds. All data is calibrated, synchronized,
and timestamped, providing a valuable resource for validating perception tasks
from vision-based autonomous navigation to scientific imaging for future lunar
missions targeting high-latitude regions or those intended for robots operating
across perceptually degraded environments. The dataset can be downloaded from

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在复杂开放环境中需要安全决策，现有强化学习方法在复杂任务中缺乏通用性和效率。

Method: SAD-RL框架结合分层强化学习（HRL）和场景化环境，高层策略选择动作模板，低层逻辑执行。

Result: 实验表明，SAD-RL训练的智能体能在简单和挑战性场景中高效实现安全行为。

Conclusion: 分层策略和场景多样性是提升自动驾驶决策算法性能的关键。

Abstract: Developing decision-making algorithms for highly automated driving systems
remains challenging, since these systems have to operate safely in an open and
complex environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches can learn
comprehensive decision policies directly from experience and already show
promising results in simple driving tasks. However, current approaches fail to
achieve generalizability for more complex driving tasks and lack learning
efficiency. Therefore, we present Scenario-based Automated Driving
Reinforcement Learning (SAD-RL), the first framework that integrates
Reinforcement Learning (RL) of hierarchical policy in a scenario-based
environment. A high-level policy selects maneuver templates that are evaluated
and executed by a low-level control logic. The scenario-based environment
allows to control the training experience for the agent and to explicitly
introduce challenging, but rate situations into the training process. Our
experiments show that an agent trained using the SAD-RL framework can achieve
safe behaviour in easy as well as challenging situations efficiently. Our
ablation studies confirmed that both HRL and scenario diversity are essential
for achieving these results.

Result: 在三个公开基准测试中，Voxel-ESVIO在精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Voxel-ESVIO通过体素地图管理有效解决了事件相机噪声问题，显著提升了视觉惯性里程计的性能。

Abstract: The event camera, renowned for its high dynamic range and exceptional
temporal resolution, is recognized as an important sensor for visual odometry.
However, the inherent noise in event streams complicates the selection of
high-quality map points, which critically determine the precision of state
estimation. To address this challenge, we propose Voxel-ESVIO, an event-based
stereo visual-inertial odometry system that utilizes voxel map management,
which efficiently filter out high-quality 3D points. Specifically, our
methodology utilizes voxel-based point selection and voxel-aware point
management to collectively optimize the selection and updating of map points on
a per-voxel basis. These synergistic strategies enable the efficient retrieval
of noise-resilient map points with the highest observation likelihood in
current frames, thereby ensureing the state estimation accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our Voxel-ESVIO
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in quadruped robot research have significantly improved
their ability to traverse complex and unstructured outdoor environments.
However, the issue of noise generated during locomotion is generally
overlooked, which is critically important in noise-sensitive indoor
environments, such as service and healthcare settings, where maintaining low

generated by quadruped robots during locomotion through the development of
advanced motion control algorithms. To achieve this, we propose a novel
approach that minimizes noise emissions by integrating optimized gait design
with tailored control strategies. This method achieves an average noise
reduction of approximately 8 dBA during movement, thereby enhancing the
suitability of quadruped robots for deployment in noise-sensitive indoor
environments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach across various indoor settings, highlighting the potential of
quadruped robots for quiet operation in noise-sensitive environments.

Conclusion: A2CF通过自适应辅助力显著加速高维机器人控制中的复杂技能学习，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Learning policies for complex humanoid tasks remains both challenging and
compelling. Inspired by how infants and athletes rely on external support--such
as parental walkers or coach-applied guidance--to acquire skills like walking,
dancing, and performing acrobatic flips, we propose A2CF: Adaptive Assistive
Curriculum Force for humanoid motion learning. A2CF trains a dual-agent system,
in which a dedicated assistive force agent applies state-dependent forces to
guide the robot through difficult initial motions and gradually reduces
assistance as the robot's proficiency improves. Across three
benchmarks--bipedal walking, choreographed dancing, and backflip--A2CF achieves
convergence 30% faster than baseline methods, lowers failure rates by over 40%,
and ultimately produces robust, support-free policies. Real-world experiments
further demonstrate that adaptively applied assistive forces significantly
accelerate the acquisition of complex skills in high-dimensional robotic
control.

Abstract: 3D world models (i.e., learning-based 3D dynamics models) offer a promising
approach to generalizable robotic manipulation by capturing the underlying
physics of environment evolution conditioned on robot actions. However,
existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics
using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require
time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for
training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point
cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss,
supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material,
multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained
multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials,
trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate
scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene
forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics
learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction
scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world
experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving
superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream
visuomotor tasks. Experimental videos are available at

Abstract: Collision-free optimal formation control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
teams is challenging. The state-of-the-art optimal control approaches often
rely on numerical methods sensitive to initial guesses. This paper presents an
innovative collision-free finite-time formation control scheme for multiple
UAVs leveraging the differential flatness of the UAV dynamics, eliminating the
need for numerical methods. We formulate a finite-time optimal control problem
to plan a formation trajectory for feasible initial states. This formation
trajectory planning optimal control problem involves a collective performance
index to meet the formation requirements of achieving relative positions and
velocity consensus. It is solved by applying Pontryagin's principle.
Subsequently, a collision-constrained regulating problem is addressed to ensure
collision-free tracking of the planned formation trajectory. The tracking
problem incorporates a directionally aware collision avoidance strategy that
prioritizes avoiding UAVs in the forward path and relative approach. It assigns
lower priority to those on the sides with an oblique relative approach and
disregards UAVs behind and not in the relative approach. The simulation results
for a four-UAV team (re)formation problem confirm the efficacy of the proposed
control scheme.

Abstract: Handover between a human and a dexterous robotic hand is a fundamental yet
challenging task in human-robot collaboration. It requires handling dynamic
environments and a wide variety of objects and demands robust and adaptive
grasping strategies. However, progress in developing effective dynamic
dexterous grasping methods is limited by the absence of high-quality,
real-world human-to-robot handover datasets. Existing datasets primarily focus
on grasping static objects or rely on synthesized handover motions, which
differ significantly from real-world robot motion patterns, creating a
substantial gap in applicability. In this paper, we introduce DexH2R, a
comprehensive real-world dataset for human-to-robot handovers, built on a
dexterous robotic hand. Our dataset captures a diverse range of interactive
objects, dynamic motion patterns, rich visual sensor data, and detailed
annotations. Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions,
we utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to
align with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for
intelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution,
DynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art
approaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods,
providing a thorough comparison and analysis. We believe our benchmark will
drive advancements in human-to-robot handover research by offering a
high-quality dataset, effective solutions, and comprehensive evaluation
metrics.

Result: 模式崩溃确实存在，模型在交互事件前仍可能无法预测正确模式。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于开发更一致、准确的预测模型，提升自动驾驶安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle decisions rely on multimodal prediction models that
account for multiple route options and the inherent uncertainty in human
behavior. However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most
likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing
methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often
overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally,
traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and
do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none
of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we
propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint
trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce
metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the
sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory
prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When
looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves
closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable
to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode
becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new
insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction
models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: InfGen是一个高保真度的自动驾驶模拟环境，适用于训练和评估自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Realistic and interactive traffic simulation is essential for training and
evaluating autonomous driving systems. However, most existing data-driven
simulation methods rely on static initialization or log-replay data, limiting
their ability to model dynamic, long-horizon scenarios with evolving agent
populations. We propose InfGen, a scenario generation framework that outputs
agent states and trajectories in an autoregressive manner. InfGen represents
the entire scene as a sequence of tokens, including traffic light signals,
agent states, and motion vectors, and uses a transformer model to simulate
traffic over time. This design enables InfGen to continuously insert new agents
into traffic, supporting infinite scene generation. Experiments demonstrate
that InfGen produces realistic, diverse, and adaptive traffic behaviors.
Furthermore, reinforcement learning policies trained in InfGen-generated
scenarios achieve superior robustness and generalization, validating its
utility as a high-fidelity simulation environment for autonomous driving. More

Abstract: Efficient identification of picking points is critical for automated fruit
harvesting. Avocados present unique challenges owing to their irregular shape,
weight, and less-structured growing environments, which require specific
viewpoints for successful harvesting. We propose a geometry-based,
semantics-aware viewpoint-planning algorithm to address these challenges. The
planning process involves three key steps: viewpoint sampling, evaluation, and
execution. Starting from a partially occluded view, the system first detects
the fruit, then leverages geometric information to constrain the viewpoint
search space to a 1D circle, and uniformly samples four points to balance the

Motivation: 传统增材制造系统受限于静态设置和人工依赖，导致生产周期长且扩展性有限。移动机器人可以提升生产灵活性，但现有系统在打印质量和精度方面存在不足。

Method: 通过集成增材制造系统与移动机器人，采用模型预测控制框架，优化动态环境中的导航和打印质量。

Conclusion: 该框架为动态环境中的高精度增材制造提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for customized, on-demand production has grown in
the manufacturing sector. Additive Manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a
promising technology to enhance customization capabilities, enabling greater
flexibility, reduced lead times, and more efficient material usage. However,
traditional AM systems remain constrained by static setups and human worker
dependencies, resulting in long lead times and limited scalability. Mobile
robots can improve the flexibility of production systems by transporting
products to designated locations in a dynamic environment. By integrating AM
systems with mobile robots, manufacturers can optimize travel time for
preparatory tasks and distributed printing operations. Mobile AM robots have
been deployed for on-site production of large-scale structures, but often
neglect critical print quality metrics like surface roughness. Additionally,
these systems do not have the precision necessary for producing small,
intricate components. We propose a model predictive control framework for a
mobile AM platform that ensures safe navigation on the plant floor while
maintaining high print quality in a dynamic environment. Three case studies are
used to test the feasibility and reliability of the proposed systems.

Abstract: Improving automated vehicle software requires driving data rich in valuable
road user interactions. In this paper, we propose a risk-based filtering
approach that helps identify such valuable driving situations from large
datasets. Specifically, we use a probabilistic risk model to detect high-risk
situations. Our method stands out by considering a) first-order situations
(where one vehicle directly influences another and induces risk) and b)
second-order situations (where influence propagates through an intermediary
vehicle). In experiments, we show that our approach effectively selects
valuable driving situations in the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Compared to the
two baseline interaction metrics of Kalman difficulty and Tracks-To-Predict
(TTP), our filtering approach identifies complex and complementary situations,
enriching the quality in automated vehicle testing. The risk data is made

Result: MGPRL在定位精度和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MGPRL是一种无需预校准的高效定位方案，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems
operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot
relative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like
cameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high
computational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint
environments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel
distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull
of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ
co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware
multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based
alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI
field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are
utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative
localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations
with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with
limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi
RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or
offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed
MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,
comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase
that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and
computational efficiency. Finally, we open source MGPRL as a ROS package

Conclusion: 该系统能显著提升复杂现实场景中的机器人护送服务。

Abstract: The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen
significant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However,
most current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,
assuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded
environments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to
keep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As
a result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective
escorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement
dynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must
continuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process
and adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing
dataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of
escorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where
other individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to
identify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting
their actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification
and action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network
architecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust
its speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume
escorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong
baselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness,
showcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in
complex, real-world scenarios.

Method: 提出了一种基于邻近图的通道检测和自由空间分解方法，并开发了采样算法用于快速通道遍历检查。

Result: PTOPP在配置性、解的最优性和效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PTOPP为自由空间优化提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于广泛的路径规划问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new paradigm of optimal path planning, i.e.,
passage-traversing optimal path planning (PTOPP), that optimizes paths'
traversed passages for specified optimization objectives. In particular, PTOPP
is utilized to find the path with optimal accessible free space along its
entire length, which represents a basic requirement for paths in robotics. As
passages are places where free space shrinks and becomes constrained, the core
idea is to leverage the path's passage traversal status to characterize its
accessible free space comprehensively. To this end, a novel passage detection
and free space decomposition method using proximity graphs is proposed,
enabling fast detection of sparse but informative passages and environment
decompositions. Based on this preprocessing, optimal path planning with
accessible free space objectives or constraints is formulated as PTOPP problems
compatible with sampling-based optimal planners. Then, sampling-based
algorithms for PTOPP, including their dependent primitive procedures, are
developed leveraging partitioned environments for fast passage traversal check.
All these methods are implemented and thoroughly tested for effectiveness and
efficiency validation. Compared to existing approaches, such as clearance-based
methods, PTOPP demonstrates significant advantages in configurability, solution
optimality, and efficiency, addressing prior limitations and incapabilities. It
is believed to provide an efficient and versatile solution to accessible free
space optimization over conventional avenues and more generally, to a broad
class of path planning problems that can be formulated as PTOPP.

Abstract: Automated inspection with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) is a transformative
capability set to revolutionize various application domains. However, this task
is inherently complex, as it demands the seamless integration of perception,
planning, and control which existing approaches often treat separately.
Moreover, it requires accurate long-horizon planning to predict action
sequences, in contrast to many current techniques, which tend to be myopic. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D inspection approach that unifies
perception, planning, and control within a single data-driven predictive
control framework. Unlike traditional methods that rely on known UAS dynamic
models, our approach requires only input-output data, making it easily
applicable to off-the-shelf black-box UASs. Our method incorporates back-face
elimination, a visibility determination technique from 3D computer graphics,
directly into the control loop, thereby enabling the online generation of
accurate, long-horizon 3D inspection trajectories.

Abstract: The adoption of mobile robotic platforms in complex environments, such as
agricultural settings, requires these systems to exhibit a flexible yet
effective architecture that integrates perception and control. In such
scenarios, several tasks need to be accomplished simultaneously, ranging from
managing robot limits to performing operational tasks and handling human
inputs. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive control
architecture for achieving complex tasks such as robotized harvesting in
vineyards within the framework of the European project CANOPIES. In detail, a
16-DOF dual-arm mobile robot is employed, controlled via a Hierarchical
Quadratic Programming (HQP) approach capable of handling both equality and
inequality constraints at various priorities to harvest grape bunches selected
by the perception system developed within the project. Furthermore, given the
complexity of the scenario and the uncertainty in the perception system, which
could potentially lead to collisions with the environment, the handling of
interaction forces is necessary. Remarkably, this was achieved using the same
HQP framework. This feature is further leveraged to enable semi-autonomous
operations, allowing a human operator to assist the robotic counterpart in
completing harvesting tasks. Finally, the obtained results are validated
through extensive testing conducted first in a laboratory environment to prove
individual functionalities, then in a real vineyard, encompassing both
autonomous and semi-autonomous grape harvesting operations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PAC Bench是一个新基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在物理属性、动作可行性和约束方面的理解能力，揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLMs在机器人操作任务中广泛应用，但其对低层物理前提的理解能力尚未验证，影响任务可靠性。

Method: 提出PAC Bench，包含多样化的数据集和任务，用于系统评估VLMs的物理理解能力。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs在物理概念理解上存在显著不足，不适合可靠机器人操作。

Conclusion: PAC Bench为VLM物理推理评估提供了标准化基准，并指导开发更鲁棒的模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly pivotal for generalist robot
manipulation, enabling tasks such as physical reasoning, policy generation, and
failure detection. However, their proficiency in these high-level applications
often assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a
capability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions
reliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,
weight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical
constraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being
closed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue
that off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded
understanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of
core Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability
perspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,
comprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1
to 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,
and 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.
  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to
grasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their
suitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for
targeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for
rigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of
more robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.

Conclusion: 研究为优化基于AI的车辆感知测试方法及改进CP环境中自动驾驶与VRUs的交互模型提供了依据。

Abstract: Ensuring safe and realistic interactions between automated driving systems
and vulnerable road users (VRUs) in urban environments requires advanced
testing methodologies. This paper presents a test environment that combines a
Vehiclein-the-Loop (ViL) test bench with a motion laboratory, demonstrating the
feasibility of cyber-physical (CP) testing of vehicle-pedestrian and
vehicle-cyclist interactions. Building upon previous work focused on pedestrian
localization, we further validate a human pose estimation (HPE) approach
through a comparative analysis of real-world (RW) and virtual representations
of VRUs. The study examines the perception of full-body motion using a
commercial monocular camera-based 3Dskeletal detection AI. The virtual scene is
generated in Unreal Engine 5, where VRUs are animated in real time and
projected onto a screen to stimulate the camera. The proposed stimulation
technique ensures the correct perspective, enabling realistic vehicle
perception. To assess the accuracy and consistency of HPE across RW and CP
domains, we analyze the reliability of detections as well as variations in
movement trajectories and joint estimation stability. The validation includes
dynamic test scenarios where human avatars, both walking and cycling, are
monitored under controlled conditions. Our results show a strong alignment in
HPE between RW and CP test conditions for stable motion patterns, while notable
inaccuracies persist under dynamic movements and occlusions, particularly for
complex cyclist postures. These findings contribute to refining CP testing
approaches for evaluating next-generation AI-based vehicle perception and to
enhancing interaction models of automated vehicles and VRUs in CP environments.

Conclusion: 多时间尺度分层强化学习方法有效解决了驾驶行为波动和优化问题，提升了驾驶效率和安全性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly used in autonomous driving (AD)
and shows clear advantages. However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy
structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle
control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in
network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals
cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore,
we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our
approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL
policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and
short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is
explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving
behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state
updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure
multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based
highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly
improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action
consistency and safety.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了本体感觉偏移问题，提升了模仿学习的性能。

Abstract: Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal
inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While
proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle
avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising
degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the
underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions
of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment.
To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that
bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using
Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout
proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of
states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances
robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and
deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate
the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage
proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms
the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed
to address distributional shifts.

Abstract: The safe trajectory planning of intelligent and connected vehicles is a key
component in autonomous driving technology. Modeling the environment risk
information by field is a promising and effective approach for safe trajectory
planning. However, existing risk assessment theories only analyze the risk by
current information, ignoring future prediction. This paper proposes a
predictive risk analysis and safe trajectory planning framework for intelligent
and connected vehicles. This framework first predicts future trajectories of
objects by a local risk-aware algorithm, following with a
spatiotemporal-discretised predictive risk analysis using the prediction
results. Then the safe trajectory is generated based on the predictive risk
analysis. Finally, simulation and vehicle experiments confirm the efficacy and
real-time practicability of our approach.

Abstract: New endoscopists require a large volume of expert-proctored colonoscopies to
attain minimal competency. Developing multi-fingered, synchronized control of a
colonoscope requires significant time and exposure to the device. Current
training methods inhibit this development by relying on tool hand-off for
expert demonstrations. There is a need for colonoscopy training tools that
enable in-hand expert guidance in real-time. We present a new concept of a
tandem training system that uses a telemanipulated preceptor colonoscope to
guide novice users as they perform a colonoscopy. This system is capable of
dual-control and can automatically toggle between expert and novice control of
a standard colonoscope's angulation control wheels. Preliminary results from a
user study with novice and expert users show the effectiveness of this device
as a skill acquisition tool. We believe that this device has the potential to
accelerate skill acquisition for colonoscopy and, in the future, enable
individualized instruction and responsive teaching through bidirectional
actuation.

### [547] [A Multi-Criteria Evaluation Framework for Siting Fusion Energy Facilities: Application and Evaluation of U.S. Coal Power Plants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22489)
*Muhammad R. Abdussami,Kevin Daley,Gabrielle Hoelzle,Aditi Verma*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种综合选址方法，结合专家判断、地理空间数据和多准则决策工具，系统评估聚变能源设施的选址适宜性。以美国现有燃煤电厂为例，应用该框架评估其未来作为聚变设施的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着燃煤电厂寿命结束，其场地可能成为聚变能源设施的潜在选址，研究旨在提供一种透明且可扩展的决策支持工具。

Method: 采用22项选址标准，结合模糊完全一致性方法（F-FUCOM）确定权重，加权求和法（WSM）进行场地排序。

Result: 通过案例研究，展示了该框架在评估燃煤电厂场地作为聚变设施选址的适用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为聚变能源设施的选址提供了系统化、透明的决策支持工具。

Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for siting fusion energy
facilities, integrating expert judgment, geospatial data, and multi-criteria
decision making tools to evaluate site suitability systematically. As a case
study, we apply this framework to all currently operational coal power plant
sites in the United States to examine their potential for hosting future fusion
facilities at a time when these coal plants are shut down on reaching their end
of life - timelines which are expected to coincide with the potential
deployment of fusion energy facilities. Drawing on 22 siting criteria -
including state and federal policies, risk and hazard assessments, and spatial
and infrastructural parameters - we implement two MultiCriteria Decision-Making
(MCDM) methods: the Fuzzy Full Consistency Method (F-FUCOM) to derive attribute
weights and the Weighted Sum Method (WSM) to rank sites based on composite
suitability scores. By focusing on fusion-specific siting needs and
demonstrating the framework through a coal site application, this study
contributes a scalable and transparent decision-support tool for identifying
optimal fusion energy deployment locations.

*Armin Abdolmohammadi,Navid Mojahed,Shima Nazari,Bahram Ravani*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据高效框架的挖掘力预测方法，通过校准土壤参数实现自适应控制。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要大量数据或模拟，限制了可扩展性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在线和可扩展的高效路径规划潜力。

Abstract: Accurate excavation force prediction is essential for enabling autonomous
operation and optimizing control strategies in earthmoving machinery.
Conventional methods typically require extensive data collection or simulations
across diverse soil types, limiting scalability and adaptability. This paper
proposes a data-efficient framework that calibrates soil parameters using force
data from the prior bucket-loading cycle. Leveraging an analytical soil-tool
interaction model, the fundamental earthmoving equation (FEE), our approach
uses a multi-stage optimization strategy, on soil parameters during the loading
phase. These fitted parameters are then used to predict excavation forces in
the upcoming digging cycle, allowing the system to adapt its control inputs
without the need for extensive data collection or machine learning-based model
training. The framework is validated in high-fidelity simulations using the
Algoryx Dynamics engine, across multiple soil types and excavation
trajectories, demonstrating accurate force predictions with root-mean-square
errors of 10\% to 15\% in primary test cases. This cycle-to-cycle adaptation
strategy showcases the potential for online and scalable efficient path
planning for wheel loader operations.

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代无线网络的实时共存优化提供了可扩展和自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and fair coexistence in unlicensed spectrum is essential to support
heterogeneous networks such as 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi, which often contend for
shared wireless resources. We introduce a general framework for wireless
Coexistence Parameter Management (CPM) based on state-augmented constrained
reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm, QaSAL-CPM, which
incorporates state-augmentation by embedding the dual variables in the
constrained optimization formulation directly into the agent's observation
space. This method enables the agent to respond to constraint violations in
real time while continuing to optimize a primary performance objective. Through
extensive simulations of 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence scenarios, we show that
QaSAL-CPM achieves reliable QoS compliance and improved policy robustness
across various transmitter densities compared to previous approaches. The
proposed framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution for real-time
coexistence optimization in next-generation wireless networks.

### [550] [A Correlation-Based Design of RIS for Reduced Power Consumption and Simplified Control Circuitry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22702)
*Zina Mohamed,Ammar B. Kouki,Sonia Aïssa*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于相关性的新型RIS设计（Connected-RIS），通过共享控制信号简化硬件结构并降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化无线通信中的硬件结构和降低能耗，特别是在可重构智能表面（RIS）的应用中。

Method: 通过分析表面元素相位偏移值的相关性，设计Connected-RIS，共享控制信号，减少负载阻抗和控制信号数量。

Result: 显著降低功耗（86-92%）和控制信号数量（83-98%），同时保持足够的通信性能。

Conclusion: Connected-RIS设计在降低硬件成本和能耗方面具有显著优势，适用于无线通信系统。

Abstract: Aiming at simplifying the hardware structure and reducing the energy
consumption in wireless communication via reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RIS), this paper introduces a novel RIS design founded on the correlation
between the phase shift values of the surface elements. First, a correlation
analysis is conducted, considering the azimuth angle of a target device within
a coverage region spanning from $-80^{\circ}$ to $80^{\circ}$. The correlation
is demonstrated for different deployment cases, creating the basis for the new
RIS structure, termed Connected-RIS, where correlated elements are designed to
share the same control signal. The fundamental performance of the proposed
design is then analyzed in terms of control signals, power consumption, and
communication system performance, comparing it to two RIS structures with full
control: one with the same size as the proposed design, and the other employing
the minimum number of elements necessary to satisfy the fair coverage
criterion. The correlation-based RIS design enables three-dimensional passive
beamforming and significantly reduces the number of required load impedances
and control signals, thereby lowering the hardware cost and simplifying the
control circuitry. It also achieves substantial power savings as compared to
the baseline schemes, while maintaining sufficient gain for a fair radio
coverage. For instance, numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed
design reduces the power consumption by almost 86-92\% and the control signals
by 83-98\% compared to operation with fully controlled RIS.

Conclusion: X-pSRAM为下一代光学计算在密码学、超维计算和神经网络等领域的应用提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Traditional von Neumann architectures suffer from fundamental bottlenecks due
to continuous data movement between memory and processing units, a challenge
that worsens with technology scaling as electrical interconnect delays become
more significant. These limitations impede the performance and energy
efficiency required for modern data-intensive applications. In contrast,
photonic in-memory computing presents a promising alternative by harnessing the
advantages of light, enabling ultra-fast data propagation without
length-dependent impedance, thereby significantly reducing computational
latency and energy consumption. This work proposes a novel differential
photonic static random access memory (pSRAM) bitcell that facilitates
electro-optic data storage while enabling ultra-fast in-memory Boolean XOR
computation. By employing cross-coupled microring resonators and differential
photodiodes, the XOR-augmented pSRAM (X-pSRAM) bitcell achieves at least 10 GHz
read, write, and compute operations entirely in the optical domain.
Additionally, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) enables n-bit XOR
computation in a single-shot operation, supporting massively parallel
processing and enhanced computational efficiency. Validated on GlobalFoundries'
45SPCLO node, the X-pSRAM consumed 13.2 fJ energy per bit for XOR computation,
representing a significant advancement toward next-generation optical computing
with applications in cryptography, hyperdimensional computing, and neural
networks.

Abstract: With the increasing availability of streaming data in dynamic systems, a
critical challenge in data-driven modeling for control is how to efficiently
select informative data to characterize system dynamics. In this work, we
design an online coreset selection method under the framework of set-membership
identification for systems subject to process disturbances, with the objective
of improving data efficiency while ensuring convergence guarantees.
Specifically, we first propose a stacked polyhedral representation that
over-approximates the feasible set of system parameters. Leveraging a
generalized Gr\"unbaum's inequality, we design a geometric selection criterion
for constructing the coreset. To reduce computational complexity, an online
double-description-based constraint reduction method is introduced to simplify
the polyhedral representation. Finally, we analyze the convergence of the
feasible set with respect to the coreset and derive upper bounds on the
selection probability and the expected number of data in the coreset. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through comprehensive
simulation studies.

### [553] [Momentum-based Accelerated Algorithm for Distributed Optimization under Sector-Bound Nonlinearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22855)
*Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian,Hamid R. Rabiee*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于加速共识的分布式优化算法，结合梯度追踪技术，适用于局部非凸优化问题。通过引入动量（heavy-ball方法）和权重平衡网络设计，提高了收敛速度并处理了网络中的非线性问题。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式优化在并行和去中心化学习中具有优势，但现有方法在局部非凸优化和动态网络环境下表现不足。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种结合梯度追踪和动量加速的算法，并采用权重平衡网络设计，通过扰动理论和特征谱分析证明其收敛性。

Result: 算法在存在非线性映射和局部非凸成本函数的情况下仍能收敛，适用于动态有向网络。

Conclusion: 该算法在分布式优化中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于实际应用中的动态网络环境。

Abstract: Distributed optimization advances centralized machine learning methods by
enabling parallel and decentralized learning processes over a network of
computing nodes. This work provides an accelerated consensus-based distributed
algorithm for locally non-convex optimization using the gradient-tracking
technique. The proposed algorithm (i) improves the convergence rate by adding
momentum towards the optimal state using the heavy-ball method, while (ii)
addressing general sector-bound nonlinearities over the information-sharing
network. The link nonlinearity includes any sign-preserving odd sector-bound
mapping, for example, log-scale data quantization or clipping in practical
applications. For admissible momentum and gradient-tracking parameters, using
perturbation theory and eigen-spectrum analysis, we prove convergence even in
the presence of sector-bound nonlinearity and for locally non-convex cost
functions. Further, in contrast to most existing weight-stochastic algorithms,
we adopt weight-balanced (WB) network design. This WB design and
perturbation-based analysis allow to handle dynamic directed network of agents
to address possible time-varying setups due to link failures or packet drops.

*Faizal Hafiz,Amelia Kunze,Enrico Formenti,Davide La Torre*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于概率度量的细胞自动机（CAMs）框架，用于建模具有不确定性的系统，并通过自适应差分进化算法（SaDE）解决局部规则识别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统细胞自动机（CCAs）在建模具有不确定性的系统时存在局限性，因此研究转向概率度量的细胞自动机（CAMs）。

Method: 将局部规则识别问题转化为参数估计问题，并提出基于自适应差分进化（SaDE）的元启发式搜索方法。

Result: 方法在二维CAMs中成功识别了不同邻域类型和半径的局部规则。

Conclusion: CAMs框架和SaDE算法为建模和识别具有不确定性的系统提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Classical Cellular Automata (CCAs) are a powerful computational framework for
modeling global spatio-temporal dynamics with local interactions. While CCAs
have been applied across numerous scientific fields, identifying the local rule
that governs observed dynamics remains a challenging task. Moreover, the
underlying assumption of deterministic cell states often limits the
applicability of CCAs to systems characterized by inherent uncertainty. This
study, therefore, focuses on the identification of Cellular Automata on spaces
of probability measures (CAMs), where cell states are represented by
probability distributions. This framework enables the modeling of systems with
probabilistic uncertainty and spatially varying dynamics. Moreover, we
formulate the local rule identification problem as a parameter estimation
problem and propose a meta-heuristic search based on Self-adaptive Differential
Evolution (SaDE) to estimate local rule parameters accurately from the observed
data. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through local rule
identification in two-dimensional CAMs with varying neighborhood types and
radii.

Conclusion: DRL-PPO方法在微电网运营中表现出高效性和可靠性，尤其适用于偏远地区。

Abstract: This study presents a real-time energy management framework for hybrid
community microgrids integrating photovoltaic, wind, battery energy storage
systems, diesel generators, and grid interconnection. The proposed approach
formulates the dispatch problem as a multi-objective optimization task that
aims to minimize operational costs. Two control strategies are proposed and
evaluated: a conventional rule-based control (RBC) method and an advanced deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) approach utilizing proximal policy optimization
(PPO). A realistic case study based on Australian load and generation profiles
is used to validate the framework. Simulation results demonstrate that DRL-PPO
reduces operational costs by 18%, CO_2 emissions by 20%, and improves system
reliability by 87.5% compared to RBC. Beside, DRL-PPO increases renewable
energy utilization by 13%, effectively reducing dependence on diesel generation
and grid imports. These findings demonstrate the potential of DRL-based
approaches to enable cost-effective and resilient microgrid operations,
particularly in regional and remote communities.

*Kesav Kazam Ramachandran Anantharaman,Rahul Meshram*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两时间尺度的分层分散控制架构，用于网络物理系统的控制，包括全局控制器和局部控制器，分别采用无限和有限时间范围的MDP优化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络物理系统中多时间尺度控制的复杂性问题，提供灵活性和自主性。

Method: 采用分层架构，全局控制器优化无限时间范围MDP，局部控制器采用COpt（无限时间范围）和FOpt（有限时间范围）两种优化框架。

Result: 证明了两种框架下存在确定性最优策略，并研究了它们之间的关系，包括最优值函数差异的界限。

Conclusion: FOpt框架赋予局部控制器更多自主权，且在特定条件下两种框架的最优值相同。

Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture
for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$
independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each
formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating
at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative
reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a
faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the
COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an
infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller
optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure,
where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First,
the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these
frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two
frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two
optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such
that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.

Conclusion: 该方法有效支持高可再生能源电力系统的极端场景分析与应对。

Abstract: Power systems with high renewable energy penetration are highly influenced by
weather conditions, often facing significant challenges such as persistent
power shortages and severe power fluctuations over long time scales. This paper
addresses the critical need for effective characterization of extreme scenarios
under these situations. First, novel risk indices are proposed to quantify the
severity of continuous power shortages and substantial power fluctuations over
long-term operations. These indices are independent of specific scheduling
strategies and incorporate the system's resource regulation capabilities. By
employing a filtering-based approach, the proposed indices focus on retaining
key characteristics of continuous power shortages and fluctuation events,
enabling the identification of extreme scenarios on long time scales. Secondly,
an extreme scenario generation method is developed using Gaussian mixture
models and sequential Monte Carlo simulation. Especially, this method
periodically evaluates the severity of generated scenarios based on the defined
risk indices, retaining extreme scenarios while discarding less critical ones.
Finally, case studies based on real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed method. The results confirm that integrating the identified extreme
scenarios significantly enhances the system's ability to ensure long-term
security and reliability under high renewable energy penetration.

### [558] [Data-driven Implementations of Various Generalizations of Balanced Truncation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23204)
*Umair Zulfiqar*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种非侵入式的ADI框架，用于广义平衡截断方法，仅需原始传递函数的样本即可实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的非侵入式平衡截断方法（如基于正交的方法）虽然理论上可行，但依赖于传递函数谱分解的样本，而实际获取这些样本的方法尚不可行。因此，需要一种仅需原始传递函数样本的实用方法。

Method: 采用非侵入式的ADI框架，仅需原始传递函数的样本，无需访问原始模型的状态空间实现或谱分解样本。

Result: 提出的方法实现了广义平衡截断（如正实平衡截断、有界实平衡截断和平衡随机截断），且仅需原始传递函数的样本。

Conclusion: 该方法为非侵入式广义平衡截断提供了一种实用的实现途径，解决了现有方法依赖谱分解样本的问题。

Abstract: There exist two main frameworks for non-intrusive implementations of
approximate balanced truncation: the quadrature-based framework and the
ADI-based framework. Both approaches rely solely on samples of the transfer
function to construct truncated balanced models, eliminating the need for
access to the original model's state-space realization. Recently, the
quadrature-based framework has been extended to various generalizations of
balanced truncation, including positive-real balanced truncation, bounded-real
balanced truncation, and balanced stochastic truncation. While this extension
is theoretically nonintrusive-meaning it does not require the original
state-space realization-it depends on samples of spectral factorizations of the
transfer function. Since practical methods for obtaining such samples are
currently unavailable, this extension remains largely a theoretical
contribution. In this work, we present a non-intrusive ADI-type framework for
these generalized balanced truncation methods that requires only samples of the
original transfer function for implementation.

*Yuxin Yang,Hang Zhou,Chaojie Li,Xin Li,Yingyi Yan,Mingyang Zheng*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了Z变换与逆拉普拉斯变换（L-1）的关系，指出标准推导中长期忽略的数学问题，并通过完整Bromwich路径修正了结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准推导中因忽略无限弧贡献导致的不一致性问题，尤其是在间断点（如t=0）处。

Method: 通过完整Bromwich路径（包括所有边界贡献）重新评估逆拉普拉斯变换，修正Z变换与L-1的关系。

Result: 修正后的L-1与离散时间傅里叶变换（DTFT）混叠理论一致，为采样数据系统提供了更准确的建模基础。

Conclusion: 需对Z变换、逆拉普拉斯变换及阶跃函数在间断点的行为进行结构性修订，以提升采样数据系统的分析准确性。

Abstract: This paper revisits the classical formulation of the Z-transform and its
relationship to the inverse Laplace transform (L-1), originally developed by
Ragazzini in sampled-data theory. It identifies a longstanding mathematical
oversight in standard derivations, which typically neglect the contribution
from the infinite arc in the complex plane during inverse Laplace evaluation.
This omission leads to inconsistencies, especially at discontinuities such as t
= 0. By incorporating the full Bromwich contour, including all boundary
contributions, we restore internal consistency between L-1 and the Z-transform,
aligning the corrected L-1 with results from Discrete-Time Fourier Transform
(DTFT) aliasing theory. Consequently, this necessitates a structural revision
of the Z-transform, inverse Laplace transform, and the behavior of the
Heaviside step function at discontinuities, providing a more accurate
foundation for modeling and analysis of sampled-data systems.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在优化轨迹和资源分配方面有效，提升了HAPs-SAR系统的实用性和可持续性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the joint optimization of trajectory planning and
resource allocation for a high-altitude platform stations synthetic aperture
radar (HAPs-SAR) system. To support real-time sensing and conserve the limited
energy budget of the HAPs, the proposed framework assumes that the acquired
radar data are transmitted in real time to a ground base station for SAR image
reconstruction. A dynamic trajectory model is developed, and the power
consumption associated with radar sensing, data transmission, and circular
flight is comprehensively analyzed. In addition, solar energy harvesting is
considered to enhance system sustainability. An energy-aware mixed-integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to maximize radar beam
coverage while satisfying operational constraints. To solve this challenging
problem, a sub-optimal successive convex approximation (SCA)-based framework is
proposed, incorporating iterative optimization and finite search. Simulation
results validate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its
effectiveness in balancing SAR performance, communication reliability, and
energy efficiency. A final SAR imaging simulation on a 9-target lattice
scenario further confirms the practical feasibility of the proposed solution.

Conclusion: LLC方案显著提升了直升机部件的寿命延长控制效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a novel life-extending control scheme
for critical helicopter components subjected to significant fatigue loading.
The primary objective is to synthesize a more efficient and less conservative
life-extending control scheme than those currently available in the literature.
The proposed Load Limiting Control (LLC) scheme is a viable solution that
addresses several issues that current life-extending control schemes suffer
from, such as the neglect of fatigue damage induced by the harmonic component
of loads and the inability to distinguish between aggressive and non-aggressive
maneuvers. The proposed LLC scheme treats desired harmonic load limits as limit
boundaries and recasts the problem of load limiting as a vehicle limit by
computing a Control Margin (CM) using a limit detection and avoidance module.
The computed CM is used as a cue to the pilot. The limit detection and
avoidance module comprises an optimization algorithm, a model predictive
controller, and a computationally simple on-board dynamical model. Simulations
were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LLC scheme in limiting
harmonic pitch link loads during flight. One significant outcome is that, with
sufficient training, the pilot can skillfully track the cue within 0.5 seconds
of initiating the tracking task.

Abstract: In contrast to grid-following inverters, Virtual Synchronous Generators
(VSGs) perform well under weak grid conditions but may become unstable when the
grid is strong. Grid strength depends on grid impedance, which unfortunately
varies over time. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive gain-scheduling
control scheme for VSGs. First, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) estimates
the fundamental-frequency grid impedance; then these estimates are fed into an
adaptive gain-scheduling function to recalculate controller parameters under
varying grid conditions. The proposed method is validated in Simulink and
compared with a conventional VSG employing fixed controller gains. The results
demonstrate that settling times and overshoot percentages remain consistent
across different grid conditions. Additionally, previously unseen grid
impedance values are estimated with high accuracy and minimal time delay,
making the approach well suited for real-time gain-scheduling control.

Abstract: The stochastic nature of time delays and sampling intervals in Networked
Control Systems poses significant challenges for controller synthesis and
analysis, often leading to conservative designs and degraded performance. This
work presents a modeling approach for Linear Multiple-Input Multiple-Output
Networked Control Systems and introduces a compensation scheme based on the
Filtered Smith Predictor to mitigate the adverse effects of stochastic time
delays on closed-loop performance. The proposed scheme is evaluated through
numerical simulations of a well-established Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control
system. Results demonstrate that the compensator achieves near-ideal average
closed-loop performance and significantly reduces response variability compared
to a traditional Filtered Smith Predictor. Notably, it yields a 45% reduction
in worst-case tracking error signal energy relative to an ideal baseline system
with no time delays and constant sampling intervals.

Abstract: Load flow analysis is a fundamental technique used by electrical engineers to
simulate and evaluate power system behavior under steady-state conditions. It
enables efficient operation and control by determining how active and reactive
power flows throughout the system. Selecting an appropriate solution method is
critical to ensuring reliable and economical operation of power generation,
transmission, and distribution networks. While the conventional loop method may
be used in small-scale systems, it is limited by its reliance on
impedance-based load data and its inability to scale to complex networks. In
contrast, iterative techniques such as the Gauss-Seidel (GS) and Newton-Raphson
(NR) methods are better suited for analyzing large systems. Of these, the NR
method offers significant advantages due to its quadratic convergence and
improved numerical stability. This study presents a power flow analysis of a
5-bus system using the Newton-Raphson approach. The system was modeled and
simulated in PowerWorld Simulator (PWS), and a custom MATLAB implementation was
developed to verify the results under a base case scenario. The comparative
analysis demonstrates that the NR method provides accurate and robust solutions
for power flow problems, making it well-suited for evaluating system
performance under various operating conditions.

Conclusion: 提出的DRO方法能有效应对气候变化带来的不确定性，为低碳电网规划提供了新思路。

Abstract: Implementing economy-wide decarbonization strategies based on decarbonizing
the power grid via variable renewable energy (VRE) expansion and
electrification of end-uses requires new approaches for energy infrastructure
planning that consider, among other factors, weather-induced uncertainty in
demand and VRE supply. An energy planning model that fails to account for these
uncertainties can hinder the intended transition efforts to a low-carbon grid
and increase the risk of supply shortage especially during extreme weather
conditions. Here, we consider the generation and transmission expansion problem
of joint power-gas infrastructure and operations planning under the uncertainty
of both demand and renewable supply. We propose two distributionally robust
optimization approaches based on moment (MDRO) and Wasserstein distance (WDRO)
ambiguity sets to endogenize these uncertainties and account for the change in
the underlying distribution of these parameters that is caused by the climate
change, among other factors. Furthermore, our model considers the risk-aversion
of the energy planners in the modeling framework via the conditional
value-at-risk (CVaR) metric. An equivalent mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) reformulation of both modeling frameworks is presented, and a
computationally efficient approximation scheme to obtain near-optimal solutions
is proposed. We demonstrate the resulting DRO planning models and solution
strategy via a New England case study under different levels of end-use
electrification and decarbonization targets. Our experiments systematically
explore different modeling aspects and compare the DRO models with stochastic
programming (SP) results.

Conclusion: 提出的双向电力路由器及其切换算法能够在不影响电力系统稳定运行的情况下实现动态功率流管理。

Abstract: To address challenges in improving self-consumption of renewables and
resilience in local residential power systems, the earlier work of the authors
introduced a novel multi-energy management concept, integrating bidirectional
power routing and electricity-hydrogen conversion. This paper focuses on an
experimental verification of the bidirectional power router based on
line-switching, the essential hardware to realize the concept. The primary
contribution is the validation of the router's capability to handle dynamic
change of bidirectional power flow. Furthermore, to achieve bidirectional power
routing without affecting the smooth and stable operation of the power system,
a novel algorithm for router's switching is designed based on power flow
monitoring. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through an
experiment using a setup with a commercially available stationary battery.

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了电力系统可靠性评估的效率和准确性，适用于大规模系统。

Abstract: With a sustainable increase in the scale of power system, the number of
states in the state space grows exponentially, and the reliability assessment
of the power system faces enormous challenges. Traditional state-by-state
assessment methods, such as state enumeration (SE) and Monte Carlo simulation
(MCS) methods, have encountered performance bottlenecks in terms of efficiency
and accuracy. In this paper, the Boolean lattice representation theory of the
state space was studied, and a dichotomy method was proposed to efficiently
partition the state space into some disjoint sub-lattices with a relatively
small number of optimal power flow (OPF) operations. Based on lattice
partition, the reliability indices of the entire space can be calculated
lattice-by-lattice. In addition, alone with the partitioning procedure, the
calculated loss of load probability (LOLP) monotonically increases and rapidly
tends to the analytic value with the designated error bound. Moreover, we
designed a customized Monte Carlo sampling method in lattices of interest to
compute expected energy not supply (EENS). The experiments are conducted on the
RBTS and RTS-79 systems. The results show that the proposed method achieves the
analytic LOLP of the RBTS system after five hundreds of OPF operations, which
is about hundreds of times faster than traditional methods, and the designed
Monte Carlo sampling method converged after thousands of OPF operations on test
systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为时变环境下的数据驱动控制提供了新视角，仿真显示其在最优性和样本效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a sample-efficient, data-driven control framework for
finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) control of linear time-varying (LTV)
systems. In contrast to the time-invariant case, the time-varying LQ problem
involves a differential Riccati equation (DRE) with time-dependent parameters
and terminal boundary constraints. We formulate the LQ problem as a nonconvex
optimization problem and conduct a rigorous analysis of its dual structure. By
exploiting the inherent convexity of the dual problem and analyzing the KKT
conditions, we derive an explicit relationship between the optimal dual
solution and the parameters of the associated Q-function in time-varying case.
This theoretical insight supports the development of a novel, sample-efficient,
non-iterative semidefinite programming (SDP) algorithm that directly computes
the optimal sequence of feedback gains from an ensemble of input-state data
sequences without model identification. The resulting convex, data-dependent
framework provides global optimality guarantees for completely unknown LTV
systems. As a special case, the method also applies to finite-horizon LQ
control of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In this setting, a single
input-state trajectory suffices to identify the optimal LQ feedback policy,
improving significantly over existing Q-learning approaches for finite horizon
LTI systems that typically require data from multiple episodes. The approach
provides a new optimization-based perspective on Q-learning in time-varying
settings and contributes to the broader understanding of data-driven control in
non-stationary environments. Simulation results show that, compared to recent
methods, the proposed approach achieves superior optimality and sample
efficiency on LTV systems, and indicates potential for stabilizing and optimal
control of nonlinear systems.

Abstract: Transportation accounts for around 27% of green house gas emissions in the
UK. While an obvious priority area for decarbonisation, and aligned to the UK
government goal of reducing emissions by 68% for 2030, the free-market nature
of the transportation sector combined with its fundamentally implicit and
pervasive connections to all aspects of society and national infrastructure
mean that all decarbonisation efforts to date have been siloed within a single
transport sector, e.g. only considering greener aviation fuels. Truly
decarbonising transport requires radical changes to the entire transport
infrastructure, and since that transport does not happen in isolation, a single
user often using multiple modes, we need a view over the whole transport
system. The first step to solving a problem is to understand it. As a result of
the fragmented nature of the transportation sector, there is currently no
system level view. Without the ability to monitor even adjacent transport
domains, the ability for people or organisations to (dynamically) adapt their
operations for decarbonisation outcomes is unrealistic. As transportation is a
complex social-techno-economic system, information and knowledge sharing is a
must to be able to understand and explore potential solutions to the
decarbonisation challenge. We believe a Federated Digital Twinning Approach has
the potential to tackle transport decarbonisation problems, and, in this
extended abstract, we give an overview of the research required to tackle the
fundamental challenges around digital twin design, generation, validation and
verification.

Abstract: Sample-based observability characterizes the ability to reconstruct the
internal state of a dynamical system by using limited output information, i.e.,
when measurements are only infrequently and/or irregularly available. In this
work, we investigate the concept of functional observability, which refers to
the ability to infer a function of the system state from the outputs, within a
samplebased framework. Here, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a
system to be sample-based functionally observable, and formulate conditions on
the sampling schemes such that these are satisfied. Furthermore, we provide a
numerical example, where we demonstrate the applicability of the obtained
results.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating multiplicative fault signals
in linear time-invariant systems by processing its input and output variables,
as well as designing an input signal to maximize the accuracy of such
estimates. The proposed real-time fault estimator is based on a residual
generator used for fault detection and a multiple-output regressor generator,
which feed a moving-horizon linear regression that estimates the parameter
changes. Asymptotic performance guarantees are provided in the presence of
noise. Motivated by the performance bounds, an optimal input design problem is
formulated, for which we provide efficient algorithms and optimality bounds.
Numerical examples demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and the importance
of the optimal input design for accurate fault estimation.

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication is a promising solution for
global wireless coverage, especially in underserved and remote areas. However,
the high relative velocity of LEO satellites induces significant Doppler shifts
that disrupt subcarrier orthogonality and degrade multicarrier system
performance. While the common time-varying Doppler shift can be compensated
relative to a reference point, the residual differential Doppler across users
within the coverage cell remains a significant challenge, causing severe
intercarrier interference. This paper presents a generalized analytical
framework for characterizing both the Doppler shift magnitude and the
differential Doppler in LEO systems. Unlike prior works limited by flat-Earth
assumptions or specific orbital configurations, our model incorporates Earth's
curvature and supports arbitrary elevation angles. Using spherical geometry, we
derive closed-form expressions for Doppler shift based on the central angle
between the satellite and ground users. We further provide a statistical
characterization of both the Doppler shift magnitude and the differential
Doppler in terms of their cumulative distribution function (CDF) and
probability density function (PDF) for uniformly distributed users within a
spherical cap cell. Additionally, we derive a tight upper bound for the Doppler
shift CDF and an exact expression for the maximum differential Doppler
experienced across the coverage region. To mitigate intra-cell Doppler
variation, we implement a user clustering technique that partitions the
coverage area based on a Doppler disparity threshold into spherical sub-cells,
ensuring compliance with 3GPP tolerances. Extensive simulations over realistic
satellite constellations validate our analysis and reveal the impact of
altitude, beamwidth, and satellite-user geometry on Doppler behavior.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on reducing node-to-node information exchange in
distributed control of multiagent networks while improving the overall network
performance. Specifically, we consider a multiagent network that is composed of
leader and follower nodes over a time-varying, connected, and undirected graph.
In contrast to existing works on the event-triggered distributed control
literature, we propose a time-varying edge weight event-triggered control
framework. In this framework, each node dynamically adjusts its edge weights by
increasing them during the transient (active) phase and decreasing them during
the steady-state (idle) phase of the multiagent network. This not only reduces
the number of events in the network but also improves the performance (i.e.,
convergence speed and control effort) of the overall multiagent network.
System-theoretically, we first prove the closed-loop stability of the proposed
event-triggered distributed control framework, where we then show that this
framework does not exhibit a Zeno behavior. Finally, illustrative numerical
examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of this framework.

handled using standard CBFs and relaxed Collision Cone CBFs. In order to

deployment of fusion energy facilities. Drawing on 22 siting criteria -
including state and federal policies, risk and hazard assessments, and spatial

weights and the Weighted Sum Method (WSM) to rank sites based on composite
suitability scores. By focusing on fusion-specific siting needs and
demonstrating the framework through a coal site application, this study
contributes a scalable and transparent decision-support tool for identifying

Abstract: Accurate excavation force prediction is essential for enabling autonomous
operation and optimizing control strategies in earthmoving machinery.
Conventional methods typically require extensive data collection or simulations
across diverse soil types, limiting scalability and adaptability. This paper
proposes a data-efficient framework that calibrates soil parameters using force
data from the prior bucket-loading cycle. Leveraging an analytical soil-tool
interaction model, the fundamental earthmoving equation (FEE), our approach
uses a multi-stage optimization strategy, on soil parameters during the loading
phase. These fitted parameters are then used to predict excavation forces in
the upcoming digging cycle, allowing the system to adapt its control inputs
without the need for extensive data collection or machine learning-based model
training. The framework is validated in high-fidelity simulations using the
Algoryx Dynamics engine, across multiple soil types and excavation
trajectories, demonstrating accurate force predictions with root-mean-square
errors of 10\% to 15\% in primary test cases. This cycle-to-cycle adaptation
strategy showcases the potential for online and scalable efficient path
planning for wheel loader operations.

incorporates state-augmentation by embedding the dual variables in the
constrained optimization formulation directly into the agent's observation

real time while continuing to optimize a primary performance objective. Through
extensive simulations of 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence scenarios, we show that
QaSAL-CPM achieves reliable QoS compliance and improved policy robustness
across various transmitter densities compared to previous approaches. The
proposed framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution for real-time
coexistence optimization in next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: Aiming at simplifying the hardware structure and reducing the energy
consumption in wireless communication via reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RIS), this paper introduces a novel RIS design founded on the correlation
between the phase shift values of the surface elements. First, a correlation
analysis is conducted, considering the azimuth angle of a target device within
a coverage region spanning from $-80^{\circ}$ to $80^{\circ}$. The correlation
is demonstrated for different deployment cases, creating the basis for the new
RIS structure, termed Connected-RIS, where correlated elements are designed to
share the same control signal. The fundamental performance of the proposed
design is then analyzed in terms of control signals, power consumption, and
communication system performance, comparing it to two RIS structures with full
control: one with the same size as the proposed design, and the other employing
the minimum number of elements necessary to satisfy the fair coverage
criterion. The correlation-based RIS design enables three-dimensional passive
beamforming and significantly reduces the number of required load impedances
and control signals, thereby lowering the hardware cost and simplifying the
control circuitry. It also achieves substantial power savings as compared to
the baseline schemes, while maintaining sufficient gain for a fair radio
coverage. For instance, numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed
design reduces the power consumption by almost 86-92\% and the control signals
by 83-98\% compared to operation with fully controlled RIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统冯·诺依曼架构因内存与处理单元间的数据移动存在瓶颈，影响性能和能效，而光子内存计算利用光速优势，提供了替代方案。

Method: 采用交叉耦合微环谐振器和差分光电二极管设计X-pSRAM位单元，支持光域内10 GHz的读写和计算操作，并通过波分复用实现单次n位XOR计算。

Result: 在GlobalFoundries的45SPCLO节点上验证，X-pSRAM的XOR计算能耗为13.2 fJ/bit，支持大规模并行处理。

Conclusion: X-pSRAM为下一代光学计算在密码学、超维计算和神经网络等领域的应用提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Traditional von Neumann architectures suffer from fundamental bottlenecks due
to continuous data movement between memory and processing units, a challenge
that worsens with technology scaling as electrical interconnect delays become
more significant. These limitations impede the performance and energy
efficiency required for modern data-intensive applications. In contrast,
photonic in-memory computing presents a promising alternative by harnessing the
advantages of light, enabling ultra-fast data propagation without
length-dependent impedance, thereby significantly reducing computational
latency and energy consumption. This work proposes a novel differential
photonic static random access memory (pSRAM) bitcell that facilitates
electro-optic data storage while enabling ultra-fast in-memory Boolean XOR
computation. By employing cross-coupled microring resonators and differential
photodiodes, the XOR-augmented pSRAM (X-pSRAM) bitcell achieves at least 10 GHz
read, write, and compute operations entirely in the optical domain.
Additionally, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) enables n-bit XOR
computation in a single-shot operation, supporting massively parallel
processing and enhanced computational efficiency. Validated on GlobalFoundries'
45SPCLO node, the X-pSRAM consumed 13.2 fJ energy per bit for XOR computation,
representing a significant advancement toward next-generation optical computing
with applications in cryptography, hyperdimensional computing, and neural
networks.

Abstract: With the increasing availability of streaming data in dynamic systems, a
critical challenge in data-driven modeling for control is how to efficiently
select informative data to characterize system dynamics. In this work, we
design an online coreset selection method under the framework of set-membership
identification for systems subject to process disturbances, with the objective
of improving data efficiency while ensuring convergence guarantees.
Specifically, we first propose a stacked polyhedral representation that
over-approximates the feasible set of system parameters. Leveraging a
generalized Gr\"unbaum's inequality, we design a geometric selection criterion
for constructing the coreset. To reduce computational complexity, an online
double-description-based constraint reduction method is introduced to simplify
the polyhedral representation. Finally, we analyze the convergence of the
feasible set with respect to the coreset and derive upper bounds on the
selection probability and the expected number of data in the coreset. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through comprehensive
simulation studies.

Abstract: Distributed optimization advances centralized machine learning methods by
enabling parallel and decentralized learning processes over a network of
computing nodes. This work provides an accelerated consensus-based distributed
algorithm for locally non-convex optimization using the gradient-tracking
technique. The proposed algorithm (i) improves the convergence rate by adding
momentum towards the optimal state using the heavy-ball method, while (ii)
addressing general sector-bound nonlinearities over the information-sharing
network. The link nonlinearity includes any sign-preserving odd sector-bound
mapping, for example, log-scale data quantization or clipping in practical
applications. For admissible momentum and gradient-tracking parameters, using
perturbation theory and eigen-spectrum analysis, we prove convergence even in
the presence of sector-bound nonlinearity and for locally non-convex cost
functions. Further, in contrast to most existing weight-stochastic algorithms,
we adopt weight-balanced (WB) network design. This WB design and
perturbation-based analysis allow to handle dynamic directed network of agents
to address possible time-varying setups due to link failures or packet drops.

Conclusion: CAMs框架和SaDE算法为建模和识别具有不确定性的系统提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Classical Cellular Automata (CCAs) are a powerful computational framework for
modeling global spatio-temporal dynamics with local interactions. While CCAs
have been applied across numerous scientific fields, identifying the local rule
that governs observed dynamics remains a challenging task. Moreover, the
underlying assumption of deterministic cell states often limits the
applicability of CCAs to systems characterized by inherent uncertainty. This
study, therefore, focuses on the identification of Cellular Automata on spaces
of probability measures (CAMs), where cell states are represented by
probability distributions. This framework enables the modeling of systems with
probabilistic uncertainty and spatially varying dynamics. Moreover, we
formulate the local rule identification problem as a parameter estimation
problem and propose a meta-heuristic search based on Self-adaptive Differential
Evolution (SaDE) to estimate local rule parameters accurately from the observed
data. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through local rule
identification in two-dimensional CAMs with varying neighborhood types and
radii.

Abstract: This study presents a real-time energy management framework for hybrid
community microgrids integrating photovoltaic, wind, battery energy storage
systems, diesel generators, and grid interconnection. The proposed approach
formulates the dispatch problem as a multi-objective optimization task that
aims to minimize operational costs. Two control strategies are proposed and
evaluated: a conventional rule-based control (RBC) method and an advanced deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) approach utilizing proximal policy optimization
(PPO). A realistic case study based on Australian load and generation profiles
is used to validate the framework. Simulation results demonstrate that DRL-PPO
reduces operational costs by 18%, CO_2 emissions by 20%, and improves system
reliability by 87.5% compared to RBC. Beside, DRL-PPO increases renewable

Motivation: 为了解决网络物理系统中全局和局部控制的协调问题，提出了一种分层分散架构，以优化不同时间尺度的控制策略。

Result: 证明了两种框架下存在确定性最优策略，并研究了它们之间的关系，包括最优值函数差异的界限。

Conclusion: 该架构为网络物理系统提供了灵活的控制策略，局部控制器在FOpt框架下具有更高的自主性。

Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture
for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$
independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each
formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating
at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative
reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a
faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the
COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an
infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller
optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure,
where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First,
the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these
frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two
frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two
optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such
that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.

Abstract: Power systems with high renewable energy penetration are highly influenced by
weather conditions, often facing significant challenges such as persistent
power shortages and severe power fluctuations over long time scales. This paper
addresses the critical need for effective characterization of extreme scenarios
under these situations. First, novel risk indices are proposed to quantify the
severity of continuous power shortages and substantial power fluctuations over
long-term operations. These indices are independent of specific scheduling
strategies and incorporate the system's resource regulation capabilities. By
employing a filtering-based approach, the proposed indices focus on retaining
key characteristics of continuous power shortages and fluctuation events,
enabling the identification of extreme scenarios on long time scales. Secondly,
an extreme scenario generation method is developed using Gaussian mixture
models and sequential Monte Carlo simulation. Especially, this method
periodically evaluates the severity of generated scenarios based on the defined
risk indices, retaining extreme scenarios while discarding less critical ones.
Finally, case studies based on real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed method. The results confirm that integrating the identified extreme
scenarios significantly enhances the system's ability to ensure long-term
security and reliability under high renewable energy penetration.

Result: 该方法实现了仅依赖原始传递函数样本的广义平衡截断，解决了谱分解样本不可得的问题。

Conclusion: 提出的ADI框架为非侵入式广义平衡截断提供了实用解决方案，避免了谱分解样本的需求。

Abstract: There exist two main frameworks for non-intrusive implementations of
approximate balanced truncation: the quadrature-based framework and the
ADI-based framework. Both approaches rely solely on samples of the transfer
function to construct truncated balanced models, eliminating the need for
access to the original model's state-space realization. Recently, the
quadrature-based framework has been extended to various generalizations of
balanced truncation, including positive-real balanced truncation, bounded-real
balanced truncation, and balanced stochastic truncation. While this extension
is theoretically nonintrusive-meaning it does not require the original
state-space realization-it depends on samples of spectral factorizations of the
transfer function. Since practical methods for obtaining such samples are
currently unavailable, this extension remains largely a theoretical
contribution. In this work, we present a non-intrusive ADI-type framework for
these generalized balanced truncation methods that requires only samples of the
original transfer function for implementation.

Result: 修正后的拉普拉斯逆变换与离散时间傅里叶变换（DTFT）混叠理论结果一致，提供了更准确的采样数据系统建模基础。

Conclusion: 论文提出了对Z变换和拉普拉斯逆变换的结构性修订，解决了长期存在的数学不一致性问题，为采样数据系统的建模和分析提供了更准确的基础。

Abstract: This paper revisits the classical formulation of the Z-transform and its
relationship to the inverse Laplace transform (L-1), originally developed by
Ragazzini in sampled-data theory. It identifies a longstanding mathematical
oversight in standard derivations, which typically neglect the contribution
from the infinite arc in the complex plane during inverse Laplace evaluation.
This omission leads to inconsistencies, especially at discontinuities such as t
= 0. By incorporating the full Bromwich contour, including all boundary
contributions, we restore internal consistency between L-1 and the Z-transform,
aligning the corrected L-1 with results from Discrete-Time Fourier Transform
(DTFT) aliasing theory. Consequently, this necessitates a structural revision
of the Z-transform, inverse Laplace transform, and the behavior of the
Heaviside step function at discontinuities, providing a more accurate
foundation for modeling and analysis of sampled-data systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the joint optimization of trajectory planning and
resource allocation for a high-altitude platform stations synthetic aperture
radar (HAPs-SAR) system. To support real-time sensing and conserve the limited
energy budget of the HAPs, the proposed framework assumes that the acquired
radar data are transmitted in real time to a ground base station for SAR image
reconstruction. A dynamic trajectory model is developed, and the power
consumption associated with radar sensing, data transmission, and circular
flight is comprehensively analyzed. In addition, solar energy harvesting is
considered to enhance system sustainability. An energy-aware mixed-integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to maximize radar beam
coverage while satisfying operational constraints. To solve this challenging
problem, a sub-optimal successive convex approximation (SCA)-based framework is
proposed, incorporating iterative optimization and finite search. Simulation
results validate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its
effectiveness in balancing SAR performance, communication reliability, and
energy efficiency. A final SAR imaging simulation on a 9-target lattice
scenario further confirms the practical feasibility of the proposed solution.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a novel life-extending control scheme
for critical helicopter components subjected to significant fatigue loading.
The primary objective is to synthesize a more efficient and less conservative
life-extending control scheme than those currently available in the literature.
The proposed Load Limiting Control (LLC) scheme is a viable solution that
addresses several issues that current life-extending control schemes suffer
from, such as the neglect of fatigue damage induced by the harmonic component
of loads and the inability to distinguish between aggressive and non-aggressive
maneuvers. The proposed LLC scheme treats desired harmonic load limits as limit
boundaries and recasts the problem of load limiting as a vehicle limit by
computing a Control Margin (CM) using a limit detection and avoidance module.
The computed CM is used as a cue to the pilot. The limit detection and
avoidance module comprises an optimization algorithm, a model predictive
controller, and a computationally simple on-board dynamical model. Simulations
were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LLC scheme in limiting
harmonic pitch link loads during flight. One significant outcome is that, with
sufficient training, the pilot can skillfully track the cue within 0.5 seconds
of initiating the tracking task.

Abstract: In contrast to grid-following inverters, Virtual Synchronous Generators
(VSGs) perform well under weak grid conditions but may become unstable when the
grid is strong. Grid strength depends on grid impedance, which unfortunately
varies over time. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive gain-scheduling
control scheme for VSGs. First, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) estimates
the fundamental-frequency grid impedance; then these estimates are fed into an
adaptive gain-scheduling function to recalculate controller parameters under
varying grid conditions. The proposed method is validated in Simulink and
compared with a conventional VSG employing fixed controller gains. The results
demonstrate that settling times and overshoot percentages remain consistent
across different grid conditions. Additionally, previously unseen grid
impedance values are estimated with high accuracy and minimal time delay,
making the approach well suited for real-time gain-scheduling control.

Abstract: The stochastic nature of time delays and sampling intervals in Networked

work presents a modeling approach for Linear Multiple-Input Multiple-Output
Networked Control Systems and introduces a compensation scheme based on the
Filtered Smith Predictor to mitigate the adverse effects of stochastic time

closed-loop performance and significantly reduces response variability compared
to a traditional Filtered Smith Predictor. Notably, it yields a 45% reduction
in worst-case tracking error signal energy relative to an ideal baseline system
with no time delays and constant sampling intervals.

Abstract: Load flow analysis is a fundamental technique used by electrical engineers to
simulate and evaluate power system behavior under steady-state conditions. It
enables efficient operation and control by determining how active and reactive
power flows throughout the system. Selecting an appropriate solution method is
critical to ensuring reliable and economical operation of power generation,
transmission, and distribution networks. While the conventional loop method may
be used in small-scale systems, it is limited by its reliance on
impedance-based load data and its inability to scale to complex networks. In
contrast, iterative techniques such as the Gauss-Seidel (GS) and Newton-Raphson
(NR) methods are better suited for analyzing large systems. Of these, the NR
method offers significant advantages due to its quadratic convergence and
improved numerical stability. This study presents a power flow analysis of a
5-bus system using the Newton-Raphson approach. The system was modeled and
simulated in PowerWorld Simulator (PWS), and a custom MATLAB implementation was
developed to verify the results under a base case scenario. The comparative
analysis demonstrates that the NR method provides accurate and robust solutions
for power flow problems, making it well-suited for evaluating system
performance under various operating conditions.

Abstract: Implementing economy-wide decarbonization strategies based on decarbonizing
the power grid via variable renewable energy (VRE) expansion and
electrification of end-uses requires new approaches for energy infrastructure
planning that consider, among other factors, weather-induced uncertainty in
demand and VRE supply. An energy planning model that fails to account for these
uncertainties can hinder the intended transition efforts to a low-carbon grid
and increase the risk of supply shortage especially during extreme weather
conditions. Here, we consider the generation and transmission expansion problem
of joint power-gas infrastructure and operations planning under the uncertainty
of both demand and renewable supply. We propose two distributionally robust
optimization approaches based on moment (MDRO) and Wasserstein distance (WDRO)
ambiguity sets to endogenize these uncertainties and account for the change in
the underlying distribution of these parameters that is caused by the climate
change, among other factors. Furthermore, our model considers the risk-aversion
of the energy planners in the modeling framework via the conditional
value-at-risk (CVaR) metric. An equivalent mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) reformulation of both modeling frameworks is presented, and a
computationally efficient approximation scheme to obtain near-optimal solutions
is proposed. We demonstrate the resulting DRO planning models and solution
strategy via a New England case study under different levels of end-use
electrification and decarbonization targets. Our experiments systematically
explore different modeling aspects and compare the DRO models with stochastic
programming (SP) results.

Abstract: To address challenges in improving self-consumption of renewables and
resilience in local residential power systems, the earlier work of the authors
introduced a novel multi-energy management concept, integrating bidirectional
power routing and electricity-hydrogen conversion. This paper focuses on an
experimental verification of the bidirectional power router based on
line-switching, the essential hardware to realize the concept. The primary
contribution is the validation of the router's capability to handle dynamic
change of bidirectional power flow. Furthermore, to achieve bidirectional power
routing without affecting the smooth and stable operation of the power system,
a novel algorithm for router's switching is designed based on power flow
monitoring. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through an
experiment using a setup with a commercially available stationary battery.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了电力系统可靠性评估的效率和准确性，为大规模系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: With a sustainable increase in the scale of power system, the number of
states in the state space grows exponentially, and the reliability assessment
of the power system faces enormous challenges. Traditional state-by-state
assessment methods, such as state enumeration (SE) and Monte Carlo simulation
(MCS) methods, have encountered performance bottlenecks in terms of efficiency
and accuracy. In this paper, the Boolean lattice representation theory of the
state space was studied, and a dichotomy method was proposed to efficiently
partition the state space into some disjoint sub-lattices with a relatively
small number of optimal power flow (OPF) operations. Based on lattice
partition, the reliability indices of the entire space can be calculated
lattice-by-lattice. In addition, alone with the partitioning procedure, the
calculated loss of load probability (LOLP) monotonically increases and rapidly
tends to the analytic value with the designated error bound. Moreover, we
designed a customized Monte Carlo sampling method in lattices of interest to
compute expected energy not supply (EENS). The experiments are conducted on the
RBTS and RTS-79 systems. The results show that the proposed method achieves the
analytic LOLP of the RBTS system after five hundreds of OPF operations, which
is about hundreds of times faster than traditional methods, and the designed
Monte Carlo sampling method converged after thousands of OPF operations on test
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的、数据驱动的控制框架，用于有限时域线性时变系统的线性二次控制。通过分析对偶问题结构，开发了一种非迭代的半定规划算法，直接从数据中计算最优反馈增益，无需模型识别。

Motivation: 解决线性时变系统中有限时域线性二次控制问题，传统方法依赖模型识别且效率低，本文旨在提供一种更高效的数据驱动方法。

Method: 将线性二次问题转化为非凸优化问题，分析其对偶结构，利用对偶问题的凸性和KKT条件，开发了一种非迭代的半定规划算法。

Result: 提出的方法在完全未知的线性时变系统中具有全局最优性保证，且在有限时域线性时不变系统中仅需单条输入状态轨迹即可识别最优策略。

Conclusion: 该方法为时变环境下的Q学习提供了新的优化视角，并在仿真中表现出优于现有方法的性能和样本效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a sample-efficient, data-driven control framework for
finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) control of linear time-varying (LTV)
systems. In contrast to the time-invariant case, the time-varying LQ problem
involves a differential Riccati equation (DRE) with time-dependent parameters
and terminal boundary constraints. We formulate the LQ problem as a nonconvex
optimization problem and conduct a rigorous analysis of its dual structure. By
exploiting the inherent convexity of the dual problem and analyzing the KKT
conditions, we derive an explicit relationship between the optimal dual
solution and the parameters of the associated Q-function in time-varying case.
This theoretical insight supports the development of a novel, sample-efficient,
non-iterative semidefinite programming (SDP) algorithm that directly computes
the optimal sequence of feedback gains from an ensemble of input-state data
sequences without model identification. The resulting convex, data-dependent
framework provides global optimality guarantees for completely unknown LTV
systems. As a special case, the method also applies to finite-horizon LQ
control of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In this setting, a single
input-state trajectory suffices to identify the optimal LQ feedback policy,
improving significantly over existing Q-learning approaches for finite horizon
LTI systems that typically require data from multiple episodes. The approach
provides a new optimization-based perspective on Q-learning in time-varying
settings and contributes to the broader understanding of data-driven control in
non-stationary environments. Simulation results show that, compared to recent
methods, the proposed approach achieves superior optimality and sample
efficiency on LTV systems, and indicates potential for stabilizing and optimal
control of nonlinear systems.

Abstract: Transportation accounts for around 27% of green house gas emissions in the
UK. While an obvious priority area for decarbonisation, and aligned to the UK
government goal of reducing emissions by 68% for 2030, the free-market nature
of the transportation sector combined with its fundamentally implicit and
pervasive connections to all aspects of society and national infrastructure
mean that all decarbonisation efforts to date have been siloed within a single
transport sector, e.g. only considering greener aviation fuels. Truly
decarbonising transport requires radical changes to the entire transport
infrastructure, and since that transport does not happen in isolation, a single
user often using multiple modes, we need a view over the whole transport
system. The first step to solving a problem is to understand it. As a result of
the fragmented nature of the transportation sector, there is currently no
system level view. Without the ability to monitor even adjacent transport
domains, the ability for people or organisations to (dynamically) adapt their
operations for decarbonisation outcomes is unrealistic. As transportation is a
complex social-techno-economic system, information and knowledge sharing is a
must to be able to understand and explore potential solutions to the
decarbonisation challenge. We believe a Federated Digital Twinning Approach has
the potential to tackle transport decarbonisation problems, and, in this
extended abstract, we give an overview of the research required to tackle the
fundamental challenges around digital twin design, generation, validation and
verification.

Abstract: Sample-based observability characterizes the ability to reconstruct the
internal state of a dynamical system by using limited output information, i.e.,
when measurements are only infrequently and/or irregularly available. In this
work, we investigate the concept of functional observability, which refers to
the ability to infer a function of the system state from the outputs, within a
samplebased framework. Here, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a
system to be sample-based functionally observable, and formulate conditions on
the sampling schemes such that these are satisfied. Furthermore, we provide a
numerical example, where we demonstrate the applicability of the obtained
results.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating multiplicative fault signals
in linear time-invariant systems by processing its input and output variables,
as well as designing an input signal to maximize the accuracy of such
estimates. The proposed real-time fault estimator is based on a residual
generator used for fault detection and a multiple-output regressor generator,
which feed a moving-horizon linear regression that estimates the parameter
changes. Asymptotic performance guarantees are provided in the presence of
noise. Motivated by the performance bounds, an optimal input design problem is
formulated, for which we provide efficient algorithms and optimality bounds.
Numerical examples demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and the importance
of the optimal input design for accurate fault estimation.

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication is a promising solution for
global wireless coverage, especially in underserved and remote areas. However,
the high relative velocity of LEO satellites induces significant Doppler shifts
that disrupt subcarrier orthogonality and degrade multicarrier system
performance. While the common time-varying Doppler shift can be compensated
relative to a reference point, the residual differential Doppler across users
within the coverage cell remains a significant challenge, causing severe
intercarrier interference. This paper presents a generalized analytical
framework for characterizing both the Doppler shift magnitude and the
differential Doppler in LEO systems. Unlike prior works limited by flat-Earth
assumptions or specific orbital configurations, our model incorporates Earth's
curvature and supports arbitrary elevation angles. Using spherical geometry, we
derive closed-form expressions for Doppler shift based on the central angle
between the satellite and ground users. We further provide a statistical
characterization of both the Doppler shift magnitude and the differential
Doppler in terms of their cumulative distribution function (CDF) and
probability density function (PDF) for uniformly distributed users within a
spherical cap cell. Additionally, we derive a tight upper bound for the Doppler
shift CDF and an exact expression for the maximum differential Doppler
experienced across the coverage region. To mitigate intra-cell Doppler
variation, we implement a user clustering technique that partitions the
coverage area based on a Doppler disparity threshold into spherical sub-cells,
ensuring compliance with 3GPP tolerances. Extensive simulations over realistic
satellite constellations validate our analysis and reveal the impact of
altitude, beamwidth, and satellite-user geometry on Doppler behavior.

Result: 理论证明了闭环稳定性，且避免了Zeno行为；数值实验验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在减少信息交换的同时提升了多智能体网络的整体性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on reducing node-to-node information exchange in
distributed control of multiagent networks while improving the overall network
performance. Specifically, we consider a multiagent network that is composed of
leader and follower nodes over a time-varying, connected, and undirected graph.
In contrast to existing works on the event-triggered distributed control
literature, we propose a time-varying edge weight event-triggered control
framework. In this framework, each node dynamically adjusts its edge weights by
increasing them during the transient (active) phase and decreasing them during
the steady-state (idle) phase of the multiagent network. This not only reduces
the number of events in the network but also improves the performance (i.e.,
convergence speed and control effort) of the overall multiagent network.
System-theoretically, we first prove the closed-loop stability of the proposed
event-triggered distributed control framework, where we then show that this
framework does not exhibit a Zeno behavior. Finally, illustrative numerical
examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of this framework.

effectiveness of the TSG-guided MPC-CBF approach.

Motivation: 传统心血管磁共振（CMR）在儿科和先天性心脏病中需要多次扫描，耗时较长。本研究旨在通过深度学习技术，将2D自由呼吸实时电影图像拼接为3D电影数据集，以提高效率和准确性。

Method: 训练了四个深度学习模型，分别用于对比度校正、呼吸运动校正、超分辨率重建和心脏结构分割。在10名患者中验证了该方法，并与传统成像进行了比较。

Result: 所有实时数据成功转换为3D电影数据集，处理时间小于1分钟。心室体积和血管直径与传统成像结果一致，但右肺动脉直径略有高估。

Conclusion: 该方法能够快速生成3D电影数据集，与传统成像结果一致，有望显著提升临床CMR的效率。

Abstract: Background: Conventional cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in
paediatric and congenital heart disease uses 2D, breath-hold, balanced steady
state free precession (bSSFP) cine imaging for assessment of function and
cardiac-gated, respiratory-navigated, static 3D bSSFP whole-heart imaging for
anatomical assessment. Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing
real-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully
segmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were
trained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;
b) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice
direction); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,
RV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients
undergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on
prospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative
metrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D
cines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.
Results: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a
total post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant
biases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and
correlation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,
although there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from
concatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models. Our method
has short acquisition and reconstruction times with fully segmented data being
available within 2 minutes. The good agreement with conventional imaging
suggests that our method could help to significantly speed up CMR in clinical
practice.

Result: 在两个数据集上，FedCLAM在医学分割任务中优于八种前沿方法。

Conclusion: FedCLAM有效解决了医学图像联邦学习中的特征差异问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized training approach that keeps data under
stakeholder control while achieving superior performance over isolated
training. While inter-institutional feature discrepancies pose a challenge in
all federated settings, medical imaging is particularly affected due to diverse
imaging devices and population variances, which can diminish the global model's
effectiveness. Existing aggregation methods generally fail to adapt across
varied circumstances. To address this, we propose FedCLAM, which integrates
\textit{client-adaptive momentum} terms derived from each client's loss
reduction during local training, as well as a \textit{personalized dampening
factor} to curb overfitting. We further introduce a novel \textit{intensity
alignment} loss that matches predicted and ground-truth foreground
distributions to handle heterogeneous image intensity profiles across
institutions and devices. Extensive evaluations on two datasets show that
FedCLAM surpasses eight cutting-edge methods in medical segmentation tasks,
underscoring its efficacy. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents an FeFET-based active pixel sensor that performs

multi-domain polarization states of ferroelectric layers. The proposed design
integrates a programmable FeFET into a 3-transistor pixel circuit, where the
FeFET's non-volatile conductance encodes the weight, and the photodiode voltage
drop encodes the input. Their interaction generates an output current
proportional to the product, enabling in-pixel analog multiplication.
Accumulation is achieved by summing output currents along shared column lines,
realizing full MAC functionality within the image sensor array. Extensive
HSPICE simulations, using 45 nm CMOS models, validate the operation and confirm
the scalability of the design. This compact and power-efficient architecture
minimizes data movement, making it ideal for real-time edge computing,

Abstract: Segmentation of brain structures from MRI is crucial for evaluating brain
morphology, yet existing CNN and transformer-based methods struggle to
delineate complex structures accurately. While current diffusion models have
shown promise in image segmentation, they are inadequate when applied directly
to brain MRI due to neglecting anatomical information. To address this, we
propose Collaborative Anatomy Diffusion (CA-Diff), a framework integrating
spatial anatomical features to enhance segmentation accuracy of the diffusion
model. Specifically, we introduce distance field as an auxiliary anatomical
condition to provide global spatial context, alongside a collaborative
diffusion process to model its joint distribution with anatomical structures,
enabling effective utilization of anatomical features for segmentation.
Furthermore, we introduce a consistency loss to refine relationships between
the distance field and anatomical structures and design a time adapted channel
attention module to enhance the U-Net feature fusion procedure. Extensive
experiments show that CA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, particularly in
capturing how the brain transitions between various functional states.
Recently, metastability, which refers to temporarily stable brain states, has
offered a promising paradigm to quantify complex brain signals into
interpretable, discretized representations. In particular, compared to
cluster-based machine learning approaches, tokenization approaches leveraging
vector quantization have shown promise in representation learning with powerful
reconstruction and predictive capabilities. However, most existing methods
ignore brain transition dependencies and lack a quantification of brain
dynamics into representative and stable embeddings. In this study, we propose a
Hierarchical State space-based Tokenization network, termed HST, which
quantizes brain states and transitions in a hierarchical structure based on a
state space-based model. We introduce a refined clustered Vector-Quantization
Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) that incorporates quantization error feedback
and clustering to improve quantization performance while facilitating
metastability with representative and stable token representations. We validate
our HST on two public fMRI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in
quantifying the hierarchical dynamics of the brain and its potential in disease
diagnosis and reconstruction performance. Our method offers a promising
framework for the characterization of brain dynamics, facilitating the analysis
of metastability.

experiment is carried out in different conditions like distance, rotation, and
tilt also considering different surrounding illuminations like ambient light
and no light conditions to estimate the blur levels in S2SVLC. In this
experimental investigation two types of coding, American Standard code for
information interchange (ASCII), and quick response (QR) code are used for data
transmission in S2SVLC. The obtained results indicate that, the proposed
technique is proven to improve the recovery efficiency to 96% in the receiver
end at different conditions.

TL;DR: MedRegion-CT是一个区域聚焦的多模态大语言模型框架，通过区域代表令牌池化、通用分割模型和患者特定属性提取，显著提升了CT报告生成的临床相关性和自然语言质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局特征，难以捕捉区域特异性细节，可能导致某些异常被忽略。

Method: 1. 引入区域代表令牌池化（$R^2$ Token Pooling）提取3D CT特征；2. 使用通用分割模型生成伪掩码，提取区域中心特征；3. 利用分割结果提取患者特定属性并转换为文本提示。

Result: 在RadGenome-Chest CT上的实验表明，MedRegion-CT在自然语言生成质量和临床相关性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MedRegion-CT通过区域聚焦的方法显著提升了CT报告生成的性能，同时保持了可解释性。

Abstract: The recent release of RadGenome-Chest CT has significantly advanced CT-based
report generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on global
features, making it challenging to capture region-specific details, which may
cause certain abnormalities to go unnoticed. To address this, we propose
MedRegion-CT, a region-focused Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM)
framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce Region
Representative ($R^2$) Token Pooling, which utilizes a 2D-wise pretrained
vision model to efficiently extract 3D CT features. This approach generates
global tokens representing overall slice features and region tokens
highlighting target areas, enabling the MLLM to process comprehensive
information effectively. Second, a universal segmentation model generates
pseudo-masks, which are then processed by a mask encoder to extract
region-centric features. This allows the MLLM to focus on clinically relevant
regions, using six predefined region masks. Third, we leverage segmentation
results to extract patient-specific attributions, including organ size,
diameter, and locations. These are converted into text prompts, enriching the
MLLM's understanding of patient-specific contexts. To ensure rigorous
evaluation, we conducted benchmark experiments on report generation using the
RadGenome-Chest CT. MedRegion-CT achieved state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing methods in natural language generation quality and
clinical relevance while maintaining interpretability. The code for our
framework is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多器官分割模型存在细节不准确、依赖几何提示和空间信息丢失等问题，CRISP-SAM2旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 采用跨模态上下文语义转换、语义提示策略、记忆自更新和掩码细化过程。

Result: 在七个公共数据集上的实验表明，CRISP-SAM2优于现有模型。

Conclusion: CRISP-SAM2在解决多器官分割问题中表现出色，尤其针对现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image
processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop
effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current
multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,
dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing
these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal
Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a
promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual
descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual
inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive
cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into
the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.
To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting
strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of
challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy
for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical
imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on
seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models.
Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby
confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations
mentioned earlier. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色缺乏特异性标记，而IHC染色受限于组织可用性和抗体特异性。虚拟染色技术有望高效生成IHC图像，但现有方法在分解染色风格与组织结构、可控染色及结构一致性建模方面存在不足。

Method: 设计了互信息引导的扩散模型，包括全局互信息能量函数、时间步定制的反向扩散过程及局部互信息驱动的对比学习策略，以分解染色风格与组织结构、精确控制染色强度并确保细胞级结构一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在虚拟染色任务上优于现有技术，展现了其生物医学应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的互信息引导扩散模型在虚拟染色任务中表现出色，为生物医学图像分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining visualizes histology but lacks
specificity for diagnostic markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
provides protein-targeted staining but is restricted by tissue availability and
antibody specificity. Virtual staining, i.e., computationally translating the
H&E image to its IHC counterpart while preserving the tissue structure, is
promising for efficient IHC generation. Existing virtual staining methods still
face key challenges: 1) effective decomposition of staining style and tissue
structure, 2) controllable staining process adaptable to diverse tissue and
proteins, and 3) rigorous structural consistency modelling to handle the
non-pixel-aligned nature of paired H&E and IHC images. This study proposes a
mutual-information (MI)-guided score-based diffusion model for unpaired virtual
staining. Specifically, we design 1) a global MI-guided energy function that
disentangles the tissue structure and staining characteristics across
modalities, 2) a novel timestep-customized reverse diffusion process for
precise control of the staining intensity and structural reconstruction, and 3)
a local MI-driven contrastive learning strategy to ensure the cellular level
structural consistency between H&E-IHC images. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its biomedical potential. Codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Motivation: 多源CT扫描数据因成像协议、扫描仪和患者群体差异导致域偏移，需提升模型的跨域泛化能力。

Method: 结合VREx（最小化跨域风险方差）和Mixup数据增强（线性插值输入和标签），提升模型泛化性和鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个数据源上平均宏F1分数达0.96，表现优异。

Conclusion: VREx和Mixup的结合有效解决了域偏移问题，提升了模型的跨域性能。

Abstract: We present our solution for the Multi-Source COVID-19 Detection Challenge,
which aims to classify chest CT scans into COVID and Non-COVID categories
across data collected from four distinct hospitals and medical centers. A major
challenge in this task lies in the domain shift caused by variations in imaging
protocols, scanners, and patient populations across institutions. To enhance
the cross-domain generalization of our model, we incorporate Variance Risk
Extrapolation (VREx) into the training process. VREx encourages the model to
maintain consistent performance across multiple source domains by explicitly
minimizing the variance of empirical risks across environments. This
regularization strategy reduces overfitting to center-specific features and
promotes learning of domain-invariant representations. We further apply Mixup
data augmentation to improve generalization and robustness. Mixup interpolates
both the inputs and labels of randomly selected pairs of training samples,
encouraging the model to behave linearly between examples and enhancing its
resilience to noise and limited data. Our method achieves an average macro F1
score of 0.96 across the four sources on the validation set, demonstrating
strong generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心肌梗死是全球主要死因，但ECG早期诊断依赖大量标注数据，实践中常稀缺。

Method: 合成具有可调MI形态和真实噪声的12导联ECG，结合自监督掩码自编码和联合重建-分类目标预训练模型。

Result: 合成ECG保留关键形态特征，预训练在低数据场景下提升分类性能（AUC最高提升4个百分点）。

Conclusion: 合成ECG可有效改善心肌梗死检测，尤其在临床数据有限时。

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a major cause of death globally, and accurate early
diagnosis from electrocardiograms (ECGs) remains a clinical priority. Deep
learning models have shown promise for automated ECG interpretation, but
require large amounts of labeled data, which are often scarce in practice. We
propose a physiology-aware pipeline that (i) synthesizes 12-lead ECGs with
tunable MI morphology and realistic noise, and (ii) pre-trains recurrent and
transformer classifiers with self-supervised masked-autoencoding plus a joint
reconstruction-classification objective. We validate the realism of synthetic
ECGs via statistical and visual analysis, confirming that key morphological
features are preserved. Pretraining on synthetic data consistently improved
classification performance, particularly in low-data settings, with AUC gains
of up to 4 percentage points. These results show that controlled synthetic ECGs
can help improve MI detection when real clinical data is limited.

Motivation: MLLMs在医学图像分析中具有巨大潜力，但其预测的准确性和校准误差在不同人口统计子群中的表现需要深入分析，以确保临床实践中的安全部署。

Method: 提出了CALIN方法，通过双层次程序（从总体到子群）估计校准矩阵，并在推理时应用这些矩阵校准预测置信度。

Result: 在三个医学影像数据集上的实验表明，CALIN能有效确保公平的置信校准，同时提高预测准确性，并最小化公平性与效用的权衡。

Conclusion: CALIN是一种有效的推理时校准方法，能够减少MLLMs在医学图像分类中的校准偏差和人口统计不公平性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enormous potential to perform
few-shot in-context learning in the context of medical image analysis. However,
safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an
in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated
calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In
this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and
demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot
in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an
inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases.
Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by
calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the
population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this
estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference.
Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image
classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for
chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair
confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall
prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication among preterm
neonates, with portable X-ray imaging serving as the standard diagnostic
modality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). However, lung magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive alternative that avoids sedation
and radiation while providing detailed insights into the underlying mechanisms
of BPD. Leveraging high-resolution 3D MRI data, advanced image processing and
semantic segmentation algorithms can be developed to assist clinicians in
identifying the etiology of BPD. In this dataset, we present MRI scans paired
with corresponding semantic segmentations of the lungs and trachea for 40
neonates, the majority of whom are diagnosed with BPD. The imaging data consist
of free-breathing 3D stack-of-stars radial gradient echo acquisitions, known as
the StarVIBE series. Additionally, we provide comprehensive clinical data and
baseline segmentation models, validated against clinical assessments, to
support further research and development in neonatal lung imaging.

Abstract: In contemporary surgical research and practice, accurately comprehending 3D
surgical scenes with text-promptable capabilities is particularly crucial for
surgical planning and real-time intra-operative guidance, where precisely
identifying and interacting with surgical tools and anatomical structures is
paramount. However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model
(VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for
real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a
novel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce
a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything
model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented
language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more
in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose
semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of
semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and
semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization,
which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training,
particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to
demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves
the way for developing next-generation intelligent surgical systems by
enhancing surgical precision and safety. Our code is available at:

Abstract: We introduce MRF-DiPh, a novel physics informed denoising diffusion approach
for multiparametric tissue mapping from highly accelerated, transient-state
quantitative MRI acquisitions like Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF). Our
method is derived from a proximal splitting formulation, incorporating a
pretrained denoising diffusion model as an effective image prior to regularize
the MRF inverse problem. Further, during reconstruction it simultaneously
enforces two key physical constraints: (1) k-space measurement consistency and
(2) adherence to the Bloch response model. Numerical experiments on in-vivo
brain scans data show that MRF-DiPh outperforms deep learning and compressed
sensing MRF baselines, providing more accurate parameter maps while better
preserving measurement fidelity and physical model consistency-critical for
solving reliably inverse problems in medical imaging.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在医疗数据共享中具有潜力，但数据不足和非独立同分布问题限制了其效果。

Method: 使用两类特定的深度卷积生成对抗网络（DCGAN）生成合成图像，并将其整合到联邦学习训练中。

Result: 实验表明，适量合成图像将FedAvg的AUC从0.9206提升至0.9237，FedProx从0.9429提升至0.9538。

Conclusion: 生成AI数据增强能有效提升FL性能，但需平衡真实与合成数据的比例。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without
exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered
by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data
across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based
data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the
federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images.
Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative
Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then
simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast
ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are
adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating
a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to
0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that
excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the
importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our
findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to
enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）虽减少辐射，但图像噪声和伪影影响诊断准确性，现有方法在保留细节方面存在不足。

Method: 提出FD-DiT，采用扩散策略和频率解耦技术，结合滑动稀疏局部注意力和动态融合策略，优化图像重建。

Result: 实验表明，FD-DiT在相同剂量下，噪声和伪影抑制效果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FD-DiT通过频率域导向和动态融合，显著提升了LDCT图像重建质量。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but suffers
from image artifacts and loss of detail due to quantum and electronic noise,
potentially impacting diagnostic accuracy. Transformer combined with diffusion
models has been a promising approach for image generation. Nevertheless,
existing methods exhibit limitations in preserving finegrained image details.
To address this issue, frequency domain-directed diffusion transformer (FD-DiT)
is proposed for LDCT reconstruction. FD-DiT centers on a diffusion strategy
that progressively introduces noise until the distribution statistically aligns
with that of LDCT data, followed by denoising processing. Furthermore, we
employ a frequency decoupling technique to concentrate noise primarily in
high-frequency domain, thereby facilitating effective capture of essential
anatomical structures and fine details. A hybrid denoising network is then
utilized to optimize the overall data reconstruction process. To enhance the
capability in recognizing high-frequency noise, we incorporate sliding sparse
local attention to leverage the sparsity and locality of shallow-layer
information, propagating them via skip connections for improving feature
representation. Finally, we propose a learnable dynamic fusion strategy for
optimal component integration. Experimental results demonstrate that at
identical dose levels, LDCT images reconstructed by FD-DiT exhibit superior
noise and artifact suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Echocardiography is routine for cardiac examination. However, 2D ultrasound
(US) struggles with accurate metric calculation and direct observation of 3D
cardiac structures. Moreover, 3D US is limited by low resolution, small field
of view and scarce availability in practice. Constructing the cardiac
anatomical twin from 2D images is promising to provide precise treatment
planning and clinical quantification. However, it remains challenging due to
the rare paired data, complex structures, and US noises. In this study, we
introduce a novel generative framework UltraTwin, to obtain cardiac anatomical
twin from sparse multi-view 2D US. Our contribution is three-fold. First,
pioneered the construction of a real-world and high-quality dataset containing
strictly paired multi-view 2D US and CT, and pseudo-paired data. Second, we
propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to achieve hierarchical reconstruction
optimization. Last, we introduce an implicit autoencoder for topology-aware
constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraTwin reconstructs
high-quality anatomical twins versus strong competitors. We believe it advances
anatomical twin modeling for potential applications in personalized cardiac
care.

Motivation: 由于MRI无电离辐射，适用于儿科疾病如囊性纤维化的肺部成像，但缺乏定量评分系统。APL评分的开发旨在填补这一空白。

Method: APL评分包括五个步骤：图像加载、AI肺部分割、肺边界切片采样、像素级标注、量化与报告。

Conclusion: APL评分有望优化临床工作流程，并扩展至其他肺部疾病和MRI序列。

Abstract: Lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ultrashort echo-time (UTE)
represents a recent breakthrough in lung structure imaging, providing image
resolution and quality comparable to computed tomography (CT). Due to the
absence of ionising radiation, MRI is often preferred over CT in paediatric
diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common genetic disorders
in Caucasians. To assess structural lung damage in CF imaging, CT scoring
systems provide valuable quantitative insights for disease diagnosis and
progression. However, few quantitative scoring systems are available in
structural lung MRI (e.g., UTE-MRI). To provide fast and accurate
quantification in lung MRI, we investigated the feasibility of novel Artificial
intelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) scoring for CF. APL scoring
consists of 5 stages, including 1) image loading, 2) AI lung segmentation, 3)
lung-bounded slice sampling, 4) pixel-level annotation, and 5) quantification
and reporting. The results shows that our APL scoring took 8.2 minutes per
subject, which was more than twice as fast as the previous grid-level scoring.
Additionally, our pixel-level scoring was statistically more accurate
(p=0.021), while strongly correlating with grid-level scoring (R=0.973,
p=5.85e-9). This tool has great potential to streamline the workflow of UTE
lung MRI in clinical settings, and be extended to other structural lung MRI
sequences (e.g., BLADE MRI), and for other lung diseases (e.g.,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法依赖经验设计，缺乏理论支持，影响可靠性。

Conclusion: AFUNet通过理论驱动的设计，显著提升了HDR图像重构的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Existing learning-based methods effectively reconstruct HDR images from
multi-exposure LDR inputs with extended dynamic range and improved detail, but
they rely more on empirical design rather than theoretical foundation, which
can impact their reliability. To address these limitations, we propose the
cross-iterative Alignment and Fusion deep Unfolding Network (AFUNet), where HDR
reconstruction is systematically decoupled into two interleaved subtasks --
alignment and fusion -- optimized through alternating refinement, achieving
synergy between the two subtasks to enhance the overall performance. Our method
formulates multi-exposure HDR reconstruction from a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
estimation perspective, explicitly incorporating spatial correspondence priors
across LDR images and naturally bridging the alignment and fusion subproblems
through joint constraints. Building on the mathematical foundation, we
reimagine traditional iterative optimization through unfolding -- transforming
the conventional solution process into an end-to-end trainable AFUNet with
carefully designed modules that work progressively. Specifically, each
iteration of AFUNet incorporates an Alignment-Fusion Module (AFM) that
alternates between a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) for alignment and a Channel
Fusion Module (CFM) for adaptive feature fusion, progressively bridging
misaligned content and exposure discrepancies. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate AFUNet's superior performance,
consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Generating radiology reports from CT scans remains a complex task due to the
nuanced nature of medical imaging and the variability in clinical
documentation. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework for generating
renal radiology reports from 2D CT slices. First, we extract structured
abnormality features using a multi-task learning model trained to identify
lesion attributes such as location, size, enhancement, and attenuation. These
extracted features are subsequently combined with the corresponding CT image
and fed into a fine-tuned vision-language model to generate natural language
report sentences aligned with clinical findings. We conduct experiments on a
curated dataset of renal CT studies with manually annotated
sentence-slice-feature triplets and evaluate performance using both
classification metrics and natural language generation metrics. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms random baselines across all
abnormality types, and the generated reports capture key clinical content with
reasonable textual accuracy. This exploratory work highlights the feasibility
of modular, feature-informed report generation for renal imaging. Future
efforts will focus on extending this pipeline to 3D CT volumes and further
improving clinical fidelity in multimodal medical AI systems.

Motivation: 医疗图像数据因隐私和监管限制难以获取，且标注成本高，合成数据生成成为解决方案。

Method: 采用扩散模型生成合成胎儿头部超声图像与分割掩码，用于增强真实数据集并微调Segment Anything Model (SAM)。

Result: 合成数据能有效捕捉真实图像特征，在少量真实图像-掩码对训练下，分割性能达到最佳水平（Dice分数分别为94.66%和94.38%）。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗图像分割提供了一种高效的数据增强解决方案，尤其在数据稀缺时表现优异。

Abstract: Medical image data is less accessible than in other domains due to privacy
and regulatory constraints. In addition, labeling requires costly,
time-intensive manual image annotation by clinical experts. To overcome these
challenges, synthetic medical data generation offers a promising solution.
Generative AI (GenAI), employing generative deep learning models, has proven
effective at producing realistic synthetic images. This study proposes a novel
mask-guided GenAI approach using diffusion models to generate synthetic fetal
head ultrasound images paired with segmentation masks. These synthetic pairs
augment real datasets for supervised fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). Our results show that the synthetic data captures real image features
effectively, and this approach reaches state-of-the-art fetal head
segmentation, especially when trained with a limited number of real image-mask
pairs. In particular, the segmentation reaches Dice Scores of 94.66\% and
94.38\% using a handful of ultrasound images from the Spanish and African
cohorts, respectively. Our code, models, and data are available on GitHub.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在前列腺分割中因'黑盒'特性难以被临床医生接受的问题。

Method: 采用多层回归方案进行粗到细分割，基于线性模型的特征提取，引入边界注意力机制和两步流水线解决类别不平衡。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最佳性能，DSC大于0.9，模型轻量且高效。

Conclusion: GUSL为医学图像分割提供了高效、透明且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Prostate and zonal segmentation is a crucial step for clinical diagnosis of
prostate cancer (PCa). Computer-aided diagnosis tools for prostate segmentation
are based on the deep learning (DL) paradigm. However, deep neural networks are
perceived as "black-box" solutions by physicians, thus making them less
practical for deployment in the clinical setting. In this paper, we introduce a
feed-forward machine learning model, named Green U-shaped Learning (GUSL),
suitable for medical image segmentation without backpropagation. GUSL
introduces a multi-layer regression scheme for coarse-to-fine segmentation. Its
feature extraction is based on a linear model, which enables seamless
interpretability during feature extraction. Also, GUSL introduces a mechanism
for attention on the prostate boundaries, which is an error-prone region, by
employing regression to refine the predictions through residue correction. In
addition, a two-step pipeline approach is used to mitigate the class imbalance,
an issue inherent in medical imaging problems. After conducting experiments on
two publicly available datasets and one private dataset, in both prostate gland
and zonal segmentation tasks, GUSL achieves state-of-the-art performance among
other DL-based models. Notably, GUSL features a very energy-efficient pipeline,
since it has a model size several times smaller and less complexity than the
rest of the solutions. In all datasets, GUSL achieved a Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC) performance greater than $0.9$ for gland segmentation.
Considering also its lightweight model size and transparency in feature
extraction, it offers a competitive and practical package for medical imaging
applications.

Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床诊断中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据且难以应对低对比度和模糊边界等挑战。

Method: 提出MedSAM-CA，结合CBR-Net（卷积注意力增强边界细化网络）和Atte-FFB（注意力增强特征融合块），优化边界信息恢复和多级特征融合。

Conclusion: MedSAM-CA在低资源临床场景中表现出色，显著减少对标注数据的依赖并提升分割精度。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning, where accurate boundary delineation is essential for
precise lesion localization, organ identification, and quantitative assessment.
In recent years, deep learning-based methods have significantly advanced
segmentation accuracy. However, two major challenges remain. First, the
performance of these methods heavily relies on large-scale annotated datasets,
which are often difficult to obtain in medical scenarios due to privacy
concerns and high annotation costs. Second, clinically challenging scenarios,
such as low contrast in certain imaging modalities and blurry lesion boundaries
caused by malignancy, still pose obstacles to precise segmentation. To address
these challenges, we propose MedSAM-CA, an architecture-level fine-tuning
approach that mitigates reliance on extensive manual annotations by adapting
the pretrained foundation model, Medical Segment Anything (MedSAM). MedSAM-CA
introduces two key components: the Convolutional Attention-Enhanced Boundary
Refinement Network (CBR-Net) and the Attention-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block
(Atte-FFB). CBR-Net operates in parallel with the MedSAM encoder to recover
boundary information potentially overlooked by long-range attention mechanisms,
leveraging hierarchical convolutional processing. Atte-FFB, embedded in the
MedSAM decoder, fuses multi-level fine-grained features from skip connections
in CBR-Net with global representations upsampled within the decoder to enhance
boundary delineation accuracy. Experiments on publicly available datasets
covering dermoscopy, CT, and MRI imaging modalities validate the effectiveness
of MedSAM-CA. On dermoscopy dataset, MedSAM-CA achieves 94.43% Dice with only
2% of full training data, reaching 97.25% of full-data training performance,
demonstrating strong effectiveness in low-resource clinical settings.

Result: 在两个公开MRI数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MDPG通过多域先验引导和k空间正则化，显著提升了MRI重建的数据一致性和图像质量。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is essential in medical
diagnostics. As the latest generative models, diffusion models (DMs) have
struggled to produce high-fidelity images due to their stochastic nature in
image domains. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) yield both compact and detailed
prior knowledge in latent domains, which could effectively guide the model
towards more effective learning of the original data distribution. Inspired by
this, we propose Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance (MDPG) provided by
pre-trained LDMs to enhance data consistency in MRI reconstruction tasks.
Specifically, we first construct a Visual-Mamba-based backbone, which enables
efficient encoding and reconstruction of under-sampled images. Then pre-trained
LDMs are integrated to provide conditional priors in both latent and image
domains. A novel Latent Guided Attention (LGA) is proposed for efficient fusion
in multi-level latent domains. Simultaneously, to effectively utilize a prior
in both the k-space and image domain, under-sampled images are fused with
generated full-sampled images by the Dual-domain Fusion Branch (DFB) for
self-adaption guidance. Lastly, to further enhance the data consistency, we
propose a k-space regularization strategy based on the non-auto-calibration
signal (NACS) set. Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets fully
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The code is
available at https://github.com/Zolento/MDPG.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is widely accessible and radiation-free but has a steep
learning curve due to its dynamic nature and non-standard imaging planes.
Additionally, the constant need to shift focus between the US screen and the
patient poses a challenge. To address these issues, we integrate deep learning
(DL)-based semantic segmentation for real-time (RT) automated kidney volumetric
measurements, which are essential for clinical assessment but are traditionally
time-consuming and prone to fatigue. This automation allows clinicians to
concentrate on image interpretation rather than manual measurements.
Complementing DL, augmented reality (AR) enhances the usability of US by
projecting the display directly into the clinician's field of view, improving
ergonomics and reducing the cognitive load associated with screen-to-patient
transitions. Two AR-DL-assisted US pipelines on HoloLens-2 are proposed: one
streams directly via the application programming interface for a wireless
setup, while the other supports any US device with video output for broader
accessibility. We evaluate RT feasibility and accuracy using the Open Kidney
Dataset and open-source segmentation models (nnU-Net, Segmenter, YOLO with
MedSAM and LiteMedSAM). Our open-source GitHub pipeline includes model
implementations, measurement algorithms, and a Wi-Fi-based streaming solution,
enhancing US training and diagnostics, especially in point-of-care settings.

Result: 提升了模型在各手术站点的适应性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedST有效结合手术领域知识，显著提升了联邦学习下的手术器械分割性能。

Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising
direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the
model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works
in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider
inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show
diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation;
ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data
generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized
FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST),
which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and
global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a
Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site
training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to
encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized
globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including
the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel
selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating
model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose
Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an
explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model
convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.

Abstract: This study proposes an algorithm based on a notch filter camera array system
for simultaneous super-resolution imaging and spectral reconstruction,
enhancing the spatial resolution and multispectral imaging capabilities of

pan-sharpening techniques, and spectral reconstruction algorithms were
investigated and integrated. The sub-pixel level offset information and
spectral disparities among the 9 low-resolution images captured by the 9
distinct imaging apertures were utilized, leading to the successful
reconstruction of 31 super-resolution spectral images. By conducting
simulations with a publicly available dataset and performing qualitative and
quantitative comparisons with snapshot coded aperture spectral imaging systems,
the experimental results demonstrate that our system and algorithm attained a
peak signal-to-noise ratio of 35.6dB, representing a 5dB enhancement over the

reducing processing time. This research offers an effective solution for

Method: 训练了四种深度学习模型，分别用于对比校正、呼吸运动校正、超分辨率和心脏结构分割。在10名患者中验证了该方法。

Result: 所有实时数据均成功转换为3D电影数据集，处理时间短，与常规成像结果吻合良好。

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著缩短CMR检查时间，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Background: Conventional cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in
paediatric and congenital heart disease uses 2D, breath-hold, balanced steady
state free precession (bSSFP) cine imaging for assessment of function and
cardiac-gated, respiratory-navigated, static 3D bSSFP whole-heart imaging for
anatomical assessment. Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing
real-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully
segmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were
trained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;
b) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice
direction); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,
RV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients
undergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on
prospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative
metrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D
cines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.
Results: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a
total post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant
biases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and
correlation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,
although there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from
concatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models. Our method
has short acquisition and reconstruction times with fully segmented data being
available within 2 minutes. The good agreement with conventional imaging
suggests that our method could help to significantly speed up CMR in clinical
practice.

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，FedCLAM在医学分割任务中优于八种前沿方法。

Conclusion: FedCLAM有效解决了医学影像联邦学习中的特征差异问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized training approach that keeps data under
stakeholder control while achieving superior performance over isolated
training. While inter-institutional feature discrepancies pose a challenge in
all federated settings, medical imaging is particularly affected due to diverse
imaging devices and population variances, which can diminish the global model's
effectiveness. Existing aggregation methods generally fail to adapt across
varied circumstances. To address this, we propose FedCLAM, which integrates
\textit{client-adaptive momentum} terms derived from each client's loss
reduction during local training, as well as a \textit{personalized dampening
factor} to curb overfitting. We further introduce a novel \textit{intensity
alignment} loss that matches predicted and ground-truth foreground
distributions to handle heterogeneous image intensity profiles across
institutions and devices. Extensive evaluations on two datasets show that
FedCLAM surpasses eight cutting-edge methods in medical segmentation tasks,
underscoring its efficacy. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents an FeFET-based active pixel sensor that performs
in-sensor multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations by leveraging the
multi-domain polarization states of ferroelectric layers. The proposed design
integrates a programmable FeFET into a 3-transistor pixel circuit, where the
FeFET's non-volatile conductance encodes the weight, and the photodiode voltage
drop encodes the input. Their interaction generates an output current
proportional to the product, enabling in-pixel analog multiplication.
Accumulation is achieved by summing output currents along shared column lines,
realizing full MAC functionality within the image sensor array. Extensive
HSPICE simulations, using 45 nm CMOS models, validate the operation and confirm
the scalability of the design. This compact and power-efficient architecture
minimizes data movement, making it ideal for real-time edge computing,
neuromorphic vision, and secure sensing applications.

2025 Grand Challenge on Generalizable HDR and SDR Video Quality Measurement.
With the rapid development of video technology, especially High Dynamic Range
(HDR) and Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) contents, the need for robust and
generalizable Video Quality Assessment (VQA) methods has become increasingly
demanded. Existing VQA models often struggle to deliver consistent performance
across varying dynamic ranges, distortion types, and diverse content. This
challenge was established to benchmark and promote VQA approaches capable of
jointly handling HDR and SDR content. In the final evaluation phase, five teams
submitted seven models along with technical reports to the Full Reference (FR)
and No Reference (NR) tracks. Among them, four methods outperformed VMAF
baseline, while the top-performing model achieved state-of-the-art performance,
setting a new benchmark for generalizable video quality assessment.

Conclusion: CA-Diff通过有效利用解剖特征，显著提升了脑MRI分割的准确性。

Abstract: Segmentation of brain structures from MRI is crucial for evaluating brain
morphology, yet existing CNN and transformer-based methods struggle to
delineate complex structures accurately. While current diffusion models have
shown promise in image segmentation, they are inadequate when applied directly
to brain MRI due to neglecting anatomical information. To address this, we
propose Collaborative Anatomy Diffusion (CA-Diff), a framework integrating
spatial anatomical features to enhance segmentation accuracy of the diffusion
model. Specifically, we introduce distance field as an auxiliary anatomical
condition to provide global spatial context, alongside a collaborative
diffusion process to model its joint distribution with anatomical structures,
enabling effective utilization of anatomical features for segmentation.
Furthermore, we introduce a consistency loss to refine relationships between
the distance field and anatomical structures and design a time adapted channel
attention module to enhance the U-Net feature fusion procedure. Extensive
experiments show that CA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Conclusion: HST为大脑动态表征提供了新框架，有助于分析大脑的亚稳态。

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, particularly in
capturing how the brain transitions between various functional states.
Recently, metastability, which refers to temporarily stable brain states, has
offered a promising paradigm to quantify complex brain signals into
interpretable, discretized representations. In particular, compared to
cluster-based machine learning approaches, tokenization approaches leveraging
vector quantization have shown promise in representation learning with powerful
reconstruction and predictive capabilities. However, most existing methods
ignore brain transition dependencies and lack a quantification of brain
dynamics into representative and stable embeddings. In this study, we propose a
Hierarchical State space-based Tokenization network, termed HST, which
quantizes brain states and transitions in a hierarchical structure based on a
state space-based model. We introduce a refined clustered Vector-Quantization
Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) that incorporates quantization error feedback
and clustering to improve quantization performance while facilitating
metastability with representative and stable token representations. We validate
our HST on two public fMRI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in
quantifying the hierarchical dynamics of the brain and its potential in disease
diagnosis and reconstruction performance. Our method offers a promising
framework for the characterization of brain dynamics, facilitating the analysis
of metastability.

tilt also considering different surrounding illuminations like ambient light
and no light conditions to estimate the blur levels in S2SVLC. In this
experimental investigation two types of coding, American Standard code for
information interchange (ASCII), and quick response (QR) code are used for data
transmission in S2SVLC. The obtained results indicate that, the proposed
technique is proven to improve the recovery efficiency to 96% in the receiver
end at different conditions.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局特征，难以捕捉区域特异性细节，可能导致某些异常被忽略。

Method: 1. 引入区域代表性令牌池化（R^2 Token Pooling）提取3D CT特征；2. 使用通用分割模型生成伪掩码并提取区域特征；3. 利用分割结果提取患者特定属性并转换为文本提示。

Result: 在RadGenome-Chest CT上，MedRegion-CT在自然语言生成质量和临床相关性方面表现最佳，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: MedRegion-CT通过区域聚焦方法显著提升了CT报告生成的性能，代码已公开。

Abstract: The recent release of RadGenome-Chest CT has significantly advanced CT-based
report generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on global
features, making it challenging to capture region-specific details, which may
cause certain abnormalities to go unnoticed. To address this, we propose
MedRegion-CT, a region-focused Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM)
framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce Region
Representative ($R^2$) Token Pooling, which utilizes a 2D-wise pretrained
vision model to efficiently extract 3D CT features. This approach generates
global tokens representing overall slice features and region tokens
highlighting target areas, enabling the MLLM to process comprehensive
information effectively. Second, a universal segmentation model generates
pseudo-masks, which are then processed by a mask encoder to extract
region-centric features. This allows the MLLM to focus on clinically relevant
regions, using six predefined region masks. Third, we leverage segmentation
results to extract patient-specific attributions, including organ size,
diameter, and locations. These are converted into text prompts, enriching the
MLLM's understanding of patient-specific contexts. To ensure rigorous
evaluation, we conducted benchmark experiments on report generation using the
RadGenome-Chest CT. MedRegion-CT achieved state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing methods in natural language generation quality and
clinical relevance while maintaining interpretability. The code for our
framework is publicly available.

Motivation: 当前多器官分割模型存在细节不准确、依赖几何提示和空间信息丢失的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Result: 在七个公共数据集上的实验表明，CRISP-SAM2优于现有模型。

Conclusion: CRISP-SAM2在解决多器官分割的局限性方面表现出色，具有优越性能。

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image
processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop
effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current
multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,
dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing
these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal
Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a
promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual
descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual
inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive
cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into
the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.
To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting
strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of
challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy
for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical
imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on
seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models.
Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby
confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations
mentioned earlier. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色缺乏特异性标记，而IHC染色受限于组织可用性和抗体特异性，虚拟染色技术有望高效生成IHC图像，但现有方法存在分解、可控性和一致性建模的不足。

Method: 设计了全局互信息引导的能量函数、时间步定制的反向扩散过程以及局部互信息驱动的对比学习策略，以分解染色风格与组织结构、精确控制染色强度并确保细胞级结构一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有技术，展示了其生物医学应用潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在虚拟染色任务中表现出色，代码将在接受后开源。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining visualizes histology but lacks
specificity for diagnostic markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
provides protein-targeted staining but is restricted by tissue availability and
antibody specificity. Virtual staining, i.e., computationally translating the
H&E image to its IHC counterpart while preserving the tissue structure, is
promising for efficient IHC generation. Existing virtual staining methods still
face key challenges: 1) effective decomposition of staining style and tissue
structure, 2) controllable staining process adaptable to diverse tissue and
proteins, and 3) rigorous structural consistency modelling to handle the
non-pixel-aligned nature of paired H&E and IHC images. This study proposes a
mutual-information (MI)-guided score-based diffusion model for unpaired virtual
staining. Specifically, we design 1) a global MI-guided energy function that
disentangles the tissue structure and staining characteristics across
modalities, 2) a novel timestep-customized reverse diffusion process for
precise control of the staining intensity and structural reconstruction, and 3)
a local MI-driven contrastive learning strategy to ensure the cellular level
structural consistency between H&E-IHC images. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its biomedical potential. Codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多源数据中因成像协议、扫描仪和患者群体差异导致的域偏移问题。

Method: 采用Variance Risk Extrapolation (VREx)减少域间风险差异，并应用Mixup数据增强提升泛化能力。

Result: 在验证集上平均宏F1分数为0.96，表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 结合VREx和Mixup的方法在多源COVID-19检测任务中效果显著。

Abstract: We present our solution for the Multi-Source COVID-19 Detection Challenge,
which aims to classify chest CT scans into COVID and Non-COVID categories
across data collected from four distinct hospitals and medical centers. A major
challenge in this task lies in the domain shift caused by variations in imaging
protocols, scanners, and patient populations across institutions. To enhance
the cross-domain generalization of our model, we incorporate Variance Risk
Extrapolation (VREx) into the training process. VREx encourages the model to
maintain consistent performance across multiple source domains by explicitly
minimizing the variance of empirical risks across environments. This
regularization strategy reduces overfitting to center-specific features and
promotes learning of domain-invariant representations. We further apply Mixup
data augmentation to improve generalization and robustness. Mixup interpolates
both the inputs and labels of randomly selected pairs of training samples,
encouraging the model to behave linearly between examples and enhancing its
resilience to noise and limited data. Our method achieves an average macro F1
score of 0.96 across the four sources on the validation set, demonstrating
strong generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种生理感知的ECG合成和预训练方法，用于提高心肌梗死（MI）检测的准确性，尤其是在数据有限的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心肌梗死是全球主要死因之一，早期准确诊断至关重要。深度学习模型需要大量标记数据，但实际中数据稀缺。

Method: 提出一种方法：（1）合成可调MI形态和真实噪声的12导联ECG；（2）通过自监督掩码自编码和联合重建-分类目标预训练模型。

Result: 合成ECG保留了关键形态特征，预训练在低数据环境下显著提升分类性能，AUC最高提升4个百分点。

Conclusion: 合成ECG可有效改善MI检测，尤其在临床数据有限时。

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a major cause of death globally, and accurate early
diagnosis from electrocardiograms (ECGs) remains a clinical priority. Deep
learning models have shown promise for automated ECG interpretation, but
require large amounts of labeled data, which are often scarce in practice. We
propose a physiology-aware pipeline that (i) synthesizes 12-lead ECGs with
tunable MI morphology and realistic noise, and (ii) pre-trains recurrent and
transformer classifiers with self-supervised masked-autoencoding plus a joint
reconstruction-classification objective. We validate the realism of synthetic
ECGs via statistical and visual analysis, confirming that key morphological
features are preserved. Pretraining on synthetic data consistently improved
classification performance, particularly in low-data settings, with AUC gains
of up to 4 percentage points. These results show that controlled synthetic ECGs
can help improve MI detection when real clinical data is limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在医学图像分析中具有巨大潜力，但其预测的准确性和校准误差在不同人口亚组中的表现需要深入分析，以确保安全部署到临床实践中。

Method: 提出CALIN方法，通过双层程序（从群体水平到亚组水平）估计校准需求，并在推理时应用校准矩阵调整预测置信度。

Result: 在三个医学影像数据集上的实验表明，CALIN能有效实现公平的置信度校准，同时提高整体预测准确性，且公平性与效用之间的权衡最小。

Conclusion: CALIN是一种有效的推理时校准方法，能够减少MLLMs在医学图像分类中的校准偏差和人口统计学不公平性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enormous potential to perform
few-shot in-context learning in the context of medical image analysis. However,
safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an
in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated
calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In
this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and
demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot
in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an
inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases.
Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by
calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the
population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this
estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference.
Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image
classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for
chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair
confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall
prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication among preterm
neonates, with portable X-ray imaging serving as the standard diagnostic
modality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). However, lung magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive alternative that avoids sedation
and radiation while providing detailed insights into the underlying mechanisms
of BPD. Leveraging high-resolution 3D MRI data, advanced image processing and
semantic segmentation algorithms can be developed to assist clinicians in
identifying the etiology of BPD. In this dataset, we present MRI scans paired
with corresponding semantic segmentations of the lungs and trachea for 40
neonates, the majority of whom are diagnosed with BPD. The imaging data consist
of free-breathing 3D stack-of-stars radial gradient echo acquisitions, known as
the StarVIBE series. Additionally, we provide comprehensive clinical data and
baseline segmentation models, validated against clinical assessments, to
support further research and development in neonatal lung imaging.

Abstract: In contemporary surgical research and practice, accurately comprehending 3D
surgical scenes with text-promptable capabilities is particularly crucial for
surgical planning and real-time intra-operative guidance, where precisely
identifying and interacting with surgical tools and anatomical structures is
paramount. However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model
(VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for
real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a
novel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce
a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything
model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented
language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more
in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose
semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of
semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and
semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization,
which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training,
particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to
demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves
the way for developing next-generation intelligent surgical systems by
enhancing surgical precision and safety. Our code is available at:

Abstract: We introduce MRF-DiPh, a novel physics informed denoising diffusion approach
for multiparametric tissue mapping from highly accelerated, transient-state
quantitative MRI acquisitions like Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF). Our
method is derived from a proximal splitting formulation, incorporating a
pretrained denoising diffusion model as an effective image prior to regularize
the MRF inverse problem. Further, during reconstruction it simultaneously
enforces two key physical constraints: (1) k-space measurement consistency and
(2) adherence to the Bloch response model. Numerical experiments on in-vivo
brain scans data show that MRF-DiPh outperforms deep learning and compressed
sensing MRF baselines, providing more accurate parameter maps while better
preserving measurement fidelity and physical model consistency-critical for
solving reliably inverse problems in medical imaging.

Method: 使用两种类特定的深度卷积生成对抗网络（DCGAN）生成合成图像，并在三个公开乳腺超声数据集上模拟联邦学习环境，采用FedAvg和FedProx作为基线算法。

Result: 实验表明，适量合成图像将FedAvg的AUC从0.9206提升至0.9237，FedProx的AUC从0.9429提升至0.9538，但过量合成数据会降低性能。

Conclusion: 生成AI数据增强能有效提升联邦学习在乳腺超声分类任务中的表现，但需平衡真实与合成数据的比例。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without
exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered
by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data
across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based
data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the
federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images.
Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative
Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then
simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast
ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are
adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating
a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to
0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that
excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the
importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our
findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to
enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

models has been a promising approach for image generation. Nevertheless,
existing methods exhibit limitations in preserving finegrained image details.
To address this issue, frequency domain-directed diffusion transformer (FD-DiT)
is proposed for LDCT reconstruction. FD-DiT centers on a diffusion strategy
that progressively introduces noise until the distribution statistically aligns
with that of LDCT data, followed by denoising processing. Furthermore, we
employ a frequency decoupling technique to concentrate noise primarily in
high-frequency domain, thereby facilitating effective capture of essential
anatomical structures and fine details. A hybrid denoising network is then
utilized to optimize the overall data reconstruction process. To enhance the
capability in recognizing high-frequency noise, we incorporate sliding sparse
local attention to leverage the sparsity and locality of shallow-layer
information, propagating them via skip connections for improving feature
representation. Finally, we propose a learnable dynamic fusion strategy for
optimal component integration. Experimental results demonstrate that at
identical dose levels, LDCT images reconstructed by FD-DiT exhibit superior
noise and artifact suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Echocardiography is routine for cardiac examination. However, 2D ultrasound
(US) struggles with accurate metric calculation and direct observation of 3D
cardiac structures. Moreover, 3D US is limited by low resolution, small field
of view and scarce availability in practice. Constructing the cardiac
anatomical twin from 2D images is promising to provide precise treatment
planning and clinical quantification. However, it remains challenging due to
the rare paired data, complex structures, and US noises. In this study, we
introduce a novel generative framework UltraTwin, to obtain cardiac anatomical
twin from sparse multi-view 2D US. Our contribution is three-fold. First,
pioneered the construction of a real-world and high-quality dataset containing
strictly paired multi-view 2D US and CT, and pseudo-paired data. Second, we
propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to achieve hierarchical reconstruction
optimization. Last, we introduce an implicit autoencoder for topology-aware
constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraTwin reconstructs
high-quality anatomical twins versus strong competitors. We believe it advances
anatomical twin modeling for potential applications in personalized cardiac
care.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于人工智能的像素级肺部评分（APL）方法，用于快速准确评估囊性纤维化（CF）患者的肺部结构损伤，相比传统网格级评分更快且更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于MRI无电离辐射，在儿科疾病（如囊性纤维化）中优于CT，但缺乏定量评分系统。APL评分旨在填补这一空白。

Method: APL评分包括五个步骤：图像加载、AI肺部分割、切片采样、像素级标注及量化报告。

Result: APL评分耗时8.2分钟/例，比网格级评分快两倍，且准确性更高（p=0.021），相关性显著（R=0.973）。

Conclusion: APL评分有望优化临床工作流程，并扩展至其他肺部疾病和MRI序列。

Abstract: Lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ultrashort echo-time (UTE)
represents a recent breakthrough in lung structure imaging, providing image
resolution and quality comparable to computed tomography (CT). Due to the
absence of ionising radiation, MRI is often preferred over CT in paediatric
diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common genetic disorders
in Caucasians. To assess structural lung damage in CF imaging, CT scoring
systems provide valuable quantitative insights for disease diagnosis and
progression. However, few quantitative scoring systems are available in
structural lung MRI (e.g., UTE-MRI). To provide fast and accurate
quantification in lung MRI, we investigated the feasibility of novel Artificial
intelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) scoring for CF. APL scoring
consists of 5 stages, including 1) image loading, 2) AI lung segmentation, 3)
lung-bounded slice sampling, 4) pixel-level annotation, and 5) quantification
and reporting. The results shows that our APL scoring took 8.2 minutes per
subject, which was more than twice as fast as the previous grid-level scoring.
Additionally, our pixel-level scoring was statistically more accurate
(p=0.021), while strongly correlating with grid-level scoring (R=0.973,
p=5.85e-9). This tool has great potential to streamline the workflow of UTE
lung MRI in clinical settings, and be extended to other structural lung MRI
sequences (e.g., BLADE MRI), and for other lung diseases (e.g.,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia).

TL;DR: AFUNet通过交替优化的对齐与融合任务，基于MAP估计理论，显著提升了HDR图像重建的性能。

Motivation: 现有方法依赖经验设计，缺乏理论支持，影响可靠性。

Method: 提出AFUNet，将HDR重建分解为对齐与融合子任务，通过交替优化和展开迭代实现。

Result: AFUNet在定性和定量评估中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AFUNet通过理论驱动的设计，实现了高性能的HDR重建。

Abstract: Existing learning-based methods effectively reconstruct HDR images from
multi-exposure LDR inputs with extended dynamic range and improved detail, but
they rely more on empirical design rather than theoretical foundation, which
can impact their reliability. To address these limitations, we propose the
cross-iterative Alignment and Fusion deep Unfolding Network (AFUNet), where HDR
reconstruction is systematically decoupled into two interleaved subtasks --
alignment and fusion -- optimized through alternating refinement, achieving
synergy between the two subtasks to enhance the overall performance. Our method
formulates multi-exposure HDR reconstruction from a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
estimation perspective, explicitly incorporating spatial correspondence priors
across LDR images and naturally bridging the alignment and fusion subproblems
through joint constraints. Building on the mathematical foundation, we
reimagine traditional iterative optimization through unfolding -- transforming
the conventional solution process into an end-to-end trainable AFUNet with
carefully designed modules that work progressively. Specifically, each
iteration of AFUNet incorporates an Alignment-Fusion Module (AFM) that
alternates between a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) for alignment and a Channel
Fusion Module (CFM) for adaptive feature fusion, progressively bridging
misaligned content and exposure discrepancies. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate AFUNet's superior performance,
consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Generating radiology reports from CT scans remains a complex task due to the
nuanced nature of medical imaging and the variability in clinical
documentation. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework for generating
renal radiology reports from 2D CT slices. First, we extract structured
abnormality features using a multi-task learning model trained to identify
lesion attributes such as location, size, enhancement, and attenuation. These
extracted features are subsequently combined with the corresponding CT image
and fed into a fine-tuned vision-language model to generate natural language
report sentences aligned with clinical findings. We conduct experiments on a
curated dataset of renal CT studies with manually annotated
sentence-slice-feature triplets and evaluate performance using both
classification metrics and natural language generation metrics. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms random baselines across all
abnormality types, and the generated reports capture key clinical content with
reasonable textual accuracy. This exploratory work highlights the feasibility
of modular, feature-informed report generation for renal imaging. Future
efforts will focus on extending this pipeline to 3D CT volumes and further
improving clinical fidelity in multimodal medical AI systems.

Abstract: Medical image data is less accessible than in other domains due to privacy
and regulatory constraints. In addition, labeling requires costly,
time-intensive manual image annotation by clinical experts. To overcome these
challenges, synthetic medical data generation offers a promising solution.
Generative AI (GenAI), employing generative deep learning models, has proven
effective at producing realistic synthetic images. This study proposes a novel
mask-guided GenAI approach using diffusion models to generate synthetic fetal
head ultrasound images paired with segmentation masks. These synthetic pairs
augment real datasets for supervised fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). Our results show that the synthetic data captures real image features
effectively, and this approach reaches state-of-the-art fetal head
segmentation, especially when trained with a limited number of real image-mask
pairs. In particular, the segmentation reaches Dice Scores of 94.66\% and
94.38\% using a handful of ultrasound images from the Spanish and African
cohorts, respectively. Our code, models, and data are available on GitHub.

Result: 在多个数据集上，GUSL在前列腺和区域分割任务中达到最佳性能，DSC超过0.9，模型更小且更节能。

Conclusion: GUSL提供了一种轻量、高效且透明的解决方案，适用于医学图像分割应用。

Abstract: Prostate and zonal segmentation is a crucial step for clinical diagnosis of
prostate cancer (PCa). Computer-aided diagnosis tools for prostate segmentation
are based on the deep learning (DL) paradigm. However, deep neural networks are
perceived as "black-box" solutions by physicians, thus making them less
practical for deployment in the clinical setting. In this paper, we introduce a
feed-forward machine learning model, named Green U-shaped Learning (GUSL),
suitable for medical image segmentation without backpropagation. GUSL
introduces a multi-layer regression scheme for coarse-to-fine segmentation. Its
feature extraction is based on a linear model, which enables seamless
interpretability during feature extraction. Also, GUSL introduces a mechanism
for attention on the prostate boundaries, which is an error-prone region, by
employing regression to refine the predictions through residue correction. In
addition, a two-step pipeline approach is used to mitigate the class imbalance,
an issue inherent in medical imaging problems. After conducting experiments on
two publicly available datasets and one private dataset, in both prostate gland
and zonal segmentation tasks, GUSL achieves state-of-the-art performance among
other DL-based models. Notably, GUSL features a very energy-efficient pipeline,
since it has a model size several times smaller and less complexity than the
rest of the solutions. In all datasets, GUSL achieved a Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC) performance greater than $0.9$ for gland segmentation.
Considering also its lightweight model size and transparency in feature
extraction, it offers a competitive and practical package for medical imaging
applications.

Conclusion: MedSAM-CA在低资源临床场景中表现出色，显著减少标注需求并提升分割精度。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning, where accurate boundary delineation is essential for
precise lesion localization, organ identification, and quantitative assessment.
In recent years, deep learning-based methods have significantly advanced
segmentation accuracy. However, two major challenges remain. First, the
performance of these methods heavily relies on large-scale annotated datasets,
which are often difficult to obtain in medical scenarios due to privacy
concerns and high annotation costs. Second, clinically challenging scenarios,
such as low contrast in certain imaging modalities and blurry lesion boundaries
caused by malignancy, still pose obstacles to precise segmentation. To address
these challenges, we propose MedSAM-CA, an architecture-level fine-tuning
approach that mitigates reliance on extensive manual annotations by adapting
the pretrained foundation model, Medical Segment Anything (MedSAM). MedSAM-CA
introduces two key components: the Convolutional Attention-Enhanced Boundary
Refinement Network (CBR-Net) and the Attention-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block
(Atte-FFB). CBR-Net operates in parallel with the MedSAM encoder to recover
boundary information potentially overlooked by long-range attention mechanisms,
leveraging hierarchical convolutional processing. Atte-FFB, embedded in the
MedSAM decoder, fuses multi-level fine-grained features from skip connections
in CBR-Net with global representations upsampled within the decoder to enhance
boundary delineation accuracy. Experiments on publicly available datasets
covering dermoscopy, CT, and MRI imaging modalities validate the effectiveness
of MedSAM-CA. On dermoscopy dataset, MedSAM-CA achieves 94.43% Dice with only
2% of full training data, reaching 97.25% of full-data training performance,
demonstrating strong effectiveness in low-resource clinical settings.

Result: 在两个公开MRI数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MDPG通过多域先验引导和k空间正则化，显著提升了MRI重建的数据一致性和图像质量。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is essential in medical
diagnostics. As the latest generative models, diffusion models (DMs) have
struggled to produce high-fidelity images due to their stochastic nature in
image domains. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) yield both compact and detailed
prior knowledge in latent domains, which could effectively guide the model
towards more effective learning of the original data distribution. Inspired by
this, we propose Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance (MDPG) provided by
pre-trained LDMs to enhance data consistency in MRI reconstruction tasks.
Specifically, we first construct a Visual-Mamba-based backbone, which enables
efficient encoding and reconstruction of under-sampled images. Then pre-trained
LDMs are integrated to provide conditional priors in both latent and image
domains. A novel Latent Guided Attention (LGA) is proposed for efficient fusion
in multi-level latent domains. Simultaneously, to effectively utilize a prior
in both the k-space and image domain, under-sampled images are fused with
generated full-sampled images by the Dual-domain Fusion Branch (DFB) for
self-adaption guidance. Lastly, to further enhance the data consistency, we
propose a k-space regularization strategy based on the non-auto-calibration
signal (NACS) set. Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets fully
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The code is
available at https://github.com/Zolento/MDPG.

Conclusion: 该技术提高了超声检查的效率和诊断准确性，特别适用于即时护理场景。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is widely accessible and radiation-free but has a steep
learning curve due to its dynamic nature and non-standard imaging planes.
Additionally, the constant need to shift focus between the US screen and the
patient poses a challenge. To address these issues, we integrate deep learning
(DL)-based semantic segmentation for real-time (RT) automated kidney volumetric
measurements, which are essential for clinical assessment but are traditionally
time-consuming and prone to fatigue. This automation allows clinicians to
concentrate on image interpretation rather than manual measurements.
Complementing DL, augmented reality (AR) enhances the usability of US by
projecting the display directly into the clinician's field of view, improving
ergonomics and reducing the cognitive load associated with screen-to-patient
transitions. Two AR-DL-assisted US pipelines on HoloLens-2 are proposed: one
streams directly via the application programming interface for a wireless
setup, while the other supports any US device with video output for broader
accessibility. We evaluate RT feasibility and accuracy using the Open Kidney
Dataset and open-source segmentation models (nnU-Net, Segmenter, YOLO with
MedSAM and LiteMedSAM). Our open-source GitHub pipeline includes model
implementations, measurement algorithms, and a Wi-Fi-based streaming solution,
enhancing US training and diagnostics, especially in point-of-care settings.

Conclusion: FedST通过结合手术领域知识，显著提升了联邦学习在手术器械分割中的表现。

Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising
direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the
model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works
in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider
inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show
diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation;
ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data
generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized
FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST),
which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and
global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a
Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site
training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to
encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized
globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including
the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel
selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating
model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose
Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an
explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model
convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.

spectral disparities among the 9 low-resolution images captured by the 9

reconstruction of 31 super-resolution spectral images. By conducting
simulations with a publicly available dataset and performing qualitative and
quantitative comparisons with snapshot coded aperture spectral imaging systems,
the experimental results demonstrate that our system and algorithm attained a
peak signal-to-noise ratio of 35.6dB, representing a 5dB enhancement over the
