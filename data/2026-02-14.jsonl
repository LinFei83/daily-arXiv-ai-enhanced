In contrast, studies targeting the coding-structure level - especially the analysis of block-level steganographic behaviors in Coding Units (CUs) - remain at an early stage. As a core component of H.265/HEVC coding decisions, the CU partition structure often exhibits steganographic perturbations in the form of structural changes and reorganization of prediction relationships, which are difficult to characterize effectively using traditional pixel-domain features or mode statistics. To address this issue, this paper, for the first time from the perspective of CU block-level steganalysis, proposes an H.265/HEVC video steganalysis method based on CU block-structure gradients and intra prediction mode mapping. The proposed method constructs a CU block-structure gradient map to explicitly describe changes in coding-unit partitioning, and combines it with a block-level mapping representation of IPM to jointly model the structural perturbations introduced by CU-level steganographic embedding. On this basis, we design a Transformer network, GradIPMFormer, tailored for CU-block steganalysis, thereby effectively enhancing the capability to perceive CU-level steganographic behaviors. Experimental results show that under different quantization parameters and resolution settings, the proposed method consistently achieves superior detection performance across multiple H.265/HEVC steganographic algorithms, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of conducting video steganalysis from the coding-structure perspective. This study provides a new CU block-level analysis paradigm for H.265/HEVC video steganalysis and has significant research value for covert communication security detection."}

This yields a stochastic guidance law complying with the generalized separation theorem, as opposed to the common approach, that implicitly, but unjustifiably, assumes the validity of the regular separation theorem. The required posterior probability density function of the game's state is derived from the available noisy measurements using an interacting multiple model particle filter. When the resulting optimal decision turns out to be nonunique, this feature is harnessed to appropriately shape the trajectory of the pursuer so as to enhance its estimator's performance. In addition, certain properties of the particle-based computation of the Bayesian cost are exploited to render the algorithm amenable to real-time implementation. The performance of the entire estimation-decision-guidance scheme is demonstrated using an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study."}

Akan"], "title": "Chemo Hydrodynamic Transceivers for the Internet of Bio-Nano Things, Modeling the Joint Propulsion Transmission trade-off", "comment": "11 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "The Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) requires mobile nanomachines that navigate complex fluids while exchanging molecular signals under external supervision. We introduce the chemo-hydrodynamic transceiver, a unified model for catalytic Janus particles in which an external optical control simultaneously drives molecular emission and active self-propulsion. Unlike common abstractions that decouple mobility and communication, we derive a stochastic channel model that captures their physicochemical coupling and shows that actuation-induced distance jitter can dominate the received-signal variance, yielding a fundamental trade-off: stronger actuation increases emission but can sharply reduce reliability through motion-induced fading. Numerical results reveal a unimodal reliability profile with a critical actuation level beyond which the signal-to-noise ratio collapses, and an optimal control level that scales approximately linearly with link distance. Compared with Brownian-mobility baselines, the model exposes a pronounced estimation gap: neglecting active motility noise can underestimate the bit error probability by orders of magnitude. These findings provide physical-layer guidelines for mobility-aware IoBNT protocol design and closed-loop control of nanorobotic swarms."}

Due to the inherent difference in short-circuit capacity contributions of synchronous generators and inverters, the short-circuit ratio is not a one-size-fit-all metric to assess the system strength. Following the distinct dynamic behavior of the IBR in small- and large-signal disturbance, the system strength is separated accordingly. To address the large-signal system strength assessment, a control type-dependent metric, Power Margin Ratio (PMR), is proposed in this paper. PMR is defined as the ratio between the maximum power that can be injected to the system without causing any instability and the nominal power of the IBR. It can be obtained via power flow calculation with a modified algorithm. The theoretical foundation of PMR is established from the viewpoint of dynamical systems. PMR is identical to SCR for the single-plant-infinite-bus system, while presents advancement for multi-infeed power systems. Comprehensive case studies and discussions have validated that PMR reveals the large-signal system strength from a static perspective."}

Notably, we first prove that for directed signed matrix-weighted networks, every eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacians has positive real part under certain conditions. This key finding ensures the global asymptotic convergence of systems states to the null spaces of signed matrix-weighted Laplacians, providing a foundational tool for analyzing dynamics on rooted signed matrix-weighted networks. To achieve non-trivial consensus, we propose a systematic approach involving the strategic selection of informed agents, careful design of external signals, and precise determination of coupling terms. Crucially, we derive the lower bounds of the coupling coefficients. Our consensus algorithm operates under milder connectivity conditions, and does not impose restrictions on whether the network is structurally balanced or unbalanced. Moreover, the non-trivial consensus state can be preset arbitrarily as needed. We also carry out the above analysis for undirected networks, with more relaxed conditions on the coupling coefficients comparing to the directed case. This paper further studies non-trivial consensus with switching topologies, and propose the necessary condition for the convergence of switching networks. The work in this paper demonstrates that groups with both cooperative and antagonistic multi-dimensional interactions can achieve consensus, which was previously deemed exclusive to fully cooperative groups."}

However, driven by cost minimization, OPF provides an ideal, albeit unrealistic, clearing of the generating units, disregarding the complex interactions among market participants. The security of the system, therefore, may be overestimated. To address this gap, we introduce a market model with a social-welfare-based day-ahead market clearing mechanism. The security implications are analyzed via Cascades, a cascading outage analysis framework. We apply this framework to the IEEE-118 bus system with three independent control zones. The results show that market dispatch leads to an increase in demand not served of up to 80% higher than OPF, highlighting a security overestimation. Operators can use this information to properly allocate reserves and perform efficient expansion planning strategies."}

This condition accommodates a broad range of nonlinear models in control and machine learning such as saturation functions, sigmoid, ReLU and tanh activation functions, and standard classification models. Without requiring any persistent excitation of the data, we establish global convergence of the proposed adaptive predictor and derive explicit rates for its asymptotic performance. Furthermore, under a classical nonlinear minimum-phase condition and with a linear growth bound on the nonlinearities, we establish the convergence rate of the resulting closed-loop control error. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive prediction algorithm on a real-world judicial sentencing dataset. The adaptive control performance will also be evaluated via a numerical simulation."}
