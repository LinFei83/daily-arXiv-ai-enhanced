### [1] [SAMEP: A Secure Protocol for Persistent Context Sharing Across AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10562)
*Hari Masoor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAMEP协议解决了AI代理间记忆共享的持久性、安全性和语义搜索问题，显著提升了协作效率和合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理架构存在记忆短暂性问题，限制了跨会话和代理边界的协作与知识共享。

Method: 提出SAMEP框架，结合分布式记忆存储、向量语义搜索、加密访问控制和标准化API。

Result: 实验显示减少了73%冗余计算，提升了89%上下文相关性，完全符合监管要求。

Conclusion: SAMEP为AI代理生态系统提供了持久、安全、协作的新范式。

Abstract: Current AI agent architectures suffer from ephemeral memory limitations,
preventing effective collaboration and knowledge sharing across sessions and
agent boundaries. We introduce SAMEP (Secure Agent Memory Exchange Protocol), a
novel framework that enables persistent, secure, and semantically searchable
memory sharing among AI agents. Our protocol addresses three critical
challenges: (1) persistent context preservation across agent sessions, (2)
secure multi-agent collaboration with fine-grained access control, and (3)
efficient semantic discovery of relevant historical context. SAMEP implements a
distributed memory repository with vector-based semantic search, cryptographic
access controls (AES-256-GCM), and standardized APIs compatible with existing
agent communication protocols (MCP, A2A). We demonstrate SAMEP's effectiveness
across diverse domains including multi-agent software development, healthcare
AI with HIPAA compliance, and multi-modal processing pipelines. Experimental
results show 73% reduction in redundant computations, 89% improvement in
context relevance scores, and complete compliance with regulatory requirements
including audit trail generation. SAMEP enables a new paradigm of persistent,
collaborative AI agent ecosystems while maintaining security and privacy
guarantees.

### [2] [AI Mother Tongue: Self-Emergent Communication in MARL via Endogenous Symbol Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10566)
*Hung Ming Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于VQ-VAE的"AI Mother Tongue"框架，证明在去中心化MARL中，无需外部归纳偏置，代理的内生符号系统可实现有效通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法因"联合探索困境"导致的"通信真空均衡"问题，质疑人工归纳偏置是否过度设计。

Method: 采用VQ-VAE框架，通过内生符号系统实现语义压缩与纳什均衡驱动的语义收敛。

Result: AIM框架展现出更强的泛化性与效率，符号使用符合幂律分布，并提出了三个理论见解。

Conclusion: 研究为符号主义与连接主义的结合提供了新思路，未来将探索HQ-VAE增强表达能力和RL低层预训练。

Abstract: In Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), the development
of Emergent Communication has long been constrained by the ``Joint Exploration
Dilemma'', leading agents to fall into a ``Communication Vacuum Equilibrium'' .
Traditional methods address this by introducing inductive biases to facilitate
communication emergence . This study fundamentally questions whether such
artificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments
with the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized
Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an
endogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit
spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic
convergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external
inductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that
the human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and
resonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM
demonstrates stronger generality and efficiency. The interpretable analysis
toolkit developed in this study confirms that symbol usage exhibits a
significant power-law distribution, leading to three major theoretical
insights: the ``Neural Communication Hypothesis'', the ``Tool-First
Principle'', and the ``Semantic Interpretability Paradigm''. Future research
will explore the integration of Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders
(HQ-VAE) to enhance AIM's complex expressive capabilities and investigate the
potential for ``Reinforcement Learning (RL) Low-Level Pre-training''. This
discovery offers new avenues for bridging symbolism and connectionism.

### [3] [Orchestrator-Agent Trust: A Modular Agentic AI Visual Classification System with Trust-Aware Orchestration and RAG-Based Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10571)
*Konstantinos I. Roumeliotis,Ranjan Sapkota,Manoj Karkee,Nikolaos D. Tselikas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模块化的多智能体AI视觉分类框架，通过信任感知的协调和RAG模块，显著提升了零样本场景下的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体AI在零样本场景下的信任问题，特别是在视觉和语言理解结合的领域。

Method: 结合通用多模态智能体、非视觉推理协调器和RAG模块，通过置信度校准和图像检索优化信任分配。

Result: 零样本场景下准确率提升77.94%，总体准确率达到85.63%，并通过图像RAG纠正智能体的过度自信。

Conclusion: 该框架将感知与元推理分离，具有可扩展性和可解释性，适用于诊断、生物学等信任关键领域。

Abstract: Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent
architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing
challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot
settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual
classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a
non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three
configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II)
fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated
orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops.
Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator
modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy
improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG,
achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL
displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with
visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via
iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision
agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable
multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other
trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components
including the complete software source code are openly released to support
reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking at Github:

### [4] [Comprehension Without Competence: Architectural Limits of LLMs in Symbolic Computation and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10624)
*Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出大语言模型（LLM）在符号推理、算术准确性和逻辑一致性任务上存在系统性失败，揭示了其理解与能力之间的鸿沟，并提出“计算分裂脑综合征”作为解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在复杂任务中表现不佳的根本原因，揭示其表面流畅性背后的计算局限性。

Method: 通过控制实验和架构分析，研究LLM在任务中的表现，发现其原则表达与实际应用之间的脱节。

Result: LLM虽能表达正确原则，但无法可靠执行，原因是计算执行路径与指令路径的几何和功能分离。

Conclusion: LLM缺乏结构化推理能力，未来需改进模型架构，引入元认知控制和原则提升机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet
systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy,
and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such
failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and
\textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis,
we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably
applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational
execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain
syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and
functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from
mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model
behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs
function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural
scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the
boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with
metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution.
This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may
reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal
computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction
and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and
mechanistic analysis.

### [5] [Enhancing the Capabilities of Large Language Models for API calls through Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10630)
*Ye Yang,Xue Xiao,Ping Yin,Taotao Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KG2data结合知识图谱、LLMs、ReAct代理和工具使用技术，提升气象领域数据获取和查询的智能性，性能优于RAG2data和chat2data。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在知识密集型领域（如气象学）中通过API调用有效利用工具的能力尚未充分探索，且缺乏领域特定知识。

Method: KG2data整合知识图谱、LLMs、ReAct代理和工具使用技术，通过虚拟API评估API调用准确性。

Result: KG2data在名称识别失败（1.43%）、幻觉失败（0%）和调用正确性（88.57%）上表现优于对比系统。

Conclusion: KG2data为高知识需求领域提供了智能问答和数据分析的新解决方案，解决了LLMs领域知识不足的问题。

Abstract: API calls by large language models (LLMs) offer a cutting-edge approach for
data analysis. However, their ability to effectively utilize tools via API
calls remains underexplored in knowledge-intensive domains like meteorology.
This paper introduces KG2data, a system that integrates knowledge graphs, LLMs,
ReAct agents, and tool-use technologies to enable intelligent data acquisition
and query handling in the meteorological field. Using a virtual API, we
evaluate API call accuracy across three metrics: name recognition failure,
hallucination failure, and call correctness. KG2data achieves superior
performance (1.43%, 0%, 88.57%) compared to RAG2data (16%, 10%, 72.14%) and
chat2data (7.14%, 8.57%, 71.43%). KG2data differs from typical LLM-based
systems by addressing their limited access to domain-specific knowledge, which
hampers performance on complex or terminology-rich queries. By using a
knowledge graph as persistent memory, our system enhances content retrieval,
complex query handling, domain-specific reasoning, semantic relationship
resolution, and heterogeneous data integration. It also mitigates the high cost
of fine-tuning LLMs, making the system more adaptable to evolving domain
knowledge and API structures. In summary, KG2data provides a novel solution for
intelligent, knowledge-based question answering and data analysis in domains
with high knowledge demands.

### [6] [From Semantic Web and MAS to Agentic AI: A Unified Narrative of the Web of Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10644)
*Tatiana Petrova,Aleksandr Puzikov,Boris Bliznukov,Radu State*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文首次全面概述了Web of Agents（WoA）的演变，揭示了现代协议与早期标准的联系，并提出了一种四轴分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究WoA的分散性，整合多代理系统和语义Web的历史，以提供对该领域轨迹的整体理解。

Method: 引入四轴分类法（语义基础、通信范式、智能中心、发现机制）来系统比较不同世代的代理架构。

Result: 揭示了智能中心的范式转变，从外部数据或平台转移到代理核心模型（LLM），为现代Agentic AI奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 新协议虽重要，但不足以构建稳健、开放、可信的生态系统；未来研究应解决去中心化身份、经济模型、安全和治理等挑战。

Abstract: The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static,
document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users'
behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become
more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across
different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered
frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the
Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation
obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic
understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive
evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and
the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations
of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To
systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic
foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery
mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing
agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent
where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift
in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic
Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model
(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable
and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new
protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,
trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies
in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda
focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance
for the emerging WoA.

### [7] [Parsing Musical Structure to Enable Meaningful Variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10740)
*Maziar Kanani,Sean O Leary,James McDermott*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于规则的、通过变异现有曲调生成音乐的新方法，使用Sequitur算法解析曲调并构建语法，再对语法进行随机变异以生成新曲调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过变异现有曲调的语法结构来生成新的音乐，并分析变异对曲调的影响。

Method: 1. 使用Sequitur算法解析曲调，构建Pathway Assembly（PA）结构；2. 对语法进行随机变异（19种类型）；3. 扩展语法生成新曲调。

Result: 通过多次变异生成新曲调，分析变异对曲调编辑距离、结构复杂度和长度的影响，并评估每种变异类型的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法能够逐步改变曲调，生成与原始曲调相关的新音乐，但仅关注音高序列的生成。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel rule-based approach for generating music by
varying existing tunes. We parse each tune to find the Pathway Assembly (PA) [
1], that is a structure representing all repetitions in the tune. The Sequitur
algorithm [2 ] is used for this. The result is a grammar. We then carry out
mutation on the grammar, rather than on a tune directly. There are potentially
19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of
the grammar that can be applied to the grammars. The system employs one of the
mutations randomly in this step to automatically manipulate the grammar.
Following the mutation, we need to expand the grammar which returns a new tune.
The output after 1 or more mutations will be a new tune related to the original
tune. Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple
mutations. Edit distances, structural complexity and length of the tunes are
used to show how a tune is changed after multiple mutations. In addition, the
size of effect of each mutation type is analyzed. As a final point, we review
the musical aspect of the output tunes. It should be noted that the study only
focused on generating new pitch sequences. The study is based on an Irish
traditional tune dataset and a list of integers has been used to represent each
tune's pitch values.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI对数据中心能源消耗和温室气体排放的影响，分析了短期（2030年前）和长期（2035年后）的碳排放趋势，并评估AI是否对CO2排放有正面、中性或负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在各行业的广泛应用，数据中心的能源消耗和碳排放问题日益突出，研究AI对环境的影响具有重要意义。

Method: 通过分析数据中心的能源消耗和AI模型的运行需求，结合短期和长期的碳排放预测，评估AI对CO2排放的潜在影响。

Result: 短期内，AI的普及可能导致能源消耗和碳排放增加；但长期来看，AI的自动化和优化能力有望显著减少碳排放。

Conclusion: AI在初期可能对环境造成压力，但长期来看有望成为气候减缓和碳减排的重要工具。

Abstract: Thanks to the availability of massive amounts of data, computing resources,
and advanced algorithms, AI has entered nearly every sector. This has sparked
significant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with
the necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and
AI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy
consumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering
both near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and
beyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net
positive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,
we discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive
workflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and
consumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely
strain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and
therefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of
big data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and
complex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and
applications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more
promising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its
ability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from
energy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon
footprint. This positive impact is anticipated to outweigh the initial
emissions bump, creating value for businesses and society in areas where
traditional solutions have fallen short. In essence, AI might cause some
initial growing pains for the environment, but it has the potential to support
climate mitigation efforts.

*Nikesh Prajapati,Bimal Karki,Saroj Gopali,Akbar Siami Namin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文通过深度学习模型检测物联网恶意攻击，评估了多种模型（如GraphSAGE、BERT、TCN等）在恶意流量检测中的表现，其中BERT表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网系统流量模式具有时序性和多样性，为模型学习提供了丰富的数据，因此研究如何利用深度学习模型高效检测恶意攻击。

Method: 采用GraphSAGE、BERT、TCN、Multi-Head Attention、BI-LSTM和LSTM等模型，分析其检测能力和性能。

Result: BERT表现最优，准确率达99.94%，其他指标（如F1-score）接近99.99%；Multi-Head Attention检测能力好但耗时；GraphSAGE训练时间最短但性能较低。

Conclusion: BERT在捕获时序依赖方面表现出色，是检测物联网恶意攻击的最佳选择；其他模型各有优劣，可根据需求选择。

Abstract: This paper intends to detect IoT malicious attacks through deep learning
models and demonstrates a comprehensive evaluation of the deep learning and
graph-based models regarding malicious network traffic detection. The models
particularly are based on GraphSAGE, Bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers (BERT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as well as Multi-Head
Attention, together with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM)
Multi-Head Attention and BI-LSTM and LSTM models. The chosen models
demonstrated great performance to model temporal patterns and detect feature
significance. The observed performance are mainly due to the fact that IoT
system traffic patterns are both sequential and diverse, leaving a rich set of
temporal patterns for the models to learn. Experimental results showed that
BERT maintained the best performance. It achieved 99.94% accuracy rate
alongside high precision and recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 99.99% which
demonstrates its capabilities through temporal dependency capture. The
Multi-Head Attention offered promising results by providing good detection
capabilities with interpretable results. On the other side, the Multi-Head
Attention model required significant processing time like BI-LSTM variants. The
GraphSAGE model achieved good accuracy while requiring the shortest training
time but yielded the lowest accuracy, precision, and F1 score compared to the
other models

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在复杂任务中的普及，检测AI辅助变得重要但具有挑战性，尤其是对抽象任务数据。研究旨在探索如何通过预处理使神经网络有效分类此类数据。

Method: 构建了四种神经网络友好的图像表示方法和一种时间序列表示方法，用于编码用户探索/利用行为。测试了三种经典深度学习架构和一种并行CNN-RNN架构。

Result: 实验表明，适当的预处理和时空编码显著提升了模型在抽象任务中检测AI辅助的性能，并行CNN-RNN架构表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究证明了预处理和时空编码对检测AI辅助的重要性，为抽象任务中的AI辅助检测提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Detecting assistance from artificial intelligence is increasingly important
as they become ubiquitous across complex tasks such as text generation, medical
diagnosis, and autonomous driving. Aid detection is challenging for humans,
especially when looking at abstract task data. Artificial neural networks excel
at classification thanks to their ability to quickly learn from and process
large amounts of data -- assuming appropriate preprocessing. We posit detecting
help from AI as a classification task for such models. Much of the research in
this space examines the classification of complex but concrete data classes,
such as images. Many AI assistance detection scenarios, however, result in data
that is not machine learning-friendly. We demonstrate that common models can
effectively classify such data when it is appropriately preprocessed. To do so,
we construct four distinct neural network-friendly image formulations along
with an additional time-series formulation that explicitly encodes the
exploration/exploitation of users, which allows for generalizability to other
abstract tasks. We benchmark the quality of each image formulation across three
classical deep learning architectures, along with a parallel CNN-RNN
architecture that leverages the additional time series to maximize testing
performance, showcasing the importance of encoding temporal and spatial
quantities for detecting AI aid in abstract tasks.

TL;DR: SigmaScheduling动态调整决策点时间，提高移动健康干预的及时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定时间间隔的决策点调度对习惯性行为干预效果不佳，尤其是对作息不规律的用户。

Method: 提出SigmaScheduling方法，根据行为时间预测的不确定性动态调整决策点。

Result: 在68名参与者的试验中，SigmaScheduling在70%以上的情况下确保决策点早于刷牙行为。

Conclusion: SigmaScheduling提升了移动健康干预的精准性，尤其适用于时间敏感的习惯性行为。

Abstract: Timely decision making is critical to the effectiveness of mobile health
(mHealth) interventions. At predefined timepoints called "decision points,"
intelligent mHealth systems such as just-in-time adaptive interventions
(JITAIs) estimate an individual's biobehavioral context from sensor or survey
data and determine whether and how to intervene. For interventions targeting
habitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on
delivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur.
Current practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour)
before user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same
for all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly
for individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after
the target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective.
In this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule
decision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior
timing is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to
the predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling
schedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely
intervention. We evaluated SigmaScheduling using real-world data from 68
participants in a 10-week trial of Oralytics, a JITAI designed to improve daily
toothbrushing. SigmaScheduling increased the likelihood that decision points
preceded brushing events in at least 70% of cases, preserving opportunities to
intervene and impact behavior. Our results indicate that SigmaScheduling can
advance precision mHealth, particularly for JITAIs targeting time-sensitive,
habitual behaviors such as oral hygiene or dietary habits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在需要深度解释和领域专业知识的归纳主题分析任务中的挑战。

Method: 使用两个Reddit数据集，通过零样本、单样本和少样本提示策略，将任务建模为一系列二元分类问题。

Result: GPT-4o在少样本提示下表现最佳（准确率90.9%，F1分数0.71），高流行主题的分布与专家分类接近。

Conclusion: 少样本LLM方法可自动化主题分析，为定性研究提供可扩展的补充。

Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in inductive thematic
analysis, a task requiring deep interpretive and domain-specific expertise. We
evaluated the feasibility of using LLMs to replicate expert-driven thematic
analysis of social media data. Methods Using two temporally non-intersecting
Reddit datasets on xylazine (n=286 and n=686, for model optimization and
validation, respectively) with twelve expert-derived themes, we evaluated five
LLMs against expert coding. We modeled the task as a series of binary
classifications, rather than a single, multi-label classification, employing
zero-, single-, and few-shot prompting strategies and measuring performance via
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results On the validation set,
GPT-4o with two-shot prompting performed best (accuracy: 90.9%; F1-score:
0.71). For high-prevalence themes, model-derived thematic distributions closely
mirrored expert classifications (e.g., xylazine use: 13.6% vs. 17.8%; MOUD use:
16.5% vs. 17.8%). Conclusions Our findings suggest that few-shot LLM-based
approaches can automate thematic analyses, offering a scalable supplement for
qualitative research. Keywords: thematic analysis, large language models,
natural language processing, qualitative analysis, social media, prompt
engineering, public health

Method: AF-XRAY引入分层可视化、攻击边分类、替代解决方案叠加可视化及关键攻击集识别等方法。

Result: 工具能将模糊场景转化为明确的解决方案，揭示不同假设如何导致不同结论。

Conclusion: AF-XRAY支持目的论法律推理，帮助用户理解歧义原因并探索替代解决方案。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide formal approaches for legal reasoning,
but identifying sources of ambiguity and explaining argument acceptance remains
challenging for non-experts. We present AF-XRAY, an open-source toolkit for
exploring, analyzing, and visualizing abstract AFs in legal reasoning. AF-XRAY
introduces: (i) layered visualizations based on game-theoretic argument length
revealing well-founded derivation structures; (ii) classification of attack
edges by semantic roles (primary, secondary, blunders); (iii) overlay
visualizations of alternative 2-valued solutions on ambiguous 3-valued grounded
semantics; and (iv) identification of critical attack sets whose suspension
resolves undecided arguments. Through systematic generation of critical attack
sets, AF-XRAY transforms ambiguous scenarios into grounded solutions, enabling
users to pinpoint specific causes of ambiguity and explore alternative
resolutions. We use real-world legal cases (e.g., Wild Animals as modeled by
Bench-Capon) to show that our tool supports teleological legal reasoning by
revealing how different assumptions lead to different justified conclusions.

expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized
annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale
research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for
automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer
explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects,
and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular
architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while
the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy
of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting
adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training.
Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive
annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on
three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic
diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction
quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on
expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from
specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable
research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the
effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的多代理系统（MAS）在慢性多病患者治疗推荐中的可行性和价值，模拟多学科团队（MDT）决策，结果显示单代理系统表现与MDT相当，但建议仍存在不完整和不必要的药物问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性多病患者的治疗推荐存在治疗冲突风险，现有决策支持系统扩展性有限，研究旨在探索LLM-MAS模拟MDT决策的潜力。

Method: 设计单代理和MAS框架，模拟MDT决策过程，通过LLM代理讨论解决医疗冲突，并在多病治疗任务中评估性能。

Result: 单代理GP表现与MDT相当，部分模型建议虽正确但存在不完整和不必要的药物问题。

Conclusion: LLM-MAS在多病治疗推荐中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以减少不完整和不必要的药物建议。

Abstract: Therapy recommendation for chronic patients with multimorbidity is
challenging due to risks of treatment conflicts. Existing decision support
systems face scalability limitations. Inspired by the way in which general
practitioners (GP) manage multimorbidity patients, occasionally convening
multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration, this study investigated the
feasibility and value of using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent
system (MAS) for safer therapy recommendations. We designed a single agent and
a MAS framework simulating MDT decision-making by enabling discussion among LLM
agents to resolve medical conflicts. The systems were evaluated on therapy
planning tasks for multimorbidity patients using benchmark cases. We compared
MAS performance with single-agent approaches and real-world benchmarks. An
important contribution of our study is the definition of evaluation metrics
that go beyond the technical precision and recall and allow the inspection of
clinical goals met and medication burden of the proposed advices to a gold
standard benchmark. Our results show that with current LLMs, a single agent GP
performs as well as MDTs. The best-scoring models provide correct
recommendations that address all clinical goals, yet the advices are
incomplete. Some models also present unnecessary medications, resulting in
unnecessary conflicts between medication and conditions or drug-drug
interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质语言模型在功能优化和设计中有优势，但可能生成有害序列，带来生物安全和伦理挑战。

Method: 结合蛋白质安全知识图谱，采用图剪枝策略和强化学习，优化序列生成。

Result: KPO显著降低有害序列生成概率，同时保持高功能性。

Conclusion: KPO为生物技术中生成模型的应用提供了安全保证。

Abstract: Protein language models have emerged as powerful tools for sequence
generation, offering substantial advantages in functional optimization and
denovo design. However, these models also present significant risks of
generating harmful protein sequences, such as those that enhance viral
transmissibility or evade immune responses. These concerns underscore critical
biosafety and ethical challenges. To address these issues, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Preference Optimization (KPO) framework that integrates prior
knowledge via a Protein Safety Knowledge Graph. This framework utilizes an
efficient graph pruning strategy to identify preferred sequences and employs
reinforcement learning to minimize the risk of generating harmful proteins.
Experimental results demonstrate that KPO effectively reduces the likelihood of
producing hazardous sequences while maintaining high functionality, offering a
robust safety assurance framework for applying generative models in
biotechnology.

Result: 模型预测鸟类分布的准确率达85%。

Conclusion: 提供了一种可扩展且可靠的方法，用于理解鸟类迁徙和栖息地变化。

Abstract: Due to climate-induced changes, many habitats are experiencing range shifts
away from their traditional geographic locations (Piguet, 2011). We propose a
solution to accurately model whether bird species are present in a specific
habitat through the combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
(O'Shea, 2015) and tabular data. Our approach makes use of satellite imagery
and environmental features (e.g., temperature, precipitation, elevation) to
predict bird presence across various climates. The CNN model captures spatial
characteristics of landscapes such as forestation, water bodies, and
urbanization, whereas the tabular method uses ecological and geographic data.
Both systems predict the distribution of birds with an average accuracy of 85%,
offering a scalable but reliable method to understand bird migration.

Result: 在四个真实世界任务中验证了ExRec的有效性，展示了其对新问题的鲁棒性和可解释的学习轨迹。

Conclusion: ExRec展示了知识追踪引导的强化学习在教育个性化中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce ExRec, a general framework for personalized exercise
recommendation with semantically-grounded knowledge tracing. Our method builds
on the observation that existing exercise recommendation approaches simulate
student performance via knowledge tracing (KT) but they often overlook two key
aspects: (a) the semantic content of questions and (b) the sequential,
structured progression of student learning. To address this, our ExRec presents
an end-to-end pipeline, from annotating the KCs of questions and learning their
semantic representations to training KT models and optimizing several
reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Moreover, we improve standard
Q-learning-based continuous RL methods via a tailored model-based value
estimation (MVE) approach that directly leverages the components of KT model in
estimating cumulative knowledge improvement. We validate the effectiveness of
our ExRec using various RL methods across four real-world tasks with different
educational goals in online math learning. We further show that ExRec
generalizes robustly to new, unseen questions and that it produces
interpretable student learning trajectories. Together, our findings highlight
the promise of KT-guided RL for effective personalization in education.

Motivation: 传统手工规则方法在复杂战场环境中脆弱，而现有强化学习方法缺乏可解释性，主要关注动作而非战略决策。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型进行场景理解和轻量级大语言模型进行战略推理，实现感知与决策的统一。

Result: 仿真实验显示，该方法相比基线模型胜率超过80%。

Conclusion: 该方法具有强适应性和可解释性，模拟了人类指挥官的认知过程。

Abstract: In multiple unmanned ground vehicle confrontations, autonomously evolving
multi-agent tactical decisions from situational awareness remain a significant
challenge. Traditional handcraft rule-based methods become vulnerable in the
complicated and transient battlefield environment, and current reinforcement
learning methods mainly focus on action manipulation instead of strategic
decisions due to lack of interpretability. Here, we propose a vision-language
model-based commander to address the issue of intelligent
perception-to-decision reasoning in autonomous confrontations. Our method
integrates a vision language model for scene understanding and a lightweight
large language model for strategic reasoning, achieving unified perception and
decision within a shared semantic space, with strong adaptability and
interpretability. Unlike rule-based search and reinforcement learning methods,
the combination of the two modules establishes a full-chain process, reflecting
the cognitive process of human commanders. Simulation and ablation experiments
validate that the proposed approach achieves a win rate of over 80% compared
with baseline models.

Result: 实验表明F2STrans显著提升性能，Qwen-1.5B甚至优于Qwen-32B和GPT-4。

Conclusion: F2STrans为代码翻译任务提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in code
translation tasks. However, ensuring both the correctness and readability of
translated code remains a challenge, limiting their effective adoption in
real-world software development. In this work, we propose F2STrans, a
function-to-style guiding paradigm designed to progressively improve the
performance of LLMs in code translation. Our approach comprises two key stages:
(1) Functional learning, which optimizes translation correctness using
high-quality source-target code pairs mined from online programming platforms,
and (2) Style learning, which improves translation readability by incorporating
both positive and negative style examples. Additionally, we introduce a novel
code translation benchmark that includes up-to-date source code, extensive test
cases, and manually annotated ground-truth translations, enabling comprehensive
functional and stylistic evaluations. Experiments on both our new benchmark and
existing datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves code
translation performance. Notably, our approach enables Qwen-1.5B to outperform
prompt-enhanced Qwen-32B and GPT-4 on average across 20 diverse code
translation scenarios.

Motivation: 解决实物资产与区块链系统之间的桥梁问题，同时满足严格的合规性、流动性和风险管理要求。

Method: 采用多个协作AI代理（合规、令牌发行、做市和风险控制）和一个协调核心，结合链上智能合约和链下AI决策。

Result: 原型实现按需令牌发行时间低于1.2秒，做市代理在波动条件下保持0.5%以下的点差，系统在故障注入测试中表现出韧性。

Conclusion: AI代理驱动的去中心化交易所能够满足严格的性能和安全性要求，并为传统非流动性资产的民主化访问提供了可能。

Abstract: Decentralized trading of real-world alternative assets (e.g., gold) requires
bridging physical asset custody with blockchain systems while meeting strict
requirements for compliance, liquidity, and risk management. We present
GoldMine OS, a research oriented architecture that employs multiple specialized
AI agents to automate and secure the tokenization and exchange of physical gold
into a blockchain based stablecoin ("OZ"). Our approach combines on chain smart
contracts for critical risk controls with off chain AI agents for decision
making, blending the transparency and reliability of blockchains with the
flexibility of AI driven automation. We describe four cooperative agents
(Compliance, Token Issuance, Market Making, and Risk Control) and a
coordinating core, and evaluate the system through simulation and a controlled
pilot deployment. In experiments the prototype delivers on demand token
issuance in under 1.2 s, more than 100 times faster than manual workflows. The
Market Making agent maintains tight liquidity with spreads often below 0.5
percent even under volatile conditions. Fault injection tests show resilience:
an oracle price spoofing attack is detected and mitigated within 10 s, and a
simulated vault mis reporting halts issuance immediately with minimal user
impact. The architecture scales to 5000 transactions per second with 10000
concurrent users in benchmarks. These results indicate that an AI agent based
decentralized exchange for alternative assets can satisfy rigorous performance
and safety requirements. We discuss broader implications for democratizing
access to traditionally illiquid assets and explain how our governance model --
multi signature agent updates and on chain community voting on risk parameters
-- provides ongoing transparency, adaptability, and formal assurance of system
integrity.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI focuses on integrating learning and reasoning, in

existence of an alphabet soup of neurosymbolic AI systems, the field is lacking
a generally accepted formal definition of what neurosymbolic models and
inference really are. We introduce a formal definition for neurosymbolic AI
that makes abstraction of its key ingredients. More specifically, we define
neurosymbolic inference as the computation of an integral over a product of a
logical and a belief function. We show that our neurosymbolic AI definition
makes abstraction of key representative neurosymbolic AI systems.

Result: 通过BDD模型和简化规则，实现了高效协作自动推理。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了自主系统在复杂环境中的可信决策能力。

Abstract: Autonomous systems are becoming an integral part of many application domains,
like in the mobility sector. However, ensuring their safe and correct behaviour
in dynamic and complex environments remains a significant challenge, where
systems should autonomously make decisions e.g., about manoeuvring. We propose
in this paper a general collaborative approach for increasing the level of
trustworthiness in the environment of operation and improve reliability and
good decision making in autonomous system. In the presence of conflicting
information, aggregation becomes a major issue for trustworthy decision making
based on collaborative data sharing. Unlike classical approaches in the
literature that rely on consensus or majority as aggregation rule, we exploit
the fact that autonomous systems have different quality attributes like
perception quality. We use this criteria to determine which autonomous systems
are trustworthy and borrow concepts from social epistemology to define
aggregation and propagation rules, used for automated decision making. We use
Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) as formal models for beliefs aggregation and
propagation, and formulate reduction rules to reduce the size of the BDDs and
allow efficient computation structures for collaborative automated reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种使用答案集编程（ASP）精确计算组合电路最大延迟的方法，以替代传统的静态时序分析，从而提高处理器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的静态时序分析虽然能在多项式时间内计算出最大延迟的上界，但可能导致处理器性能未达最优。

Method: 将问题建模为答案集编程（ASP），并提出非平凡的编码方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，ASP能有效解决硬件设计中的复杂问题。

Conclusion: ASP是一种可行的解决方案，可用于精确计算组合电路的最大延迟。

Abstract: In the design of integrated circuits, one critical metric is the maximum
delay introduced by combinational modules within the circuit. This delay is
crucial because it represents the time required to perform a computation: in an
Arithmetic-Logic Unit it represents the maximum time taken by the circuit to
perform an arithmetic operation. When such a circuit is part of a larger,
synchronous system, like a CPU, the maximum delay directly impacts the maximum
clock frequency of the entire system. Typically, hardware designers use Static
Timing Analysis to compute an upper bound of the maximum delay because it can
be determined in polynomial time. However, relying on this upper bound can lead
to suboptimal processor speeds, thereby missing performance opportunities. In
this work, we tackle the challenging task of computing the actual maximum
delay, rather than an approximate value. Since the problem is computationally
hard, we model it in Answer Set Programming (ASP), a logic language featuring
extremely efficient solvers. We propose non-trivial encodings of the problem
into ASP. Experimental results show that ASP is a viable solution to address
complex problems in hardware design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱推理方法因分数过平滑问题导致正确与错误答案区分度降低，影响推理效果。

Method: 提出 DuetGraph，采用双路径（全局注意力与局部消息传递）分离处理信息，并引入粗到细优化策略，将实体分为高低分数子集以减少候选空间。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现 SOTA 性能，推理质量提升 8.7%，训练效率加速 1.8 倍。

Conclusion: DuetGraph 通过双路径融合和粗到细优化有效解决过平滑问题，显著提升知识图谱推理性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for enabling knowledge reasoning across
various domains. Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and
local information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods
often suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between
correct and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address
this, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with
dual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by
segregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message
passing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,
preventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.
In addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which
partitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the
candidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which
alleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments
on various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a
1.8$\times$ acceleration in training efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed within agentic
systems-collections of interacting, LLM-powered agents that execute complex,
adaptive workflows using memory, tools, and dynamic planning. While enabling
powerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of
uncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and
fluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations
practices fall short in addressing these challenges.
  This paper introduces AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing,
analyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We
identify distinct needs across four key roles-developers, testers, site
reliability engineers (SREs), and business users-each of whom engages with the
system at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation
Pipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric
collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations,
and runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of
automation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems-not
by eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and
effective operation.

Conclusion: Opus框架显著提高了工作流生成质量，尤其在混合意图场景下表现优异。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Prompt Intention Framework, designed to
improve complex Workflow Generation with instruction-tuned Large Language
Models (LLMs). We propose an intermediate Intention Capture layer between user
queries and Workflow Generation, implementing the Opus Workflow Intention
Framework, which consists of extracting Workflow Signals from user queries,
interpreting them into structured Workflow Intention objects, and generating
Workflows based on these Intentions. Our results show that this layer enables
LLMs to produce logical and meaningful outputs that scale reliably as query
complexity increases. On a synthetic benchmark of 1,000 multi-intent
query-Workflow(s) pairs, applying the Opus Prompt Intention Framework to
Workflow Generation yields consistent improvements in semantic Workflow
similarity metrics. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Prompt Intention
Framework by applying the concepts of Workflow Signal and Workflow Intention to
LLM-driven Workflow Generation. We present a reproducible, customizable
LLM-based Intention Capture system to extract Workflow Signals and Workflow
Intentions from user queries. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the
proposed system significantly improves Workflow Generation quality compared to
direct generation from user queries, particularly in cases of Mixed Intention
Elicitation.

Result: 在模拟个性化推荐系统和多层感知器的合成EW-QBAFs上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: G-RAEs和迭代算法能有效解决EW-QBAFs的可争议性问题。

Abstract: Contestable AI requires that AI-driven decisions align with human
preferences. While various forms of argumentation have been shown to support
contestability, Edge-Weighted Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks
(EW-QBAFs) have received little attention. In this work, we show how EW-QBAFs
can be deployed for this purpose. Specifically, we introduce the contestability
problem for EW-QBAFs, which asks how to modify edge weights (e.g., preferences)
to achieve a desired strength for a specific argument of interest (i.e., a
topic argument). To address this problem, we propose gradient-based relation
attribution explanations (G-RAEs), which quantify the sensitivity of the topic
argument's strength to changes in individual edge weights, thus providing
interpretable guidance for weight adjustments towards contestability. Building
on G-RAEs, we develop an iterative algorithm that progressively adjusts the
edge weights to attain the desired strength. We evaluate our approach
experimentally on synthetic EW-QBAFs that simulate the structural
characteristics of personalised recommender systems and multi-layer
perceptrons, and demonstrate that it can solve the problem effectively.

Conclusion: CogDDN通过模拟人类认知机制，显著提升了机器人在未知环境中的导航能力，为需求导航提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly required to navigate and interact within
unknown and unstructured environments to meet human demands. Demand-driven
navigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on
implicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However,
traditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model
training and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in
unseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that
emulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and
slow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to
fulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by
semantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions.
Furthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising
a Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that
analyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously
improves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the
decision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor
simulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view
camera-only methods by 15%, demonstrating significant improvements in
navigation accuracy and adaptability. The project page is available at

decisions that demand both domain expertise and rapid and continuous
replanning. While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics
plans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume
an idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for
uncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle
uncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to
entry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they
remain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety
and cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility
of natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation.
It converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies
its own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive
clarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A
lightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples,
surpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency
by nearly 50%. These preliminary results highlight a practical path toward
certifiable, real-time, and user-aligned decision-making for complex logistics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合代码文本建模与结构化建模优势的新方法，以弥补现有LLMs在代码分析和生成能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的代码LLMs在分析代码的结构化属性（如控制流和数据流）方面能力有限，而结构化建模方法又缺乏生成能力和规模。

Method: 结合代码文本建模与结构化建模的方法。

Result: 未明确提及具体实验结果。

Conclusion: 新方法旨在弥补现有LLMs的不足，结合两者的优势。

Abstract: Code LLMs have become extremely popular recently for modeling source code
across a variety of tasks, such as generation, translation, and summarization.
However, transformer-based models are limited in their capabilities to reason
through structured, analytical properties of code, such as control and data
flow. Previous work has explored the modeling of these properties with
structured data and graph neural networks. However, these approaches lack the
generative capabilities and scale of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach to combine the strengths of modeling both code as text and more
structured forms.

Abstract: AI systems that "think" in human language offer a unique opportunity for AI

imperfect and allows some misbehavior to go unnoticed. Nevertheless, it shows
promise and we recommend further research into CoT monitorability and
investment in CoT monitoring alongside existing safety methods. Because CoT
monitorability may be fragile, we recommend that frontier model developers
consider the impact of development decisions on CoT monitorability.

Conclusion: PAiR通过将基于视角的身份模型嵌入沉浸式系统，为人机交互开辟了新方向。

Abstract: AI-enhanced Extended Reality (XR) aims to deliver adaptive, immersive

learned from multimodal digital footprints that capture users' cognitive and
experiential evolution. PAiR employs these models in a closed-loop system
linking dynamic user states with immersive environments. We present PAiR's
architecture, detailing its modules and system flow, and demonstrate its
utility through two proof-of-concept scenarios implemented in the Unity-based

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习的三个核心假设（代理定义、学习目标和奖励假设范围）需要重新评估，以推动理论和应用的发展。

Method: 借鉴开放进化理论，重新审视这三个假设，并结合进化动力学和生命起源理论进行分析。

Result: 进化理论可以丰富强化学习的视角，但代理问题需要结合生命起源理论来解决。

Conclusion: 进化理论为强化学习提供了新的视角，但代理问题需进一步整合生命起源理论以完善理解。

Abstract: Three core tenets of reinforcement learning (RL)--concerning the definition
of agency, the objective of learning, and the scope of the reward
hypothesis--have been highlighted as key targets for conceptual revision, with
major implications for theory and application. We propose a framework, inspired
by open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three "dogmas." We
revisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To
make our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first
establish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains
over an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational
processes. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary
insights to enrich the "adaptation-rather-than-search" view of learning. We
then address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,
using analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.
multi-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration
in RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence
of a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the
evolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it
gestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from
origins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication
offer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained
reinforcement learning in biological systems.

Conclusion: IFScale揭示了高密度指令下的性能瓶颈，为实际应用中的提示设计提供参考，并开源了基准和结果。

Abstract: Production-grade LLM systems require robust adherence to dozens or even
hundreds of instructions simultaneously. However, the instruction-following
capabilities of LLMs at high instruction densities have not yet been
characterized, as existing benchmarks only evaluate models on tasks with a
single or few instructions. We introduce IFScale, a simple benchmark of 500
keyword-inclusion instructions for a business report writing task to measure
how instruction-following performance degrades as instruction density
increases. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models across seven major providers
and find that even the best frontier models only achieve 68% accuracy at the
max density of 500 instructions. Our analysis reveals model size and reasoning
capability to correlate with 3 distinct performance degradation patterns, bias
towards earlier instructions, and distinct categories of instruction-following
errors. Our insights can help inform design of instruction-dense prompts in
real-world applications and highlight important performance-latency tradeoffs.
We open-source the benchmark and all results for further analysis at

TL;DR: CWNet利用小波变换和因果推理改进低光图像增强，通过全局度量学习和局部语义损失保持因果一致性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低光图像增强方法忽视实例级语义信息和特征特性，CWNet旨在通过因果推理和小波变换解决这一问题。

Method: 结合因果推理（全局度量学习和局部CLIP语义损失）与小波变换网络，优化频率信息恢复。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: CWNet通过因果推理和小波变换有效提升低光图像增强性能，代码开源。

Abstract: Traditional Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods primarily focus on
uniform brightness adjustment, often neglecting instance-level semantic
information and the inherent characteristics of different features. To address
these limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel
architecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning.
Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the
concept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective
to reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a
global perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal
embeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal
confounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the
local level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely
maintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present
a wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the
recovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the
specific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across
multiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.

Motivation: 解决新细胞系在扰动筛选中因形态和生物异质性带来的挑战。

Result: 在RxRx数据库上验证，通过少量样本微调显著提升了对新细胞系的显微镜图像分析能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在表型药物发现中具有实际应用价值，能有效处理新细胞系的异质性。

Abstract: High-throughput screening techniques, such as microscopy imaging of cellular
responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, play a crucial role in drug
discovery and biomedical research. However, robust perturbation screening for
\textit{de novo} cell lines remains challenging due to the significant
morphological and biological heterogeneity across cell lines. To address this,
we propose a novel framework that integrates external biological knowledge into
existing pretraining strategies to enhance microscopy image profiling models.
Our approach explicitly disentangles perturbation-specific and cell
line-specific representations using external biological information.
Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph leveraging protein interaction
data from STRING and Hetionet databases to guide models toward
perturbation-specific features during pretraining. Additionally, we incorporate
transcriptomic features from single-cell foundation models to capture cell
line-specific representations. By learning these disentangled features, our
method improves the generalization of imaging models to \textit{de novo} cell
lines. We evaluate our framework on the RxRx database through one-shot
fine-tuning on an RxRx1 cell line and few-shot fine-tuning on cell lines from
the RxRx19a dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances
microscopy image profiling for \textit{de novo} cell lines, highlighting its
effectiveness in real-world phenotype-based drug discovery applications.

TL;DR: 该研究审计了两个先进的面部表情识别（FER）数据集，发现其中许多图像是摆拍而非自然表情，且FER模型对非白人或深肤色人群存在偏见，倾向于将其微笑误判为负面情绪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FER算法在检测自然表情时性能下降，且对不同种族和肤色的人群表现不佳，这些问题与数据集收集方式有关。

Method: 从两个数据集中随机抽样，区分自然与摆拍图像，并测试三个模型对不同肤色人群的表情预测准确性。

Result: 发现数据集中存在大量摆拍图像，且模型对非白人或深肤色人群的负面情绪预测存在偏见。

Conclusion: 数据集的质量和模型的偏见可能在实际应用中导致性能不准确和潜在危害。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) algorithms classify facial expressions
into emotions such as happy, sad, or angry. An evaluative challenge facing FER
algorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions
compared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER
algorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and
skin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices
employed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two
state-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and
examine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a
methodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a
significant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to
consist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between
spontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these
datasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be
deployed in in-the-wild applications. We also observe the skin color of
individuals in the samples, and test three models trained on each of the
datasets to predict facial expressions of people from various races and skin
tones. We find that the FER models audited were more likely to predict people
labeled as not white or determined to have dark skin as showing a negative
emotion such as anger or sadness even when they were smiling. This bias makes
such models prone to perpetuate harm in real life applications.

Motivation: 传统方法需要为兴趣点分配描述符并进行匹配，计算和存储成本高。

Method: 在检测过程中直接关联兴趣点，避免描述符的计算、存储和匹配。

Result: 匹配精度略低，但内存使用大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该方法在内存效率上有显著优势，适用于对内存敏感的定位系统。

Abstract: The extraction and matching of interest points are fundamental to many
geometric computer vision tasks. Traditionally, matching is performed by
assigning descriptors to interest points and identifying correspondences based
on descriptor similarity. This work introduces a technique where interest
points are inherently associated during detection, eliminating the need for
computing, storing, transmitting, or matching descriptors. Although the
matching accuracy is marginally lower than that of conventional approaches, our
method completely eliminates the need for descriptors, leading to a drastic
reduction in memory usage for localization systems. We assess its effectiveness
by comparing it against both classical handcrafted methods and modern learned
approaches.

Conclusion: 该数据集和模型为航天器实时图像分割提供了有效基准，支持自主检测系统的开发。

Abstract: Spacecraft deployed in outer space are routinely subjected to various forms
of damage due to exposure to hazardous environments. In addition, there are
significant risks to the subsequent process of in-space repairs through human
extravehicular activity or robotic manipulation, incurring substantial
operational costs. Recent developments in image segmentation could enable the
development of reliable and cost-effective autonomous inspection systems. While
these models often require large amounts of training data to achieve
satisfactory results, publicly available annotated spacecraft segmentation data
are very scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of nearly 64k annotated
spacecraft images that was created using real spacecraft models, superimposed
on a mixture of real and synthetic backgrounds generated using NASA's TTALOS
pipeline. To mimic camera distortions and noise in real-world image
acquisition, we also added different types of noise and distortion to the
images. Finally, we finetuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 segmentation models to
generate performance benchmarks for the dataset under well-defined hardware and
inference time constraints to mimic real-world image segmentation challenges
for real-time onboard applications in space on NASA's inspector spacecraft. The
resulting models, when tested under these constraints, achieved a Dice score of
0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and an inference time of about 0.5 second.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有嵌套Transformer模型对所有输入分配相同计算资源导致的效率低下问题。

Method: 采用渐进式思考阶段和Token Recycling机制，动态激活注意力头并基于前一阶段嵌入优化推理。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，相同吞吐量下精度提升2.0 p.p.，相同计算量下提升2.9 p.p.。

Conclusion: ThinkingViT通过动态计算分配显著提升效率，同时可作为插件升级现有ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformers deliver state-of-the-art performance, yet their fixed
computational budget prevents scalable deployment across heterogeneous
hardware. Recent nested Transformer architectures mitigate this by embedding
nested subnetworks within a single model to enable scalable inference. However,
these models allocate the same amount of compute to all inputs, regardless of
their complexity, which leads to inefficiencies. To address this, we introduce
ThinkingViT, a nested ViT architecture that employs progressive thinking stages
to dynamically adjust inference computation based on input difficulty.
ThinkingViT initiates inference by activating a small subset of the most
important attention heads and terminates early if predictions reach sufficient
certainty. Otherwise, it activates additional attention heads and re-evaluates
the input. At the core of ThinkingViT is our Token Recycling mechanism, which
conditions each subsequent inference stage on the embeddings from the previous
stage, enabling progressive improvement. Due to its backbone-preserving design,
ThinkingViT also serves as a plugin upgrade for vanilla ViT. Experiments show
that ThinkingViT surpasses nested baselines by up to 2.0 percentage points
(p.p.) in accuracy at the same throughput and by up to 2.9 p.p. at equal GMACs
on ImageNet-1K. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的自主目标检测框架（LAOD），实现无需标签的零样本检测，通过动态生成场景特定对象名称并评估其定位和命名性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测依赖固定类别集，灵活性不足；现有开放世界和开放词汇检测方法存在语义标签缺失或依赖用户提示的问题。

Method: 利用LLM生成场景特定对象名称，结合开放词汇检测器进行定位，引入CAAP和SNAP指标分别评估定位和命名。

Result: 在LVIS、COCO和COCO-OOD数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了检测和命名新对象的强大性能。

Conclusion: LAOD框架提升了开放世界理解的自主性和适应性。

Abstract: Object detection traditionally relies on fixed category sets, requiring
costly re-training to handle novel objects. While Open-World and
Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OWOD and OVOD) improve flexibility, OWOD
lacks semantic labels for unknowns, and OVOD depends on user prompts, limiting
autonomy. We propose an LLM-guided agentic object detection (LAOD) framework
that enables fully label-free, zero-shot detection by prompting a Large
Language Model (LLM) to generate scene-specific object names. These are passed
to an open-vocabulary detector for localization, allowing the system to adapt
its goals dynamically. We introduce two new metrics, Class-Agnostic Average
Precision (CAAP) and Semantic Naming Average Precision (SNAP), to separately
evaluate localization and naming. Experiments on LVIS, COCO, and COCO-OOD
validate our approach, showing strong performance in detecting and naming novel
objects. Our method offers enhanced autonomy and adaptability for open-world
understanding.

Motivation: 解释卷积神经网络（CNN）的决策过程在高风险领域至关重要，但现有方法如Grad-CAM可能掩盖重要语义或放大噪声。

Method: 提出Winsor-CAM，通过Winsorization技术衰减异常值，并允许用户通过阈值调整语义层次。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上，Winsor-CAM生成的显著性图更易解释，且在定位指标上优于Grad-CAM。

Conclusion: Winsor-CAM通过多层解释和用户控制，推动了可信AI的发展。

Abstract: Interpreting the decision-making process of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) is critical for deploying models in high-stakes domains.
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a widely used method
for visual explanations, yet it typically focuses on the final convolutional
layer or na\"ively averages across layers, strategies that can obscure
important semantic cues or amplify irrelevant noise. We propose Winsor-CAM, a
novel, human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that generates robust and coherent
saliency maps by aggregating information across all convolutional layers. To
mitigate the influence of noisy or extreme attribution values, Winsor-CAM
applies Winsorization, a percentile-based outlier attenuation technique. A
user-controllable threshold allows for semantic-level tuning, enabling flexible
exploration of model behavior across representational hierarchies. Evaluations
on standard architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, InceptionV3) using the
PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that Winsor-CAM produces more interpretable
heatmaps and achieves superior performance in localization metrics, including
intersection-over-union and center-of-mass alignment, when compared to Grad-CAM
and uniform layer-averaging baselines. Winsor-CAM advances the goal of
trustworthy AI by offering interpretable, multi-layer insights with
human-in-the-loop control.

Abstract: Large pre-trained transformers have revolutionized artificial intelligence
across various domains, and fine-tuning remains the dominant approach for
adapting these models to downstream tasks due to the cost of training from
scratch. However, in existing fine-tuning methods, the updated representations
are formed as a dense combination of modified parameters, making it challenging
to interpret their contributions and understand how the model adapts to new
tasks. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning framework inspired by sparse
coding, where fine-tuned features are represented as a sparse combination of
basic elements, i.e., feature dictionary atoms. The feature dictionary atoms
function as fundamental building blocks of the representation, and tuning atoms
allows for seamless adaptation to downstream tasks. Sparse coefficients then
serve as indicators of atom importance, identifying the contribution of each
atom to the updated representation. Leveraging the atom selection capability of
sparse coefficients, we first demonstrate that our method enhances image
editing performance by improving text alignment through the removal of
unimportant feature dictionary atoms. Additionally, we validate the
effectiveness of our approach in the text-to-image concept customization task,
where our method efficiently constructs the target concept using a sparse
combination of feature dictionary atoms, outperforming various baseline
fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Smoke is the first visible indicator of a wildfire.With the advancement of
deep learning, image-based smoke detection has become a crucial method for
detecting and preventing forest fires. However, the scarcity of smoke image
data from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the
detection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising
solution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting
models exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,
particularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and
background contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive
framework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the
pre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks
and image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and
masked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided
by mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the
mask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated
effects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask
edges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for
subsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a
multimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and
reasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic
dataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and
diverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection
models. Code is available at https://github.com/wghr123/MFGDiffusion.

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a
crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of
mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient
framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier
removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly
available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.
Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted
their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the
robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation
and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors
and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a
fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for
real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern
augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance,
achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5
of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods,
our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited
for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study
underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when

Motivation: 准确追踪管状树结构（如血管和气道）在医学图像中至关重要，但现有模型存在重复分支和提前终止的问题。

Method: 提出Trexplorer Super，通过新方法改进性能，并开发了三个难度递增的中心线数据集（一个合成，两个真实）用于评估。

Result: Trexplorer Super在所有数据集上优于现有SOTA模型，且合成数据表现不一定适用于真实数据。

Conclusion: Trexplorer Super显著提升了中心线追踪性能，同时公开了代码和数据集以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Tubular tree structures, such as blood vessels and airways, are essential in
human anatomy and accurately tracking them while preserving their topology is
crucial for various downstream tasks. Trexplorer is a recurrent model designed
for centerline tracking in 3D medical images but it struggles with predicting
duplicate branches and terminating tracking prematurely. To address these
issues, we present Trexplorer Super, an enhanced version that notably improves
performance through novel advancements. However, evaluating centerline tracking
models is challenging due to the lack of public datasets. To enable thorough
evaluation, we develop three centerline datasets, one synthetic and two real,
each with increasing difficulty. Using these datasets, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and compare
them with our approach. Trexplorer Super outperforms previous SOTA models on
every dataset. Our results also highlight that strong performance on synthetic
data does not necessarily translate to real datasets. The code and datasets are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI天气预报模型多基于Transformer架构，计算复杂度高且资源需求大，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用现代化的CNN架构，结合尺度不变设计和InceptionNeXt模块，针对地球系统数据优化。

Result: KAI-a在中等范围天气预报中表现优异，且训练仅需12小时，参数规模为700万。

Conclusion: KAI-a为高效天气预报提供了可行方案，尤其在极端事件预测中表现出色。

Abstract: Recently, AI-based weather forecast models have achieved impressive advances.
These models have reached accuracy levels comparable to traditional NWP
systems, marking a significant milestone in data-driven weather prediction.
However, they mostly leverage Transformer-based architectures, which often
leads to high training complexity and resource demands due to the massive
parameter sizes. In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for
global weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while
significantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic
modernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across
multiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a
scale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a
geophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data.
Trained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model
contains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on
a single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the
performance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting,
while offering a significantly lightweight design. Furthermore, case studies on
the 2018 European heatwave and the East Asian summer monsoon demonstrate
KAI-a's robust skill in capturing extreme events, reinforcing its practical
utility.

Motivation: 解决EEG情感识别中时间尺度依赖标签不一致（TsDLI）的问题，提升模型的泛化能力和可解释性。

Method: 提出Local Variation Loss (LVL)和Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL)两种正则化策略，结合数学原理和图论框架。

Result: 在DREAMER和DEAP数据集上，LVL和LGCL表现优于现有方法，LVL在所有基准测试中排名第一。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在标签不一致情况下平衡了可解释性和预测能力，LVL表现最佳。

Abstract: In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent
Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based
human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization
and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local
Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods
incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of
bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic
framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new
evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local
predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our
approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion
datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including
LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct
metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency.
Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled
trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label
inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all
benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second,
highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.

Method: 使用教师模型定位全景图像，学生模型通过视场掩码处理有限视场图像，并通过对齐预测提升特征学习。

Result: 实验表明，GeoDistill显著提升了定位性能，并减少了不确定性。

Conclusion: GeoDistill为跨视角定位提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view localization, the task of estimating a camera's
3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose by aligning ground-level images with
satellite images, is crucial for large-scale outdoor applications like
autonomous navigation and augmented reality. Existing methods often rely on
fully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.
In this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self
distillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View
(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view
localization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,
while the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart
created by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those
of the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores
textureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions
and reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas
or limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly
improves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we
introduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative
orientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill
provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view
localization challenges. Code and model can be found at

Motivation: 语义变化检测（SCD）需要同时优化多个任务，容易因任务间冲突导致负迁移，因此需要一种方法来缓解这种冲突并提升多任务学习能力。

Method: 提出GAPL-SCD框架，结合语义分割和变化检测的主任务与图聚合原型学习的辅助任务，采用自适应权重分配和梯度旋转方法优化任务间冲突。

Conclusion: GAPL-SCD通过多任务联合优化和图聚合原型学习，有效解决了语义变化检测中的任务冲突问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the binary change detection task to
provide not only the change locations but also the detailed "from-to"
categories in multi-temporal remote sensing data. Such detailed semantic
insights into changes offer considerable advantages for a wide array of
applications. However, since SCD involves the simultaneous optimization of
multiple tasks, the model is prone to negative transfer due to task-specific
learning difficulties and conflicting gradient flows. To address this issue, we
propose Graph Aggregation Prototype Learning for Semantic Change Detection in
remote sensing(GAPL-SCD). In this framework, a multi-task joint optimization
method is designed to optimize the primary task of semantic segmentation and
change detection, along with the auxiliary task of graph aggregation prototype
learning. Adaptive weight allocation and gradient rotation methods are used to
alleviate the conflict between training tasks and improve multi-task learning
capabilities. Specifically, the graph aggregation prototype learning module
constructs an interaction graph using high-level features. Prototypes serve as
class proxies, enabling category-level domain alignment across time points and
reducing interference from irrelevant changes. Additionally, the proposed
self-query multi-level feature interaction and bi-temporal feature fusion
modules further enhance multi-scale feature representation, improving
performance in complex scenes. Experimental results on the SECOND and
Landsat-SCD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with significant improvements in accuracy and robustness for SCD
task.

Abstract: The latest developments in Face Restoration have yielded significant
advancements in visual quality through the utilization of diverse diffusion
priors. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of face identity introduced by
identity-obscure inputs and stochastic generative processes remains unresolved.
To address this challenge, we present Robust ID-Specific Face Restoration
(RIDFR), a novel ID-specific face restoration framework based on diffusion
models. Specifically, RIDFR leverages a pre-trained diffusion model in
conjunction with two parallel conditioning modules. The Content Injection
Module inputs the severely degraded image, while the Identity Injection Module
integrates the specific identity from a given image. Subsequently, RIDFR
incorporates Alignment Learning, which aligns the restoration results from
multiple references with the same identity in order to suppress the
interference of ID-irrelevant face semantics (e.g. pose, expression, make-up,
hair style). Experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, reconstructing high-quality ID-specific results with
high identity fidelity and demonstrating strong robustness.

Abstract: Sports action classification representing complex body postures and

Some works have contributed to automated sports action recognition using
machine learning techniques over the past decades. However, sufficient image
datasets representing women sports actions with enough intra- and inter-class
variations are not available to the researchers. To overcome this limitation,
this work presents a new dataset named WomenSports for women sports
classification using small-scale training data. This dataset includes a variety
of sports activities, covering wide variations in movements, environments, and
interactions among players. In addition, this study proposes a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for deep feature extraction. A channel attention scheme
upon local contextual regions is applied to refine and enhance feature
representation. The experiments are carried out on three different sports
datasets and one dance dataset for generalizing the proposed algorithm, and the
performances on these datasets are noteworthy. The deep learning method
achieves 89.15% top-1 classification accuracy using ResNet-50 on the proposed

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is essential for accurately
localizing and characterizing interactions between humans and objects,
providing a comprehensive understanding of complex visual scenes across various
domains. However, existing HOI detectors often struggle to deliver reliable
predictions efficiently, relying on resource-intensive training methods and
inefficient architectures. To address these challenges, we conceptualize a
wavelet attention-like backbone and a novel ray-based encoder architecture
tailored for HOI detection. Our wavelet backbone addresses the limitations of
expressing middle-order interactions by aggregating discriminative features
from the low- and high-order interactions extracted from diverse convolutional
filters. Concurrently, the ray-based encoder facilitates multi-scale attention
by optimizing the focus of the decoder on relevant regions of interest and
mitigating computational overhead. As a result of harnessing the attenuated
intensity of learnable ray origins, our decoder aligns query embeddings with
emphasized regions of interest for accurate predictions. Experimental results
on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and HICO-DET, showcase the potential
of our proposed architecture. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 残差学习是解决遮挡步态识别并保持完整步态性能的有效技术。

Abstract: Gait is becoming popular as a method of person re-identification because of
its ability to identify people at a distance. However, most current works in
gait recognition do not address the practical problem of occlusions. Among
those which do, some require paired tuples of occluded and holistic sequences,
which are impractical to collect in the real world. Further, these approaches
work on occlusions but fail to retain performance on holistic inputs. To
address these challenges, we propose RG-Gait, a method for residual correction
for occluded gait recognition with holistic retention. We model the problem as
a residual learning task, conceptualizing the occluded gait signature as a
residual deviation from the holistic gait representation. Our proposed network
adaptively integrates the learned residual, significantly improving performance
on occluded gait sequences without compromising the holistic recognition
accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Gait3D, GREW and BRIAR
datasets and show that learning the residual can be an effective technique to
tackle occluded gait recognition with holistic retention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代CNN和Transformer存在简单性偏好和信息冗余问题，限制了复杂结构特征的捕捉。

Method: SpaRTAN采用多尺度核和波式通道聚合模块，动态整合空间和通道信息。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上达到77.7%准确率（3.8M参数），COCO上50.0% AP（21.5M参数），性能优于基准。

Conclusion: SpaRTAN通过高效设计实现了高性能和参数效率，为视觉任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition
tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival
transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and
ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a
simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural
representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin
to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information
redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive
performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight
architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information
processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled
by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order
spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further
modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise
redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently
gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental
results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable
parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,
on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M
parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver
strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it
achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M
parameters. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 零样本异常检测在工业应用中需求广泛，但现有方法存在噪声和模糊性问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: FiSeCLIP结合特征匹配与跨模态对齐，利用批次内图像作为参考，并通过文本信息过滤噪声，同时恢复CLIP的局部语义相关性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD等基准测试中，FiSeCLIP在异常分类和分割任务上表现优异，AU-ROC和F1-max分别提升4.6%和5.7%。

Conclusion: FiSeCLIP为零样本异常检测提供了更强基线，展示了CLIP模型在细粒度任务中的潜力。

Abstract: With the advent of vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) in zero- and few-shot
settings, CLIP has been widely applied to zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) in
recent research, where the rare classes are essential and expected in many
applications. This study introduces \textbf{FiSeCLIP} for ZSAD with
training-free \textbf{CLIP}, combining the feature matching with the
cross-modal alignment. Testing with the entire dataset is impractical, while
batch-based testing better aligns with real industrial needs, and images within
a batch can serve as mutual reference points. Accordingly, FiSeCLIP utilizes
other images in the same batch as reference information for the current image.
However, the lack of labels for these references can introduce ambiguity, we
apply text information to \textbf{fi}lter out noisy features. In addition, we
further explore CLIP's inherent potential to restore its local
\textbf{se}mantic correlation, adapting it for fine-grained anomaly detection
tasks to enable a more accurate filtering process. Our approach exhibits
superior performance for both anomaly classification and segmentation on
anomaly detection benchmarks, building a stronger baseline for the direction,
e.g., on MVTec-AD, FiSeCLIP outperforms the SOTA AdaCLIP by
+4.6\%$\uparrow$/+5.7\%$\uparrow$ in segmentation metrics AU-ROC/$F_1$-max.

Conclusion: SISRNet能有效捕捉细微异常，减少数据偏差影响，生成临床准确的报告。

Abstract: Recent advances in automated radiology report generation from chest X-rays
using deep learning algorithms have the potential to significantly reduce the
arduous workload of radiologists. However, due to the inherent massive data
bias in radiology images, where abnormalities are typically subtle and sparsely
distributed, existing methods often produce fluent yet medically inaccurate
reports, limiting their applicability in clinical practice. To address this
issue effectively, we propose a Semantically Informed Salient Regions-guided
(SISRNet) report generation method. Specifically, our approach explicitly
identifies salient regions with medically critical characteristics using
fine-grained cross-modal semantics. Then, SISRNet systematically focuses on
these high-information regions during both image modeling and report
generation, effectively capturing subtle abnormal findings, mitigating the
negative impact of data bias, and ultimately generating clinically accurate
reports. Compared to its peers, SISRNet demonstrates superior performance on
widely used IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

*Sung Ho Kang,Hyun-Cheol Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Schrodinger Bridge的CBCT-to-MDCT转换框架，结合GAN先验和人类引导的条件扩散，确保解剖保真度和感知可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统GAN或扩散模型在医学图像转换中边界一致性和临床偏好对齐的不足。

Method: 结合GAN先验和人类反馈的条件扩散，通过迭代优化和锦标赛选择实现偏好学习。

Result: 在临床数据集上表现优异，RMSE、SSIM、LPIPS和Dice指标均优于现有方法，且仅需10步采样。

Conclusion: 该框架高效且有效，适用于实时、偏好对齐的医学图像转换。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for CBCT-to-MDCT translation, grounded in the
Schrodinger Bridge (SB) formulation, which integrates GAN-derived priors with
human-guided conditional diffusion. Unlike conventional GANs or diffusion
models, our approach explicitly enforces boundary consistency between CBCT
inputs and pseudo targets, ensuring both anatomical fidelity and perceptual
controllability. Binary human feedback is incorporated via classifier-free
guidance (CFG), effectively steering the generative process toward clinically
preferred outcomes. Through iterative refinement and tournament-based
preference selection, the model internalizes human preferences without relying
on a reward model. Subtraction image visualizations reveal that the proposed
method selectively attenuates shade artifacts in key anatomical regions while
preserving fine structural detail. Quantitative evaluations further demonstrate
superior performance across RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics on clinical
datasets -- outperforming prior GAN- and fine-tuning-based feedback methods --
while requiring only 10 sampling steps. These findings underscore the
effectiveness and efficiency of our framework for real-time, preference-aligned
medical image translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇语义分割方法无法识别用户个性化文本描述的特定区域（如“我的杯子”），需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出基于文本提示调优的插件方法，结合负掩模提案和视觉嵌入注入，增强个性化概念识别能力。

Result: 在FSS$^\text{per}$、CUB$^\text{per}$和ADE$^\text{per}$等新基准上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法在不影响原始开放词汇语义分割性能的前提下，显著提升了个性化概念的识别能力。

Abstract: While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into
semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes
unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug
cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper
addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'.
To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed
\textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text
prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual
concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the
performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false
predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our
proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts
other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by
enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of
the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS
without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the
superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task,
including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.

TL;DR: DGFDNet提出了一种双域去雾网络，结合空间和频率域信息，通过物理引导的退化对齐提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在单图像去雾中全局建模能力强，但计算成本高；现有方法依赖空间域特征，计算昂贵且效果有限。

Method: DGFDNet包含HAFM模块（基于暗通道先验生成雾霾置信图）和MGAM模块（多尺度特征融合），并通过PCGB分支迭代优化先验。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，DGFDNet实现了最优性能，兼具鲁棒性和实时性。

Conclusion: DGFDNet通过双域框架和物理引导，显著提升了去雾效果和效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in
single-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time
applicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features
to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and
often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce
frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches
limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the
Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel
dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment
across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two
key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a
pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance
haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware
spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which
fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid
gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior
Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback
mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed
features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in
challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze
datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and real-time efficiency. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态步态条件下足踝表面几何数据的准确采集具有挑战性，现有数据集通常关注全身或下肢运动，缺乏对足踝区域的详细建模。

Method: 使用自定义五相机深度传感系统采集46名受试者的8,403帧点云数据，包含完整5视角重建及部分视角点云。

Result: FootGait3D数据集支持单模态和多模态补全网络的基准测试，为足部几何恢复提供挑战性数据。

Conclusion: FootGait3D在生物力学、临床步态分析和机器人应用中具有重要潜力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: The kinematics analysis of foot-ankle complex during gait is essential for
advancing biomechanical research and clinical assessment. Collecting accurate
surface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is
inherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations.
Thus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of
high-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait.
Different from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or
lower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of
the ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address
this, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46
subjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a
complete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)
along with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.
This structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud
completion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset
is designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of
state-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and
multi-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the
challenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D
has significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment
foot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis,
prosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of
the foot during motion. The dataset is now available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProLearn提出了一种原型驱动的学习框架，通过语义近似模块减少对文本输入的依赖，提升了医学图像分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学语言引导的分割方法依赖成对的图像-文本输入，导致许多无文本数据无法利用，且限制了临床应用。

Method: 引入原型驱动的语义近似（PSA）模块，通过文本报告初始化原型空间，支持无文本图像的语义近似。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ProLearn在文本有限的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProLearn有效解决了文本依赖问题，提升了语言引导分割的适用性和性能。

Abstract: Medical language-guided segmentation, integrating textual clinical reports as
auxiliary guidance to enhance image segmentation, has demonstrated significant
improvements over unimodal approaches. However, its inherent reliance on paired
image-text input, which we refer to as ``textual reliance", presents two
fundamental limitations: 1) many medical segmentation datasets lack paired
reports, leaving a substantial portion of image-only data underutilized for
training; and 2) inference is limited to retrospective analysis of cases with
paired reports, limiting its applicability in most clinical scenarios where
segmentation typically precedes reporting. To address these limitations, we
propose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for
language-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance. At
its core, in ProLearn, we introduce a novel Prototype-driven Semantic
Approximation (PSA) module to enable approximation of semantic guidance from
textual input. PSA initializes a discrete and compact prototype space by
distilling segmentation-relevant semantics from textual reports. Once
initialized, it supports a query-and-respond mechanism which approximates
semantic guidance for images without textual input, thereby alleviating textual
reliance. Extensive experiments on QaTa-COV19, MosMedData+ and Kvasir-SEG
demonstrate that ProLearn outperforms state-of-the-art language-guided methods
when limited text is available.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在多视角2D部件分割和SDS损失模糊性方面的局限性，实现更精确的局部3D编辑。

Method: 提出3D-GALP模块生成鲁棒的3D掩码，并结合正则化SDS损失（包括L1锚定损失和其他正则化器）进行编辑。

Result: 实验表明，RoMaP在重建和生成的3D高斯场景中实现了最先进的局部编辑效果。

Conclusion: RoMaP为3D高斯编辑提供了更鲁棒和灵活的部件级修改能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D neural representations and instance-level editing
models have enabled the efficient creation of high-quality 3D content. However,
achieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian
Splatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently
ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these
limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that
enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a
robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction
(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model
view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and
consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a
regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional
regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled
Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality
part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region
while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as
Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond
the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.
Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local
3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects
qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and
flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

Conclusion: 基于关节角度的优化方法显著提升了HPE的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Marker-free human pose estimation (HPE) has found increasing applications in
various fields. Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint
recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing
kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models
for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in
which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method
to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key
techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is
robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation
of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground
truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a
post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet.
Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network
demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and
smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based
refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in
challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.

Abstract: Monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft is significant for
on-orbit service (OOS) tasks, such as satellite maintenance, space debris
removal, and station assembly. Considering the high demands on pose estimation
accuracy, mainstream monocular pose estimation methods typically consist of
keypoint detectors and PnP solver. However, current keypoint detectors remain
vulnerable to structural symmetry and partial occlusion of non-cooperative
spacecraft. To this end, we propose a graph-based keypoints network for the
monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft, GKNet, which leverages
the geometric constraint of keypoints graph. In order to better validate
keypoint detectors, we present a moderate-scale dataset for the spacecraft
keypoint detection, named SKD, which consists of 3 spacecraft targets, 90,000
simulated images, and corresponding high-precise keypoint annotations.
Extensive experiments and an ablation study have demonstrated the high accuracy
and effectiveness of our GKNet, compared to the state-of-the-art spacecraft
keypoint detectors. The code for GKNet and the SKD dataset is available at

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了RSD识别的自动化水平，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has become a rapid and non-destructive
solution for road subsurface distress (RSD) detection. However, RSD recognition
from GPR images is labor-intensive and heavily relies on inspectors' expertise.
Deep learning offers the possibility for automatic RSD recognition, but its
current performance is limited by two factors: Scarcity of high-quality dataset
for network training and insufficient capability of network to distinguish RSD.
In this study, a rigorously validated 3D GPR dataset containing 2134 samples of
diverse types was constructed through field scanning. Based on the finding that
the YOLO model trained with one of the three scans of GPR images exhibits
varying sensitivity to specific type of RSD, we proposed a novel
cross-verification strategy with outstanding accuracy in RSD recognition,
achieving recall over 98.6% in field tests. The approach, integrated into an
online RSD detection system, can reduce the labor of inspection by around 90%.

Conclusion: Atmos-Bench为卫星3D大气结构恢复设定了新标准，有助于更深入的气候研究。

Abstract: Atmospheric structure, represented by backscatter coefficients (BC) recovered
from satellite LiDAR attenuated backscatter (ATB), provides a volumetric view
of clouds, aerosols, and molecules, playing a critical role in human
activities, climate understanding, and extreme weather forecasting. Existing
methods often rely on auxiliary inputs and simplified physics-based
approximations, and lack a standardized 3D benchmark for fair evaluation.
However, such approaches may introduce additional uncertainties and
insufficiently capture realistic radiative transfer and atmospheric
scattering-absorption effects. To bridge these gaps, we present Atmos-Bench:
the first 3D atmospheric benchmark, along with a novel FourCastX:
Frequency-enhanced Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts Network that (a)
generates 921,600 image slices from 3D scattering volumes simulated at 532 nm
and 355 nm by coupling WRF with an enhanced COSP simulator over 384 land-ocean
time steps, yielding high-quality voxel-wise references; (b) embeds ATB-BC
physical constraints into the model architecture, promoting energy consistency
during restoration; (c) achieves consistent improvements on the Atmos-Bench
dataset across both 355 nm and 532 nm bands, outperforming state-of-the-art
baseline models without relying on auxiliary inputs. Atmos-Bench establishes a
new standard for satellite-based 3D atmospheric structure recovery and paves
the way for deeper climate insight.

Abstract: In this paper, we study task-oriented human grasp synthesis, a new grasp
synthesis task that demands both task and context awareness. At the core of our
method is the task-aware contact maps. Unlike traditional contact maps that
only reason about the manipulated object and its relation with the hand, our
enhanced maps take into account scene and task information. This comprehensive
map is critical for hand-object interaction, enabling accurate grasping poses
that align with the task. We propose a two-stage pipeline that first constructs
a task-aware contact map informed by the scene and task. In the subsequent
stage, we use this contact map to synthesize task-oriented human grasps. We
introduce a new dataset and a metric for the proposed task to evaluate our
approach. Our experiments validate the importance of modeling both scene and
task, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both
grasp quality and task performance. See our project page for more details:

Abstract: In recent years, visual recognition methods have advanced significantly,
finding applications across diverse fields. While researchers seek to
understand the mechanisms behind the success of these models, there is also a
growing impetus to deploy them in critical areas like autonomous driving and
medical diagnostics to better diagnose failures, which promotes the development
of interpretability research. This paper systematically reviews existing
research on the interpretability of visual recognition models and proposes a
taxonomy of methods from a human-centered perspective. The proposed taxonomy
categorizes interpretable recognition methods based on Intent, Object,
Presentation, and Methodology, thereby establishing a systematic and coherent
set of grouping criteria for these XAI methods. Additionally, we summarize the
requirements for evaluation metrics and explore new opportunities enabled by
recent technologies, such as large multimodal models. We aim to organize
existing research in this domain and inspire future investigations into the

Conclusion: KptLLM++为细粒度图像理解提供了统一解决方案，并推动了人机交互的变革。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized
image understanding by bridging textual and visual modalities. However, these
models often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as
the precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as
structure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,
particularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as
fine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In
this paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that
specifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the
integration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By
unifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself
as an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The
model is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first
interprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise
positions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push
the boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over
500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles,
and scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++
to unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate
its state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified
solution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative
implications for human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Jellyfish, a diverse group of gelatinous marine organisms, play a crucial
role in maintaining marine ecosystems but pose significant challenges for
biodiversity and conservation due to their rapid proliferation and ecological
impact. Accurate identification of jellyfish species is essential for
ecological monitoring and management. In this study, we proposed a deep
learning framework for jellyfish species detection and classification using an
underwater image dataset. The framework integrates advanced feature extraction
techniques, including MobileNetV3, ResNet50, EfficientNetV2-B0, and VGG16,
combined with seven traditional machine learning classifiers and three
Feedforward Neural Network classifiers for precise species identification.
Additionally, we activated the softmax function to directly classify jellyfish
species using the convolutional neural network models. The combination of the
Artificial Neural Network with MobileNetV3 is our best-performing model,
achieving an exceptional accuracy of 98%, significantly outperforming other
feature extractor-classifier combinations. This study demonstrates the efficacy
of deep learning and hybrid frameworks in addressing biodiversity challenges
and advancing species detection in marine environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态引导的难样本生成与学习框架（HSGL），通过结合文本和视觉模态，显式定义、生成和优化难样本，提升了服装变化行人重识别（CC-ReID）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 难样本在行人重识别任务中具有挑战性，尤其是在服装变化的场景下。其模糊性和相似性限制了针对性学习策略的设计，并降低了模型的鲁棒性。

Method: HSGL框架包含两个核心组件：1）双粒度难样本生成（DGHSG），利用多模态线索合成语义一致的样本；2）难样本自适应学习（HSAL），通过硬度感知优化策略调整特征距离。

Result: 在多个CC-ReID基准测试中表现优异，显著加速了学习过程，并在PRCC和LTCC数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 多模态引导的难样本生成与学习为鲁棒的CC-ReID提供了有效解决方案，具有显著的性能提升和收敛加速效果。

Abstract: Hard samples pose a significant challenge in person re-identification (ReID)
tasks, particularly in clothing-changing person Re-ID (CC-ReID). Their inherent
ambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes
them a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of
targeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under
clothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which
is the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly
define, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL
comprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation
(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent
samples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives
for effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)
Hard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware
optimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic
labels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives
closer in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability
and robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the
potential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust
CC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the
targeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
PRCC and LTCC datasets. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过多模态线索感知世界，但不同模态间的固有差异（如属性差异和粒度差异）带来了挑战，需要一种方法来解决这些冲突并提升多模态场景的理解能力。

Method: 提出MMOne框架，包括模态建模模块（使用模态指示器捕捉各模态独特属性）和多模态分解机制（将多模态高斯分布分解为单模态高斯分布）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著提升各模态的表示能力，并可扩展到更多模态。

Conclusion: MMOne框架有效解决了多模态场景表示中的模态冲突问题，提供了一种紧凑高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Humans perceive the world through multimodal cues to understand and interact
with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities
enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts,
arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two
critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address
these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple
modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional
modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality
indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.
Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate
multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality
differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by
disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific
components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene
representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to
additional modalities. The code is available at

Abstract: In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the
extreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of
human activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural
resources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the
extremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or
highland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model
which explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide
events. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain
free resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote
sensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for
two tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our
proposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie,
and Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23,
93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU
scores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense,
Nepal datasets. These experimental results prove potential to integrate our
proposed model into real-life landslide observation systems.

Abstract: Automatic Target Detection (ATD) and Recognition (ATR) from Thermal Infrared
(TI) imagery in the defense and surveillance domain is a challenging computer
vision (CV) task in comparison to the commercial autonomous vehicle perception
domain. Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific
challenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater
distances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution
and resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather,
temperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios
all result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class
similarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly,
contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform
in the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector,
called YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the
detection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile.
We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR
dataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing
protocols. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art ATR performance of up to 99.6%.

Abstract: Citrus, as one of the most economically important fruit crops globally,
suffers severe yield depressions due to various diseases. Accurate disease
detection and classification serve as critical prerequisites for implementing
targeted control measures. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence,
particularly deep learning-based computer vision algorithms, have substantially
decreased time and labor requirements while maintaining the accuracy of
detection and classification. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly rely on
massive, high-quality annotated training examples to attain promising
performance. By introducing two key designs: contrasting with cluster centroids
and a multi-layer contrastive training (MCT) paradigm, this paper proposes a
novel clustering-guided self-supervised multi-layer contrastive representation
learning (CMCRL) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates several advantages
over existing counterparts: (1) optimizing with massive unannotated samples;
(2) effective adaptation to the symptom similarity across distinct citrus
diseases; (3) hierarchical feature representation learning. The proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public citrus image set CDD,
outperforming existing methods by 4.5\%-30.1\% accuracy. Remarkably, our method
narrows the performance gap with fully supervised counterparts (all samples are
labeled). Beyond classification accuracy, our method shows great performance on
other evaluation metrics (F1 score, precision, and recall), highlighting the
robustness against the class imbalance challenge.

Result: 1. 通用大模型在某些任务上优于医学专用模型；2. 推理能力普遍较弱；3. 不同基准测试性能差异大。

Conclusion: 当前模型未达到临床部署的可靠性标准，需加强多模态对齐和更严格的评估协议。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale corpora excel at natural
image tasks and are increasingly repurposed for healthcare; however, their
competence in medical tasks remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive
evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs,
ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert,
OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model
performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding
and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large
general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts
on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to
medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than
understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third,
performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task
design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the
reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for
stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation
protocols.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) tasks have made significant progress with the advent of
Deep Neural Networks, particularly through margin-based triplet losses that
embed facial images into high-dimensional feature spaces. During training,
these contrastive losses focus exclusively on identity information as labels.
However, we observe a multiscale geometric structure emerging in the embedding
space, influenced by interpretable facial (e.g., hair color) and image
attributes (e.g., contrast). We propose a geometric approach to describe the
dependence or invariance of FR models to these attributes and introduce a
physics-inspired alignment metric. We evaluate the proposed metric on
controlled, simplified models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with
synthetic data for targeted attribute augmentation. Our findings reveal that
the models exhibit varying degrees of invariance across different attributes,
providing insight into their strengths and weaknesses and enabling deeper
interpretability. Code available here:

Conclusion: MCULoRA为不完整多模态学习提供了一种高效参数训练框架，具有优越性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) often encounters incomplete
multimodality in practical applications due to sensor failures or privacy
protection requirements. While existing methods attempt to address various
incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality
combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical
limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict
with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction
model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank
adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a
novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal
learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination
aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The
MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct
characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts
the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each
modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across
different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms
previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.

Conclusion: NarrLV为长视频生成模型的叙事能力提供了首个全面评估工具，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long
video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to
expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long
video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to
accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due
to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video
generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on
benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our
knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively
evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.
Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative
unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative
Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.
Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we
construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing
evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based
on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an
effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and
answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on
existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human
judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability
boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

Result: 在两个医学影像数据集上，COLI在PSNR和SSIM指标上表现优异，压缩速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: COLI为高效压缩大图像提供了新思路，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery
amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional
techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while
data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural
Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous
mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images,
thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the
generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces
challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios.
To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images),
a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First,
recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we
accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm,
mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a
parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image
storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a
novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while
maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging
datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior
PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while
accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.

Abstract: Within a legal framework, fairness in datasets and models is typically
assessed by dividing observations into predefined groups and then computing
fairness measures (e.g., Disparate Impact or Equality of Odds with respect to
gender). However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,
dividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination
experienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we
propose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly
multidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed
levels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a
novel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby
isolating the most critical subgroups.
  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and
demonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing
how discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.
Furthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the
case of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging
the skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that
the proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than
previously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for
a given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,
aiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing. The
results demonstrate that our approach improves fairness while having minimal
impact on accuracy, thus confirming our partition method and opening the door
for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Colors are omnipresent in today's world and play a vital role in how humans
perceive and interact with their surroundings. However, it is challenging for
computers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human
Perception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based
Representation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between
computational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed
model uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.
Using a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies
distinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through
preliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey
involving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract
fuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world
perceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that
allows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative
evaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to
traditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for
color attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable
sample of the human population (n = 2496). Our findings are significant for
fields such as design, artificial intelligence, marketing, and human-computer
interaction, where perceptually relevant color representation is critical.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to identify and localize objects in a 3D space based
on textual descriptions. However, existing methods struggle with disentangling
targets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving
inconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To
tackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D
visual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the
Simple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor
queries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a
structured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional
relationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the
Multi-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates
textual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal
Consistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a
Textual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a
unified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding
datasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

Conclusion: 该模型为可扩展和交互式4D视觉系统提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a
fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and
real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer
that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We
explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer
architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal
causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to
enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle
real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information
while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we
propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry
grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model
supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g.,
FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments
on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model
increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive
performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

Solanum lycopersicum using an Internet of Things (IoT) based imaging system
with standardized data acquisition protocols. Our dataset contains 64,464 RGB
images that capture 12 different plant poses from four camera elevation angles.
Each image includes manually annotated bounding boxes for seven regions of
interest (ROIs), including leaves, panicle, batch of flowers, batch of fruits,
axillary shoot, shoot and whole plant area, along with 50 fine-grained growth
stage classifications based on the BBCH scale. Additionally, we provide 3,616

Through AI vs. Human analysis involving five domain experts, we demonstrate
that the models trained on our dataset achieve accuracy and speed comparable to
the experts. Cohen's Kappa and inter-rater agreement heatmap confirm the
reliability of automated fine-grained phenotyping using our approach.

Abstract: Fluvial erosion is a natural process that can generate significant impacts on
soil stability and strategic infrastructures. The detection and monitoring of
this phenomenon is traditionally addressed by photogrammetric methods and
analysis in geographic information systems. These tasks require specific
knowledge and intensive manual processing. This study proposes an artificial
intelligence-based approach for automatic identification of eroded zones and
estimation of their area. The state-of-the-art computer vision model YOLOv11,
adjusted by fine-tuning and trained with photographs and LiDAR images, is used.
This combined dataset was segmented and labeled using the Roboflow platform.
Experimental results indicate efficient detection of erosion patterns with an
accuracy of 70%, precise identification of eroded areas and reliable
calculation of their extent in pixels and square meters. As a final product,
the EROSCAN system has been developed, an interactive web application that
allows users to upload images and obtain automatic segmentations of fluvial
erosion, together with the estimated area. This tool optimizes the detection
and quantification of the phenomenon, facilitating decision making in risk
management and territorial planning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的高斯泼溅框架，首次引入多种几何基元以提高表面重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法仅使用单一基元（椭圆或椭球）表示复杂物体表面，导致重建质量不足。

Result: 实验证明该框架能显著提升表面重建的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过引入多种几何基元，新框架在高斯泼溅中实现了更高质量的物体表面重建。

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has received a lot of attention in surface
reconstruction. However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes
in the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type
of splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent
object surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that
this can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality.
Thus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian
Splatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its
surface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first
propose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and
rendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline.
In addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based
initialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its
surface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging
different types of primitives. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our
framework and its accurate surface reconstruction performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MVS方法在纹理缺失和反射表面等区域表现不佳，而单目深度估计无需特征匹配，具有鲁棒性。

Method: 提出MonoMVSNet，集成单目特征和深度到多视角几何中，使用注意力机制和动态深度候选更新。

Result: 在DTU和Tanks-and-Temples数据集上达到最优性能，排名第一。

Conclusion: MonoMVSNet通过结合单目和多视角信息，显著提升了MVS在挑战性区域的性能。

Abstract: Learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods aim to predict depth maps for
a sequence of calibrated images to recover dense point clouds. However,
existing MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as
textureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In
contrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature
matching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these
regions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature
and depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular
foundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of
the reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention
mechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the
monocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the
depth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a
relative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to
supervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and
Tanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate
and Advanced benchmarks. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕基准和模型过于视觉中心化，忽视了音频在场景动态、说话者意图和叙事背景中的关键作用，缺乏全面的数据集和轻量级模型。

Method: 通过三阶段人工标注流程（音频、视觉、联合模态）构建数据集，并提出UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B)模型，采用两阶段训练策略（监督微调+GRPO）。

Result: UGC-VideoCap包含1000个TikTok视频和4000个QA对，模型在有限数据下表现高效且性能优异。

Conclusion: UGC-VideoCap为真实场景下的多模态视频字幕提供了高质量基准和数据高效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world user-generated videos, especially on platforms like TikTok, often
feature rich and intertwined audio visual content. However, existing video
captioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric,
overlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker
intent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight,
capable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video
understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new
benchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal
captioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets,
UGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities,
featuring 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage
human-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio
visual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs
probing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we
propose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from
Gemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine
tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach
enables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive
performance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation
and a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in
unconstrained real-world UGC settings.

Result: VAR在非差分隐私适应中表现优于扩散模型，但在差分隐私适应中性能下降。

Conclusion: VAR在非隐私任务中表现优异，但需进一步研究差分隐私适应策略。

Abstract: Vision AutoRegressive model (VAR) was recently introduced as an alternative
to Diffusion Models (DMs) in image generation domain. In this work we focus on
its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific
downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many
techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially
private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation
data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In
our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them
to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms
DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which
necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR. Code is available

Motivation: 传统统计形状建模方法依赖线性假设，难以表达复杂血管拓扑结构，限制了其在心血管诊断和治疗规划中的应用。

Method: HUG-VAS结合NURBS参数化和扩散生成模型，采用分层架构：一个扩散模型生成中心线，另一个生成基于中心线的径向轮廓，从而捕捉解剖变异性。

Result: 模型在21个患者样本上训练，生成的主动脉几何结构具有解剖学真实性，生物标志物分布与原始数据集高度匹配。

Conclusion: HUG-VAS首次通过NURBS参数化和分层扩散过程，将图像先验与生成形状建模统一结合，支持零样本条件生成，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of vascular geometry is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional statistical shape
modeling (SSM) methods rely on linear assumptions, limiting their expressivity
and scalability to complex topologies such as multi-branch vascular structures.
We introduce HUG-VAS, a Hierarchical NURBS Generative model for Vascular
geometry Synthesis, which integrates NURBS surface parameterization with
diffusion-based generative modeling to synthesize realistic, fine-grained
aortic geometries. Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates
anatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker
distributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts
a hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that
generates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial
profiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of
anatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot
conditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical
applications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust
reconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device
optimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge
image-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration
of NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes.

Conclusion: 3C-FBI在精度、速度和鲁棒性上表现优异，适用于医疗影像、机器人和工业检测。

Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental computer vision challenge of robust
circle detection and fitting in degraded imaging conditions. We present
Combinatorial Convolution-based Circle Fitting for Blurry Images (3C-FBI), an
algorithm that bridges the gap between circle detection and precise parametric
fitting by combining (1) efficient combinatorial edge pixel (edgel) sampling
and (2) convolution-based density estimation in parameter space.
  We evaluate 3C-FBI across three experimental frameworks: (1) real-world
medical data from Parkinson's disease assessments (144 frames from 36 videos),
(2) controlled synthetic data following established circle-fitting benchmarks,
and (3) systematic analysis across varying spatial resolutions and outlier
contamination levels. Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3
fps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a
standard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost
1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher
than 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.
  In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989
across contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al. (2024,
0.991), and surpassing RHT (0.964). This combination of accuracy, speed, and
robustness makes 3C-FBI ideal for medical imaging, robotics, and industrial
inspection under challenging conditions.

Abstract: EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promise in various
applications, such as motor imagery and cognitive state monitoring. However,
decoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant
challenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel
5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an
EEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and
text embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking,
(4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer
semantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.
We enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment
and re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches
by 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and
reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic

Conclusion: CharaConsist是首个针对DiT模型的文本到图像一致生成方法，扩展了实际应用范围。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, producing a series of consistent contents that
preserve the same identity is highly valuable for real-world applications.
Although a few works have explored training-free methods to enhance the
consistency of generated subjects, we observe that they suffer from the
following problems. First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,
which limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character
undergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing
details become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist,
which employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with
decoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables
fine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the
generation of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in
discrete shots across different scenes. Moreover, CharaConsist is the first
consistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model. Its ability
to maintain fine-grained consistency, combined with the larger capacity of
latest base model, enables it to produce high-quality visual outputs,
broadening its applicability to a wider range of real-world scenarios. The

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for
applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics,
autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on
hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution,
and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising
alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to
either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific
and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models
in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models":
deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot
generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning
architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo,
multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these
models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of
large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key
architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards
robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research
and applications.

Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant threat in today's digital world, often
spreading rapidly through platforms like YouTube. This paper introduces a novel
approach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that
not only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages
users in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system

Google FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced
and comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender
leverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to
generate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive
debate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to
iteratively improve its style and refine its output.
  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established
benchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its
potential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings
highlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the
potential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering
a more informed online space.

Abstract: Mental health plays a crucial role in the overall well-being of an
individual. In recent years, digital platforms have been increasingly used to
expand mental health and emotional support. However, there are persistent
challenges related to limited user accessibility, internet connectivity, and
data privacy, which highlight the need for an offline, smartphone-based
solution. To address these challenges, we propose EmoSApp (Emotional Support
App): an entirely offline, smartphone-based conversational app designed for
mental health and emotional support. The system leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically fine-tuned, quantized and deployed using Torchtune and
Executorch for resource-constrained devices, allowing all inferences to occur
on the smartphone. To equip EmoSApp with robust domain expertise, we fine-tuned
the LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct model on our custom curated ``Knowledge dataset'' of
14,582 mental-health QA pairs, along with the multi-turn conversational data.
  Through qualitative human evaluation with the student population, we
demonstrate that EmoSApp has the ability to respond coherently, empathetically,
maintain interactive dialogue, and provide relevant suggestions to user's
mental health problems. Additionally, quantitative evaluations on nine standard
commonsense and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our
fine-tuned, quantized model in low-resource settings. By prioritizing on-device
deployment and specialized domain adaptation, EmoSApp serves as a blueprint for
future innovations in portable, secure, and highly tailored AI-driven mental
health solutions.

*Anders Ledberg,Anna Thalén*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模块化工具链，利用开源模型处理敏感文本数据，解决隐私和异构性问题，适用于大规模研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律、医疗和行政领域的非结构化文本是公共卫生和社会科学研究的重要资源，但敏感信息和数据异构性限制了其利用。

Method: 使用大型语言模型（LLM）进行文本标准化、摘要和翻译，结合命名实体识别和基于规则的方法实现匿名化。

Result: 工具链在瑞典法院判决数据集上验证有效，能够匿名化并保留语义内容，支持半自动化内容分析。

Conclusion: 该工具链为隐私敏感领域的大规模文本分析提供了新可能。

Abstract: Unstructured text from legal, medical, and administrative sources offers a
rich but underutilized resource for research in public health and the social
sciences. However, large-scale analysis is hampered by two key challenges: the
presence of sensitive, personally identifiable information, and significant
heterogeneity in structure and language. We present a modular toolchain that
prepares such text data for embedding-based analysis, relying entirely on
open-weight models that run on local hardware, requiring only a
workstation-level GPU and supporting privacy-sensitive research.
  The toolchain employs large language model (LLM) prompting to standardize,
summarize, and, when needed, translate texts to English for greater
comparability. Anonymization is achieved via LLM-based redaction, supplemented
with named entity recognition and rule-based methods to minimize the risk of
disclosure. We demonstrate the toolchain on a corpus of 10,842 Swedish court
decisions under the Care of Abusers Act (LVM), comprising over 56,000 pages.
Each document is processed into an anonymized, standardized summary and
transformed into a document-level embedding. Validation, including manual
review, automated scanning, and predictive evaluation shows the toolchain
effectively removes identifying information while retaining semantic content.
As an illustrative application, we train a predictive model using embedding
vectors derived from a small set of manually labeled summaries, demonstrating
the toolchain's capacity for semi-automated content analysis at scale.
  By enabling structured, privacy-conscious analysis of sensitive documents,
our toolchain opens new possibilities for large-scale research in domains where
textual data was previously inaccessible due to privacy and heterogeneity
constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种更新的XAI分类法，专注于基于提示的自然语言解释（NLEs），以支持透明AI系统的治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的兴起，NLEs成为解释模型行为的关键工具，需要对其特性和治理影响进行系统研究。

Method: 基于可解释AI（XAI）文献，构建了一个三维度分类法：上下文、生成与呈现、评估。

Result: 分类法为研究者、审计者和政策制定者提供了设计和改进NLEs的框架。

Conclusion: 该分类法有助于提升AI系统的透明度和治理效果。

Abstract: Effective AI governance requires structured approaches for stakeholders to
access and verify AI system behavior. With the rise of large language models,
Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) are now key to articulating model
behavior, which necessitates a focused examination of their characteristics and
governance implications. We draw on Explainable AI (XAI) literature to create
an updated XAI taxonomy, adapted to prompt-based NLEs, across three dimensions:
(1) Context, including task, data, audience, and goals; (2) Generation and
Presentation, covering generation methods, inputs, interactivity, outputs, and
forms; and (3) Evaluation, focusing on content, presentation, and user-centered
properties, as well as the setting of the evaluation. This taxonomy provides a
framework for researchers, auditors, and policymakers to characterize, design,
and enhance NLEs for transparent AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoRAG-LoRA是一个模块化框架，通过LoRA适配器和KL正则化训练减少大语言模型的幻觉问题，同时保持高效性和模块化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但存在幻觉问题（事实错误），影响实际部署的信任度。

Method: 结合自动提示重写、混合检索和低秩适配器调优，通过KL正则化训练和幻觉检测模块（分类器和自评估技术）生成置信度分数，并可选反馈校正循环。

Result: AutoRAG-LoRA显著减少了事实漂移，同时保持了模型的高效性和模块化。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了大语言模型的幻觉问题，提升了生成内容的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fluency across a
range of natural language tasks, yet remain vulnerable to hallucinations -
factual inaccuracies that undermine trust in real world deployment. We present
AutoRAG-LoRA, a modular framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that
tackles hallucination in large language models through lightweight LoRA-based
adapters and KL-regularized training. Our pipeline integrates automated prompt
rewriting, hybrid retrieval, and low-rank adapter tuning to ground responses in
retrieved evidence. A hallucination detection module, using both
classifier-based and self-evaluation techniques, assigns confidence scores to
generated outputs, triggering an optional feedback correction loop. This loop
enforces factual alignment via contrastive KL loss and adapter fine tuning. We
demonstrate that AutoRAG-LoRA significantly reduces the factual drift while
preserving the efficiency and modularity of the model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过语言模型表达不确定性以增强用户信任，提出了一种模仿人类沟通的“拟人化不确定性”方法，并分析了现有研究的局限性和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语言模型常以过度自信的方式输出结果，即使准确性存疑，这削弱了其可信度。因此，需要通过语言表达模型的不确定性，以促进人机协作并减少潜在危害。

Method: 提出“拟人化不确定性”概念，强调通过模仿人类沟通方式实现直观且可信的不确定性表达。综述了人类不确定性沟通的研究，并分析了数据偏见。

Result: 研究发现现有自然语言处理研究忽视了人类不确定性沟通的细微差别和数据偏见，需进一步探索拟人化方法。

Conclusion: 论文指出了人机不确定性沟通的独特因素，并将拟人化不确定性分解为未来自然语言处理的研究方向。

Abstract: Human users increasingly rely on natural language interactions with large
language models (LLMs) in order to receive help on a large variety of tasks and
problems. However, the trustworthiness and perceived legitimacy of LLMs is
undermined by the fact that their output is frequently stated in very confident
terms, even when its accuracy is questionable. Therefore, there is a need to
signal the confidence of the language model to a user in order to reap the
benefits of human-machine collaboration and mitigate potential harms.
Verbalized uncertainty is the expression of confidence with linguistic means,
an approach that integrates perfectly into language-based interfaces.
Nevertheless, most recent research in natural language processing (NLP)
overlooks the nuances surrounding human uncertainty communication and the data
biases that influence machine uncertainty communication. We argue for
anthropomimetic uncertainty, meaning that intuitive and trustworthy uncertainty
communication requires a degree of linguistic authenticity and personalization
to the user, which could be achieved by emulating human communication. We
present a thorough overview over the research in human uncertainty
communication, survey ongoing research, and perform additional analyses to
demonstrate so-far overlooked biases in verbalized uncertainty. We conclude by
pointing out unique factors in human-machine communication of uncertainty and
deconstruct anthropomimetic uncertainty into future research directions for
NLP.

### [108] [PLEX: Perturbation-free Local Explanations for LLM-Based Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10596)
*Yogachandran Rahulamathavan,Misbah Farooq,Varuna De Silva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLEX是一种无需扰动的局部解释方法，通过上下文嵌入和Siamese网络高效生成解释，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在文本分类中表现优异，但其复杂性导致可解释性差，现有方法（如LIME和SHAP）计算成本高。

Method: 提出PLEX方法，利用LLM的上下文嵌入和Siamese网络，无需后续扰动即可生成解释。

Result: 在四个分类任务中，PLEX与LIME和SHAP的一致性超过92%，计算效率提升显著。

Conclusion: PLEX为LLM的文本分类提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text classification, but their
complexity hinders interpretability, making it difficult to understand the
reasoning behind their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods like LIME and
SHAP offer local explanations by identifying influential words, but they rely
on computationally expensive perturbations. These methods typically generate
thousands of perturbed sentences and perform inferences on each, incurring a
substantial computational burden, especially with LLMs. To address this, we
propose \underline{P}erturbation-free \underline{L}ocal \underline{Ex}planation
(PLEX), a novel method that leverages the contextual embeddings extracted from
the LLM and a ``Siamese network" style neural network trained to align with
feature importance scores. This one-off training eliminates the need for
subsequent perturbations, enabling efficient explanations for any new sentence.
We demonstrate PLEX's effectiveness on four different classification tasks
(sentiment, fake news, fake COVID-19 news and depression), showing more than
92\% agreement with LIME and SHAP. Our evaluation using a ``stress test"
reveals that PLEX accurately identifies influential words, leading to a similar
decline in classification accuracy as observed with LIME and SHAP when these
words are removed. Notably, in some cases, PLEX demonstrates superior
performance in capturing the impact of key features. PLEX dramatically
accelerates explanation, reducing time and computational overhead by two and
four orders of magnitude, respectively. This work offers a promising solution
for explainable LLM-based text classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）能自然形成与人类心理模型一致的情感层次结构，且模型越大层次越复杂。同时，模型在情感识别上存在社会经济身份的偏见，尤其是对交叉性、代表性不足的群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何建模用户情感状态对于其伦理部署至关重要，尤其是基于心理学情感轮的理论框架。

Method: 通过分析模型输出中情感状态的概率依赖关系，结合人类心理学模型进行研究。

Result: LLMs形成的情感层次结构与人类心理模型一致，且大模型层次更复杂；同时发现情感识别中的系统性偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs内化了社会感知的某些方面，研究为基于认知理论的模型评估提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly power conversational agents,
understanding how they model users' emotional states is critical for ethical
deployment. Inspired by emotion wheels -- a psychological framework that argues
emotions organize hierarchically -- we analyze probabilistic dependencies
between emotional states in model outputs. We find that LLMs naturally form
hierarchical emotion trees that align with human psychological models, and
larger models develop more complex hierarchies. We also uncover systematic
biases in emotion recognition across socioeconomic personas, with compounding
misclassifications for intersectional, underrepresented groups. Human studies
reveal striking parallels, suggesting that LLMs internalize aspects of social
perception. Beyond highlighting emergent emotional reasoning in LLMs, our
results hint at the potential of using cognitively-grounded theories for
developing better model evaluations.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何利用语言建模方法分析成人服务网站（ASW）广告文本，以识别性交易受害者，并开发了高效的定制Transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASW广告文本因使用表情符号、语法混乱和故意模糊而难以分析，但却是识别性交易受害者的关键数据。

Method: 研究了多种语言建模方法，包括信息检索、预训练Transformer和定制Transformer模型，并评估了其性能。

Result: 定制Transformer模型在准确性、召回率、F1分数和ROC AUC上优于BERT-base、RoBERTa和ModernBERT等模型。

Conclusion: 开发的模型显著提升了ASW文本分析能力，可用于多种下游应用和研究。

Abstract: Sex trafficking refers to the use of force, fraud, or coercion to compel an
individual to perform in commercial sex acts against their will. Adult service
websites (ASWs) have and continue to be linked to sex trafficking, offering a
platform for traffickers to advertise their victims. Thus, organizations
involved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when
attempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge
in transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous
research using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking
ads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of
emojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement
scrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for
this application area, including simple information retrieval methods,
pre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that
characteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to
be trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for
inference on consumer hardware. Our custom models outperform fine-tuned
variants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base,
RoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We
demonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks
related to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph
representation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the
learned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context
we study. The models we develop represent a significant advancement in ASW text
analysis, which can be leveraged in a variety of downstream applications and
research.

Abstract: Labeled property graphs often contain rich textual attributes that can
enhance analytical tasks when properly leveraged. This work explores the use of
pretrained text embedding models to enable efficient semantic analysis in such
graphs. By embedding textual node and edge properties, we support downstream
tasks including node classification and relation prediction with improved
contextual understanding. Our approach integrates language model embeddings
into the graph pipeline without altering its structure, demonstrating that
textual semantics can significantly enhance the accuracy and interpretability
of property graph analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，社交平台上的仇恨言论并不因获得更多点赞而增加或变得更极端。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社交认可对在线仇恨言论的影响，验证Walter的社会认可理论。

Method: 分析2018-2021年Parler平台的1.1亿条帖子，研究点赞与后续仇恨言论的关系。

Result: 点赞数与后续仇恨言论无显著关联，甚至在某些情况下呈负相关。

Conclusion: 社交认可对仇恨言论的强化机制在特定平台上可能不同。

Abstract: In this paper, we explored how online hate is motivated by receiving social
approval from others. We specifically examined two central tenets of Walther's
(2024) social approval theory of online hate: (H1a) more signals of social
approval on hate messages predicts more subsequent hate messages, and (H1b) as
social approval increases, hate speech messages become more extreme. Using over
110 million posts from Parler (2018-2021), we observed that the number of
upvotes a person received on a hate speech post was unassociated with the
amount of hate speech in their next post and posts during the next week, month,
three months, and six months. Between-person effects revealed an average
negative relationship between social approval and hate speech production at the
post level, but this relationship was mixed at other time intervals. Social
approval reinforcement mechanisms of online hate may operate differently on
niche social media platforms.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在司法系统中的公平性，提出了一个评估框架，发现LLMs普遍存在不一致性、偏见和不平衡的准确性，并开发了一个公开工具包以支持未来研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险领域的应用日益广泛，但其司法公平性和对社会正义的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 基于司法公平理论构建评估框架，开发了三个评估指标（不一致性、偏见和不平衡准确性），并在16个LLMs上进行了实验。

Result: 实验发现LLMs普遍存在不公平问题，特别是在人口统计标签上偏见更明显。调整温度参数可影响公平性，但模型规模、发布时间和来源国无显著影响。

Conclusion: LLMs在司法系统中的公平性存在严重问题，需进一步研究和改进。公开工具包为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes fields
where their decisions impact rights and equity. However, LLMs' judicial
fairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs
act as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite
to ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we
construct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a
selection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to
the judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising
177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop
three evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and
introduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across
various labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive
inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring
severe LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more
pronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance
labels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency
correlates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate
biases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence
LLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit
significant effects on judicial fairness. Accordingly, we introduce a publicly
available toolkit containing all datasets and code, designed to support future
research in evaluating and improving LLM fairness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了对话生成中主观与客观风格相似性的区别及其对用户偏好的影响，并发布了相关数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究用户与系统之间的风格相似性对用户印象的影响，区分主观与客观相似性。

Method: 构建包含用户偏好、主观风格相似性和客观风格相似性的数据集，并进行相关性分析。

Result: 发现主观风格相似性与用户偏好呈强正相关，且主观与客观相似性存在差异。

Conclusion: 强调区分主观与客观评价的重要性，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Recent advancements in dialogue generation have broadened the scope of
human-bot interactions, enabling not only contextually appropriate responses
but also the analysis of human affect and sensitivity. While prior work has
suggested that stylistic similarity between user and system may enhance user
impressions, the distinction between subjective and objective similarity is
often overlooked. To investigate this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that
includes users' preferences, subjective stylistic similarity based on users'
own perceptions, and objective stylistic similarity annotated by third party
evaluators in open-domain dialogue settings. Analysis using the constructed
dataset reveals a strong positive correlation between subjective stylistic
similarity and user preference. Furthermore, our analysis suggests an important
finding: users' subjective stylistic similarity differs from third party
objective similarity. This underscores the importance of distinguishing between
subjective and objective evaluations and understanding the distinct aspects
each captures when analyzing the relationship between stylistic similarity and
user preferences. The dataset presented in this paper is available online.

TL;DR: HanjaBridge通过注入汉字的语义信息，解决了韩语中同音异义词的歧义问题，显著提升了低资源语言模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决韩语中同音异义词（如汉字词）在韩文字母中无法区分的问题，提升低资源语言模型的性能。

Method: 提出HanjaBridge技术，在持续预训练框架中注入所有可能的汉字候选，结合知识蒸馏避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在KoBALT基准上相对提升21%，并观察到跨语言迁移的积极效果。

Conclusion: HanjaBridge不仅提升了韩语理解能力，还无需推理时额外成本，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often show poor performance in low-resource
languages like Korean, partly due to unique linguistic challenges such as
homophonous Sino-Korean words that are indistinguishable in Hangul script. To
address this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel
meaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT)
framework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja
(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja
candidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual
disambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation
to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge
significantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\% relative
improvement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment
between Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive
cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, these gains persist even when Hanja
augmentation is omitted at inference time, ensuring practical efficiency with
no additional run-time cost.

Conclusion: 结论指出，LLMs在类比推理方面有潜力，但仍需改进以更接近人类认知能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought them closer
to matching human cognition across a variety of tasks. How well do these models
align with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies? Prior research
has shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack
robust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the
current study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a
fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human
performance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in
LLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity
between the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity
between the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the
effectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we
examine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in
humans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and
not just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our
experiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters)
and performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as
GPT-4 and LLaMA3. This work advances our understanding of the analogical
reasoning abilities of LLMs and their potential as models of human reasoning.

agreement and internal consistency. Our prompt design methodology aligned model
outputs with BDI-II criteria and enabled the analysis of conversational cues
that influenced the prediction of symptoms. Our best submission, second on the
official leaderboard, achieved DCHR = 0.50, ADODL = 0.89, and ASHR = 0.27.

Abstract: Large language models, with their strong reasoning ability and rich
knowledge, have brought revolution to many tasks of AI, but their impact on
sign language generation remains limited due to its complexity and unique
rules. In this paper, we propose TEAch Me Sign (TEAM-Sign), treating sign
language as another natural language. By fine-tuning an LLM, we enable it to
learn the correspondence between text and sign language, and facilitate
generation. Considering the differences between sign and spoken language, we
employ a stepwise prompting strategy to extract the inherent sign language
knowledge within the LLM, thereby supporting the learning and generation
process. Experimental results on How2Sign and Phoenix14T datasets demonstrate
that our approach effectively leverages both the sign language knowledge and
reasoning capabilities of LLM to align the different distribution and
grammatical rules between sign and spoken language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本性别歧视检测任务，特别是在多语言和多子任务场景下，同时减少计算和存储开销。

Method: 采用分层LoRA适配器，对所有线性变换进行适应，并通过条件路由建模标签依赖关系，使用统一多语言训练策略。

Result: 在仅使用1.67%可训练参数的情况下，性能接近全微调，训练时间减少75%，存储减少98%，并在所有子任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了参数高效微调在多语言性别歧视检测中的潜力，显著降低了资源需求并保持了高性能。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to EXIST 2025 Task 1, addressing text-based
sexism detection in English and Spanish tweets through hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) of Llama 3.1 8B. Our method introduces conditional adapter
routing that explicitly models label dependencies across three hierarchically
structured subtasks: binary sexism identification, source intention detection,
and multilabel sexism categorization. Unlike conventional LoRA applications
that target only attention layers, we apply adaptation to all linear
transformations, enhancing the model's capacity to capture task-specific
patterns. In contrast to complex data processing and ensemble approaches, we
show that straightforward parameter-efficient fine-tuning achieves strong
performance. We train separate LoRA adapters (rank=16, QLoRA 4-bit) for each
subtask using unified multilingual training that leverages Llama 3.1's native
bilingual capabilities. The method requires minimal preprocessing and uses
standard supervised learning. Our multilingual training strategy eliminates the
need for separate language-specific models, achieving 1.7-2.4\% F1 improvements
through cross-lingual transfer. With only 1.67\% trainable parameters compared
to full fine-tuning, our approach reduces training time by 75\% and model
storage by 98\%, while achieving competitive performance across all subtasks
(ICM-Hard: 0.6774 for binary classification, 0.4991 for intention detection,
0.6519 for multilabel categorization).

Motivation: 解决现有立场检测研究局限于短文本和高资源语言的问题，以促进新闻推荐中的观点多样性。

Method: 提出JoA-ICL框架，利用语言模型代理预测关键段落立场，再聚合推断全文立场。

Result: JoA-ICL在立场检测上优于现有方法，案例研究显示其在新闻推荐和媒体偏见分析中的实用性。

Conclusion: K-News-Stance和JoA-ICL为长文立场检测提供了有效工具，有助于增强新闻多样性和减少偏见。

Abstract: As online news consumption grows, personalized recommendation systems have
become integral to digital journalism. However, these systems risk reinforcing
filter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse
perspectives. Stance detection -- identifying a text's position on a target --
can help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and
data-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research
remains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address
these gaps, we introduce \textsc{K-News-Stance}, the first Korean dataset for
article-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with
article-level and 19,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal
issues. We also propose \textsc{JoA-ICL}, a \textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided
\textbf{A}gentic \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{L}earning framework that
employs a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural
segments (e.g., leads, quotes), which are then aggregated to infer the overall
article stance. Experiments show that \textsc{JoA-ICL} outperforms existing
stance detection methods, highlighting the benefits of segment-level agency in
capturing the overall position of long-form news articles. Two case studies
further demonstrate its broader utility in promoting viewpoint diversity in
news recommendations and uncovering patterns of media bias.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了LLM在临床决策支持系统中的潜力，可提升早期预警系统并将患者叙述转化为可操作的风险评估。

Abstract: Timely identification and accurate risk stratification of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) remain essential for reducing global mortality. While existing
prediction models primarily leverage structured data, unstructured clinical
notes contain valuable early indicators. This study introduces a novel
LLM-augmented clinical NLP pipeline that employs domain-adapted large language
models for symptom extraction, contextual reasoning, and correlation from
free-text reports. Our approach integrates cardiovascular-specific fine-tuning,
prompt-based inference, and entity-aware reasoning. Evaluations on MIMIC-III
and CARDIO-NLP datasets demonstrate improved performance in precision, recall,
F1-score, and AUROC, with high clinical relevance (kappa = 0.82) assessed by
cardiologists. Challenges such as contextual hallucination, which occurs when
plausible information contracts with provided source, and temporal ambiguity,
which is related with models struggling with chronological ordering of events
are addressed using prompt engineering and hybrid rule-based verification. This
work underscores the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support systems
(CDSS), advancing early warning systems and enhancing the translation of
patient narratives into actionable risk assessments.

Abstract: The July Revolution in Bangladesh marked a significant student-led mass
uprising, uniting people across the nation to demand justice, accountability,
and systemic reform. Social media platforms played a pivotal role in amplifying
public sentiment and shaping discourse during this historic mass uprising. In
this study, we present a hybrid transformer-based sentiment analysis framework
to decode public opinion expressed in social media comments during and after
the revolution. We used a brand new dataset of 4,200 Bangla comments collected
from social media. The framework employs advanced transformer-based feature
extraction techniques, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and the
proposed hybrid XMB-BERT, to capture nuanced patterns in textual data.
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) were utilized for dimensionality reduction
to enhance computational efficiency. We explored eleven traditional and
advanced machine learning classifiers for identifying sentiments. The proposed
hybrid XMB-BERT with the voting classifier achieved an exceptional accuracy of
83.7% and outperform other model classifier combinations. This study
underscores the potential of machine learning techniques to analyze social
sentiment in low-resource languages like Bangla.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在跨境金融活动中使用大型语言模型（LLMs）改进实体匹配的准确性和效率，相比传统方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨境金融活动的增加需要更准确的实体识别和分类，传统方法因语言和语义问题表现不佳。

Method: 比较了传统算法（如Jaccard、余弦、Levenshtein距离）、Hugging Face的LLMs和接口型LLMs（如Microsoft Copilot、Qwen 2.5），并使用65个葡萄牙公司案例进行测试。

Result: 传统方法准确率超92%，但假阳性率高（20-40%）；接口型LLMs准确率超93%，F1分数超96%，假阳性率更低（40-80%）。

Conclusion: LLMs在实体匹配中优于传统方法，尤其在处理语言和语义复杂性方面表现突出。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of cross-border financial activities in global markets
has underscored the necessity of accurately identifying and classifying foreign
entities. This practice is essential within the Spanish financial system for
ensuring robust risk management, regulatory adherence, and the prevention of
financial misconduct. This process involves a labor-intensive entity-matching
task, where entities need to be validated against available reference sources.
Challenges arise from linguistic variations, special characters, outdated
names, and changes in legal forms, complicating traditional matching algorithms
like Jaccard, cosine, and Levenshtein distances. These methods struggle with
contextual nuances and semantic relationships, leading to mismatches. To
address these limitations, we explore Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
flexible alternative. LLMs leverage extensive training to interpret context,
handle abbreviations, and adapt to legal transitions. We evaluate traditional
methods, Hugging Face-based LLMs, and interface-based LLMs (e.g., Microsoft
Copilot, Alibaba's Qwen 2.5) using a dataset of 65 Portuguese company cases.
Results show traditional methods achieve accuracies over 92% but suffer high
false positive rates (20-40%). Interface-based LLMs outperform, achieving
accuracies above 93%, F1 scores exceeding 96%, and lower false positives
(40-80%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐机制无法保护dLLMs免受上下文感知的掩码输入对抗提示攻击，暴露了新的安全威胁。

Method: 提出DIJA框架，利用双向建模和并行解码的弱点，构造对抗性掩码文本提示。

Result: DIJA在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，最高达到100%关键词攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究强调需重新思考dLLMs的安全对齐机制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and
greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling.
However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we
identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to
safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts,
exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first
systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety
weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial
interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of
dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional
modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked
spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic
filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard
alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned
dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed
in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA
significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously
overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves
up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior
baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and
by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of
harmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent
need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.

Method: 提出一个框架研究LLMs中的中毒问题，展示多触发器共存现象，并通过分层权重差异分析设计后处理恢复方法。

Result: 发现多触发器可以共存且激活稳健，即使输入被替换或分隔；提出的恢复方法能高效移除触发器行为。

Conclusion: LLMs存在广泛且持续的中毒漏洞，提出的后处理方法为多触发器中毒提供了实用防御方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to
data poisoning attacks, where malicious training examples embed hidden
behaviours triggered by specific input patterns. However, most existing works
assume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited
understanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within
the model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in
LLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a
single model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed
several triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding
similarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation
even when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings
expose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate
this threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains
specific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our
method effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter
updates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger
poisoning.

Abstract: We present a robust ensemble-based system for multilingual multimodal

integrates Gemini 2.5 Flash for visual description, Gemini 1.5 Pro for caption
refinement and consistency checks, and Gemini 2.5 Pro as a reasoner which
handles final answer selection, all coordinated through carefully engineered
few-shot and zero-shot prompts. We conducted an extensive ablation study,
training several large language models (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Phi 4, Gemma 3,
Mistral) on an English dataset and its multilingual augmented version.
Additionally, we evaluated Gemini 2.5 Flash in a zero-shot setting for
comparison and found it to substantially outperform the trained models. Prompt
design also proved critical: enforcing concise, language-normalized formats and
prohibiting explanatory text boosted model accuracy on the English validation
set from 55.9% to 61.7%. On the official leaderboard, our system (Team MSA)
achieved first place overall in the multilingual track with 81.4% accuracy, and
led 11 out of 13 individual language tracks, with top results such as 95.07%
for Croatian and 92.12% for Italian. These findings highlight that lightweight

Motivation: 解决LLMs记忆和泄露个人信息的问题，特别是如何识别模型存储的个体-事实关联，以符合GDPR的RTBF规定。

Method: 引入WikiMem数据集（5000+自然语言提示）和模型无关的指标，通过校准负对数似然对真实值和反事实值进行排序。

Result: 评估了15个LLMs（410M-70B参数），发现记忆与个体网络存在和模型规模相关。

Conclusion: 为识别LLMs中个人数据记忆提供基础，支持动态构建遗忘集以满足RTBF请求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can memorize and reveal personal information,
raising concerns regarding compliance with the EU's GDPR, particularly the
Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF). Existing machine unlearning methods assume the
data to forget is already known but do not address how to identify which
individual-fact associations are stored in the model. Privacy auditing
techniques typically operate at the population level or target a small set of
identifiers, limiting applicability to individual-level data inquiries. We
introduce WikiMem, a dataset of over 5,000 natural language canaries covering
243 human-related properties from Wikidata, and a model-agnostic metric to
quantify human-fact associations in LLMs. Our approach ranks ground-truth
values against counterfactuals using calibrated negative log-likelihood across
paraphrased prompts. We evaluate 200 individuals across 15 LLMs (410M-70B
parameters), showing that memorization correlates with subject web presence and
model scale. We provide a foundation for identifying memorized personal data in
LLMs at the individual level, enabling the dynamic construction of forget sets
for machine unlearning and RTBF requests.

Method: 通过实验研究，使用六种开源LLM和18种配置，分析77,000多个编码决策，评估温度和代理角色对共识和编码准确性的影响。

Result: 温度显著影响共识达成，多角色代理延迟共识，但未显著提升编码准确性。仅特定模型和条件下MAS表现优于单代理。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM定性方法的局限性，挑战了多样MAS角色能提升结果的假设，并开源了实验代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable new possibilities for qualitative
research at scale, including coding and data annotation. While multi-agent
systems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over
single-agent coding remain poorly understood. We conducted an experimental
study of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding
accuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source
MAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and
consensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion
parameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding
decisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from
online math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and
when consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas
(including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus
in four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs,
higher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas
on consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust
improvements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS
consensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code
category showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was
0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive
persona. Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations
suggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications
that could improve codebooks and human-AI coding. We contribute new insight
into the limits of LLM-based qualitative methods, challenging the notion that
diverse MAS personas lead to better outcomes. We open-source our MAS and
experimentation code.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注英语和美国社会背景下的偏见评估，缺乏其他语言和社会背景的资源，因此需要开发适用于西班牙和加泰罗尼亚语的评估工具。

Method: 基于原始BBQ数据集，设计了西班牙语和加泰罗尼亚语的平行数据集，采用多选题QA形式评估10类社会偏见。

Result: 评估结果显示，模型在模糊场景中难以选择正确答案，且高QA准确率常与依赖社会偏见相关。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发多语言和社会背景偏见评估工具的重要性，并揭示了LLMs在非英语环境中的偏见问题。

Abstract: Previous literature has largely shown that Large Language Models (LLMs)
perpetuate social biases learnt from their pre-training data. Given the notable
lack of resources for social bias evaluation in languages other than English,
and for social contexts outside of the United States, this paper introduces the
Spanish and the Catalan Bias Benchmarks for Question Answering (EsBBQ and
CaBBQ). Based on the original BBQ, these two parallel datasets are designed to
assess social bias across 10 categories using a multiple-choice QA setting, now
adapted to the Spanish and Catalan languages and to the social context of
Spain. We report evaluation results on different LLMs, factoring in model
family, size and variant. Our results show that models tend to fail to choose
the correct answer in ambiguous scenarios, and that high QA accuracy often
correlates with greater reliance on social biases.

Conclusion: 基于代理的LLM系统在协议分析和FSM推断方面具有潜力，适用于网络安全和逆向工程。

Abstract: Finite-State Machines (FSMs) are critical for modeling the operational logic
of network protocols, enabling verification, analysis, and vulnerability
discovery. However, existing FSM extraction techniques face limitations such as
scalability, incomplete coverage, and ambiguity in natural language
specifications. In this paper, we propose FlowFSM, a novel agentic framework
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with prompt chaining and
chain-of-thought reasoning to extract accurate FSMs from raw RFC documents.
FlowFSM systematically processes protocol specifications, identifies state
transitions, and constructs structured rule-books by chaining agent outputs.
Experimental evaluation across FTP and RTSP protocols demonstrates that FlowFSM
achieves high extraction precision while minimizing hallucinated transitions,
showing promising results. Our findings highlight the potential of agent-based
LLM systems in the advancement of protocol analysis and FSM inference for
cybersecurity and reverse engineering applications.

Result: 发现语言特定特征主要出现在模型的中间到最终层，且具有可解释性，可用于语言识别，性能与fastText相当。

Conclusion: SAE-LAPE方法有效识别了语言特定特征，为理解LLM的多语言机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding the multilingual mechanisms of large language models (LLMs)
provides insight into how they process different languages, yet this remains
challenging. Existing studies often focus on individual neurons, but their
polysemantic nature makes it difficult to isolate language-specific units from
cross-lingual representations. To address this, we explore sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) for their ability to learn monosemantic features that represent concrete
and abstract concepts across languages in LLMs. While some of these features
are language-independent, the presence of language-specific features remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce SAE-LAPE, a method based on feature
activation probability, to identify language-specific features within the
feed-forward network. We find that many such features predominantly appear in
the middle to final layers of the model and are interpretable. These features
influence the model's multilingual performance and language output and can be
used for language identification with performance comparable to fastText along
with more interpretability. Our code is available at

TL;DR: KV-Latent通过降采样Key-Value向量维度到潜在空间，显著减少KV Cache占用并提升推理速度，仅需少量额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer Decoder在推理过程中KV Cache逐渐增加导致的内存和带宽效率瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出KV-Latent范式，降采样KV向量维度至潜在空间，改进Rotary Positional Embedding的频率采样机制以增强稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，KV-Latent能显著减少KV Cache占用并提升推理速度，且对模型性能影响较小。

Conclusion: KV-Latent为构建高效语言模型系统提供了新思路，并展示了KV Cache优化的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformer Decoders have become the
preferred choice for conversational generative AI. Despite the overall
superiority of the Decoder architecture, the gradually increasing Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference has emerged as a primary efficiency bottleneck,
both in aspects of memory consumption and data transfer bandwidth limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose a paradigm called KV-Latent. By
down-sampling the Key-Value vector dimensions into a latent space, we can
significantly reduce the KV Cache footprint and improve inference speed, only
with a small amount of extra training, less than 1\% of pre-training takes.
Besides, we enhanced the stability of Rotary Positional Embedding applied on
lower-dimensional vectors by modifying its frequency sampling mechanism,
avoiding noise introduced by higher frequencies while retaining position
attenuation. Our experiments, including both models with Grouped Query
Attention and those without, have yielded satisfactory results. Finally, we
conducted comparative experiments to study the impact of separately reducing
Key and Value components on model's performance. Our approach allows for the
construction of more efficient language model systems, and opens the new
possibility on KV Cache saving and efficient LLMs. Our code is available at

Abstract: Efficient and accurate autoformalization methods, which leverage large-scale
datasets of extensive natural language mathematical problems to construct
formal language datasets, are key to advancing formal mathematical reasoning.
In this paper, we propose an autoformalization pipeline based on large language
models with error feedback, achieving a fully automatic and training-free
formalization approach. Using this pipeline, we curate an Olympiad-level
dataset aligning natural language problems with Lean formalizations. The
dataset comprises $3,922$ mathematical problems in natural language and $9,787$
in Lean, of which $64.46\%$ were assessed as at least above-average quality,
making it suitable as a benchmark for automated theorem provers. Additionally,
we investigate the formalization and reasoning capabilities of various LLMs and
empirically demonstrate that few-shot learning, error feedback, and increasing
sampling numbers enhance the autoformalization process. Experiments of three
automated theorem provers on the \dataset\ dataset also highlight its
challenging nature and its value as a benchmark for formal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 本文填补了中文仇恨言论检测研究的空白，为模型的可解释性和性能提升提供了重要支持。

Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech has inflicted significant societal harm,
with its intensity and directionality closely tied to specific targets and
arguments. In recent years, numerous machine learning-based methods have been
developed to detect hateful comments on online platforms automatically.
However, research on Chinese hate speech detection lags behind, and
interpretability studies face two major challenges: first, the scarcity of
span-level fine-grained annotated datasets limits models' deep semantic
understanding of hate speech; second, insufficient research on identifying and
interpreting coded hate speech restricts model explainability in complex
real-world scenarios. To address these, we make the following contributions:
(1) We introduce the Span-level Target-Aware Toxicity Extraction dataset (STATE
ToxiCN), the first span-level Chinese hate speech dataset, and evaluate the
hate semantic understanding of existing models using it. (2) We conduct the
first comprehensive study on Chinese coded hate terms, LLMs' ability to
interpret hate semantics. (3) We propose a method to integrate an annotated
lexicon into models, significantly enhancing hate speech detection performance.
Our work provides valuable resources and insights to advance the
interpretability of Chinese hate speech detection research.

Conclusion: Dr.Copilot是罗马尼亚医疗环境中首批实际部署的LLM系统之一，效果显著。

Abstract: Text-based telemedicine has become increasingly common, yet the quality of
medical advice in doctor-patient interactions is often judged more on how
advice is communicated rather than its clinical accuracy. To address this, we
introduce Dr.Copilot , a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system that

quality of their written responses. Rather than assessing medical correctness,
Dr.Copilot provides feedback along 17 interpretable axes. The system comprises
of three LLM agents with prompts automatically optimized via DSPy. Designed
with low-resource Romanian data and deployed using open-weight models, it
delivers real-time specific feedback to doctors within a telemedicine platform.
Empirical evaluations and live deployment with 41 doctors show measurable
improvements in user reviews and response quality, marking one of the first
real-world deployments of LLMs in Romanian medical settings.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values has attracted
increasing attention since it provides clarity, transparency, and the ability
to adapt to evolving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a Controlled Value
Vector Activation (ConVA) method that directly aligns the internal values of
LLMs by interpreting how a value is encoded in their latent representations and
modifies relevant activations to ensure consistent values in LLMs. To ensure an
accurate and unbiased interpretation, we propose a context-controlled value
vector identification method. To consistently control values without
sacrificing model performance, we introduce a gated value vector activation
method for effective and minimum degree of value control. Experiments show that
our method achieves the highest control success rate across 10 basic values
without hurting LLM performance and fluency, and ensures target values even
with opposite and potentially malicious input prompts. Source code and data are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合人类专家和大型语言模型（LLM）的方法，用于评估学术论文的方法新颖性，通过提取同行评审报告中的新颖性句子和LLM总结的方法部分，微调预训练语言模型（PLM），并设计了文本引导的融合模块，实验证明其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新颖性评估方法（专家判断或引用组合）存在局限性，如专家知识有限、引用组合效果不确定。结合LLM的知识和人类专家的判断能力，可以弥补这些不足。

Method: 从同行评审报告中提取新颖性句子，利用LLM总结论文方法部分，用于微调PLM；设计文本引导的融合模块（Sparse-Attention）整合人类和LLM知识。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在评估方法新颖性方面优于大量基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合人类和LLM知识的方法能有效评估论文新颖性，为同行评审提供了新工具。

Abstract: Novelty is a crucial criterion in the peer review process for evaluating
academic papers. Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique
reference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited
knowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain.
Moreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large
language model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts
possess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our
research integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to
address the limitations of novelty assessment. The most common novelty in
academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose
leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs,
e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we
extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review
reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper,
which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a
text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human
and LLM knowledge. We compared the method we proposed with a large number of
baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次对大型语言模型（LLMs）在流程建模（PMo）任务中使用的多种流程模型表示（PMRs）进行了系统比较，并评估了它们在流程模型生成（PMG）中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PMRs在结构、复杂性和可用性上差异较大，且缺乏系统比较，导致PMG任务的评估和比较困难。

Method: 研究引入了包含55个流程描述和九种不同PMRs模型的PMo数据集，并从两个维度评估PMRs：LLM-based PMo的适用性和PMG性能。

Result: Mermaid在六个PMo标准中得分最高，而BPMN text在流程元素相似性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为PMRs的选择提供了实证依据，Mermaid和BPMN text分别在不同场景下表现最优。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied for Process Modeling
(PMo) tasks such as Process Model Generation (PMG). To support these tasks,
researchers have introduced a variety of Process Model Representations (PMRs)
that serve as model abstractions or generation targets. However, these PMRs
differ widely in structure, complexity, and usability, and have never been
systematically compared. Moreover, recent PMG approaches rely on distinct
evaluation strategies and generation techniques, making comparison difficult.
This paper presents the first empirical study that evaluates multiple PMRs in
the context of PMo with LLMs. We introduce the PMo Dataset, a new dataset
containing 55 process descriptions paired with models in nine different PMRs.
We evaluate PMRs along two dimensions: suitability for LLM-based PMo and
performance on PMG. \textit{Mermaid} achieves the highest overall score across
six PMo criteria, whereas \textit{BPMN text} delivers the best PMG results in
terms of process element similarity.

Motivation: 解决多标签情感检测中的数据不平衡问题，避免传统重采样方法的计算负担。

Method: 使用动态调整类别权重的加权损失函数，评估BERT、RoBERTa和BART模型在BRIGHTER数据集上的表现。

Result: 加权损失函数提高了高频情感类别的性能，但对少数类别的改善有限。

Conclusion: 该方法在多标签情感检测中有效，但仍面临处理少数类别的挑战。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of a simple weighted loss function to
Transformer-based models for multi-label emotion detection in SemEval-2025
Shared Task 11. Our approach addresses data imbalance by dynamically adjusting
class weights, thereby enhancing performance on minority emotion classes
without the computational burden of traditional resampling methods. We evaluate
BERT, RoBERTa, and BART on the BRIGHTER dataset, using evaluation metrics such
as Micro F1, Macro F1, ROC-AUC, Accuracy, and Jaccard similarity coefficients.
The results demonstrate that the weighted loss function improves performance on
high-frequency emotion classes but shows limited impact on minority classes.
These findings underscore both the effectiveness and the challenges of applying
this approach to imbalanced multi-label emotion detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级、可解释的数据污染风险（DCR）框架，用于检测和量化大语言模型（LLM）在评估数据中的污染问题，并通过调整准确性指标提供更真实的性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的快速发展引发了对评估数据污染的担忧，污染可能导致性能指标虚高，影响对模型真实泛化能力的评估。

Method: DCR框架通过四个粒度级别（语义、信息、数据和标签）检测污染，并利用模糊推理系统合成污染分数，生成统一的DCR因子来调整原始准确性。

Result: 在9个LLM（0.5B-72B）上的验证表明，DCR框架能可靠诊断污染严重程度，调整后的准确性误差在三个基准测试中平均低于4%。

Conclusion: DCR框架计算高效且透明，为常规评估提供了实用的污染检测工具，有助于更公平的比较和提升LLM基准测试的可信度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about benchmark data contamination (BDC), where models inadvertently memorize
evaluation data, inflating performance metrics and undermining genuine
generalization assessment. This paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk
(DCR) framework, a lightweight, interpretable pipeline designed to detect and
quantify BDC across four granular levels: semantic, informational, data, and
label. By synthesizing contamination scores via a fuzzy inference system, DCR
produces a unified DCR Factor that adjusts raw accuracy to reflect
contamination-aware performance. Validated on 9 LLMs (0.5B-72B) across
sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, the
DCR framework reliably diagnoses contamination severity and with accuracy
adjusted using the DCR Factor to within 4% average error across the three
benchmarks compared to the uncontaminated baseline. Emphasizing computational
efficiency and transparency, DCR provides a practical tool for integrating
contamination assessment into routine evaluations, fostering fairer comparisons
and enhancing the credibility of LLM benchmarking practices.

Conclusion: KisMATH为研究CoT在语言模型推理中的作用提供了新工具和方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought traces have been shown to improve performance of large
language models in a plethora of reasoning tasks, yet there is no consensus on
the mechanism through which this performance boost is achieved. To shed more
light on this, we introduce Causal CoT Graphs (CCGs), which are directed
acyclic graphs automatically extracted from reasoning traces that model
fine-grained causal dependencies in the language model output. A collection of
$1671$ mathematical reasoning problems from MATH500, GSM8K and AIME, and their
associated CCGs are compiled into our dataset -- \textbf{KisMATH}. Our detailed
empirical analysis with 15 open-weight LLMs shows that (i) reasoning nodes in
the CCG are mediators for the final answer, a condition necessary for
reasoning; and (ii) LLMs emphasise reasoning paths given by the CCG, indicating
that models internally realise structures akin to our graphs. KisMATH enables
controlled, graph-aligned interventions and opens up avenues for further
investigation into the role of chain-of-thought in LLM reasoning.

Method: 使用相同的训练方法（SOTA Ettin模型套件）训练编码器和解码器模型，范围从1700万到10亿参数，并在分类、检索和生成任务中比较性能。

Result: 编码器模型在分类和检索任务中表现更好，而解码器模型在生成任务中更优。直接转换模型目标效果不如专用模型。

Conclusion: 结论是专用模型在各自任务中表现最佳，开源数据为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) community focuses almost exclusively on
decoder-only language models, since they are easier to use for text generation.
However, a large subset of the community still uses encoder-only models for
tasks such as classification or retrieval. Previous work has attempted to
compare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that
have different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We
introduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and
decoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on
up to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and
decoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their
respective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as
decoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at
classification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks.
However, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice
versa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse
objective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa
for generative tasks). We open-source all artifacts of this study including
training data, training order segmented by checkpoint, and 200+ checkpoints to
allow future work to analyze or extend all aspects of training.

Conclusion: 提示可以引导LLMs选择最优推理策略，为提升其推理能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: Human reasoning involves different strategies, each suited to specific
problems. Prior work shows that large language model (LLMs) tend to favor a
single reasoning strategy, potentially limiting their effectiveness in diverse
reasoning challenges. In this work, we investigate whether prompting can
control LLMs reasoning strategies and assess its impact on logical
problem-solving. While our experiments show that no single strategy
consistently improves accuracy, performance could be enhanced if models could
adaptively choose the optimal strategy. We propose methods to guide LLMs in
strategy selection, highlighting new ways to refine their reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 旨在为香港建立符合本地价值观的AI基础设施，适应其多语言、特殊法律框架和文化背景。

Method: 基于DeepSeek架构，通过全参数微调和检索增强生成（RAG）系统实现模型对齐和实时信息获取。

Conclusion: 论文提供了开发区域性AI系统的技术方案和可复制的蓝图，强调数字主权和本地化AI治理。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of HKGAI-V1, a foundational sovereign
large language model (LLM), developed as part of an initiative to establish
value-aligned AI infrastructure specifically tailored for Hong Kong. Addressing
the region's unique multilingual environment (Cantonese, Mandarin, and
English), its distinct socio-legal context under the "one country, two systems"
framework, and specific local cultural and value considerations, the model is
built upon the DeepSeek architecture and systematically aligned with regional
norms through a multifaceted full parameter fine-tuning process. It is further
integrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to ensure timely
and factually grounded information access. The core contribution lies in the
design and implementation of a comprehensive, region-specific AI alignment and
safety framework, demonstrated through two key achievements: 1) The successful
development of HKGAI-V1 itself - which outper-forms general-purpose models in
handling Hong Kong-specific culturally sensitive queries, and embodies a
"governance-embedded" approach to digital sovereignty - empowers Hong Kong to
exercise control over AI applications in critical sectors including public
services, legal systems, and edu-cation. 2) The development of the proprietary
Adversarial HK Value Benchmark, a rigorous tool for evaluating model alignment
with local ethical and legal stand-ards under challenging conditions. By
documenting these achievements, the paper provides not only a technological
artifact but also a replicable blueprint for developing advanced, regionally
focused AI systems deeply rooted in their local identities.

Method: 通过人工评估活动（分类错误评估和跨度级标注），比较传统指标、可训练方法和LLM作为评估者的方法。

Result: 简单指标（如词重叠）与人类判断相关性高，LLM评估不可靠，错误信息风险最大。

Conclusion: 简单指标在忠实性评估中表现优异，LLM评估需谨慎，错误信息是主要风险。

Abstract: We examine evaluation of faithfulness to input data in the context of hotel
highlights: brief LLM-generated summaries that capture unique features of
accommodations. Through human evaluation campaigns involving categorical error
assessment and span-level annotation, we compare traditional metrics, trainable
methods, and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings reveal that simpler
metrics like word overlap correlate surprisingly well with human judgments
(Spearman correlation rank of 0.63), often outperforming more complex methods
when applied to out-of-domain data. We further demonstrate that while LLMs can
generate high-quality highlights, they prove unreliable for evaluation as they
tend to severely under- or over-annotate. Our analysis of real-world business
impacts shows incorrect and non-checkable information pose the greatest risks.
We also highlight challenges in crowdsourced evaluations.

Abstract: Learning from demonstration provides a sample-efficient approach to acquiring
complex behaviors, enabling robots to move robustly, compliantly, and with
fluidity. In this context, Dynamic Motion Primitives offer built - in stability
and robustness to disturbances but often struggle to capture complex periodic
behaviors. Moreover, they are limited in their ability to interpolate between
different tasks. These shortcomings substantially narrow their applicability,
excluding a wide class of practically meaningful tasks such as locomotion and
rhythmic tool use. In this work, we introduce Orbitally Stable Motion
Primitives (OSMPs) - a framework that combines a learned diffeomorphic encoder
with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in latent space, enabling the accurate
acquisition of periodic motions from demonstrations while ensuring formal
guarantees of orbital stability and transverse contraction. Furthermore, by
conditioning the bijective encoder on the task, we enable a single learned
policy to represent multiple motion objectives, yielding consistent zero-shot
generalization to unseen motion objectives within the training distribution. We
validate the proposed approach through extensive simulation and real-world
experiments across a diverse range of robotic platforms - from collaborative
arms and soft manipulators to a bio-inspired rigid-soft turtle robot -
demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines such as diffusion policies, among others.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models represent a transformative shift in
robotics, with the aim of unifying visual perception, natural language
understanding, and embodied control within a single learning framework. This
review presents a comprehensive and forward-looking synthesis of the VLA
paradigm, with a particular emphasis on robotic manipulation and
instruction-driven autonomy. We comprehensively analyze 102 VLA models, 26
foundational datasets, and 12 simulation platforms that collectively shape the
development and evaluation of VLAs models. These models are categorized into
key architectural paradigms, each reflecting distinct strategies for
integrating vision, language, and control in robotic systems. Foundational
datasets are evaluated using a novel criterion based on task complexity,
variety of modalities, and dataset scale, allowing a comparative analysis of
their suitability for generalist policy learning. We introduce a
two-dimensional characterization framework that organizes these datasets based
on semantic richness and multimodal alignment, showing underexplored regions in
the current data landscape. Simulation environments are evaluated for their
effectiveness in generating large-scale data, as well as their ability to
facilitate transfer from simulation to real-world settings and the variety of
supported tasks. Using both academic and industrial contributions, we recognize
ongoing challenges and outline strategic directions such as scalable
pretraining protocols, modular architectural design, and robust multimodal
alignment strategies. This review serves as both a technical reference and a
conceptual roadmap for advancing embodiment and robotic control, providing
insights that span from dataset generation to real world deployment of
generalist robotic agents.

Abstract: Passive deformation due to compliance is a commonly used benefit of soft
robots, providing opportunities to achieve robust actuation with few active
degrees of freedom. Soft growing robots in particular have shown promise in
navigation of unstructured environments due to their passive deformation. If
their collisions and subsequent deformations can be better understood, soft
robots could be used to understand the structure of the environment from direct
tactile measurements. In this work, we propose the use of soft growing robots
as mapping and exploration tools. We do this by first characterizing collision
behavior during discrete turns, then leveraging this model to develop a
geometry-based simulator that models robot trajectories in 2D environments.
Finally, we demonstrate the model and simulator validity by mapping unknown
environments using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the optimal next deployment
given current knowledge. Over both uniform and non-uniform environments, this
selection method rapidly approaches ideal actions, showing the potential for
soft growing robots in unstructured environment exploration and mapping.

Result: 实验显示，使用生成场景训练的自动驾驶系统下游成功率平均提升9.2%，且生成的对抗行为更真实。

Conclusion: RCG框架能生成更真实的高风险场景，有效提升自动驾驶系统的压力测试效果。

Abstract: Safety-critical scenarios are essential for training and evaluating
autonomous driving (AD) systems, yet remain extremely rare in real-world
driving datasets. To address this, we propose Real-world Crash Grounding (RCG),
a scenario generation framework that integrates crash-informed semantics into
adversarial perturbation pipelines. We construct a safety-aware behavior
representation through contrastive pre-training on large-scale driving logs,
followed by fine-tuning on a small, crash-rich dataset with approximate
trajectory annotations extracted from video. This embedding captures semantic
structure aligned with real-world accident behaviors and supports selection of
adversary trajectories that are both high-risk and behaviorally realistic. We
incorporate the resulting selection mechanism into two prior scenario
generation pipelines, replacing their handcrafted scoring objectives with an
embedding-based criterion. Experimental results show that ego agents trained
against these generated scenarios achieve consistently higher downstream
success rates, with an average improvement of 9.2% across seven evaluation
settings. Qualitative and quantitative analyses further demonstrate that our
approach produces more plausible and nuanced adversary behaviors, enabling more
effective and realistic stress testing of AD systems. Code and tools will be
released publicly.

Motivation: 现有未见物体实例分割（UOIS）方法依赖大规模数据集训练，容易过拟合静态视觉特征，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 基于视觉交互性原理，设计实时交互感知框架rt-RISeg，利用机器人交互产生的体帧不变特征（BFIF）动态分割物体。

Result: rt-RISeg的平均分割准确率比现有UOIS方法高27.5%，且生成的分割掩码可作为视觉基础模型的提示进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: rt-RISeg通过交互感知和动态特征分析，显著提升了未见物体分割的泛化能力和实时性。

Abstract: Successful execution of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks in new
environments, such as grasping, depends on the ability to proficiently segment
unseen objects from the background and other objects. Previous works in unseen
object instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which
often leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results
in poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution
scenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the
principle that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We
propose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that
continuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a
designed body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative
rotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting
from selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any
learned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline
generates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot
interaction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the
effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an
average object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art
UOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show
that the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to
vision foundation models for significantly improved performance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合预训练模型和目标条件强化学习，显著提升了机器人抓取的通用性和效率。

Abstract: General-purpose robotic manipulation, including reach and grasp, is essential
for deployment into households and workspaces involving diverse and evolving
tasks. Recent advances propose using large pre-trained models, such as Large
Language Models and object detectors, to boost robotic perception in
reinforcement learning. These models, trained on large datasets via
self-supervised learning, can process text prompts and identify diverse objects
in scenes, an invaluable skill in RL where learning object interaction is
resource-intensive. This study demonstrates how to integrate such models into
Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning to enable general and versatile robotic
reach and grasp capabilities. We use a pre-trained object detection model to
enable the agent to identify the object from a text prompt and generate a mask
for goal conditioning. Mask-based goal conditioning provides object-agnostic
cues, improving feature sharing and generalization. The effectiveness of the
proposed framework is demonstrated in a simulated reach-and-grasp task, where
the mask-based goal conditioning consistently maintains a $\sim$90\% success
rate in grasping both in and out-of-distribution objects, while also ensuring
faster convergence to higher returns.

Motivation: 凸集图（GCS）为混合离散-连续规划问题提供了一种统一的建模语言，但现有方法通常需要专门解决方案。研究旨在提出一种通用且高效的方法来解决GCS中的最短路径问题。

Method: 通过半定规划合成成本函数的二次下界，并利用该下界指导增量搜索算法，近似求解最短路径。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在碰撞自由运动规划、技能链和混合系统最优控制等问题中表现高效。

Conclusion: GCS中的SWP为混合离散-连续规划问题提供了统一的解决方案，兼具高性能和计算效率。

Abstract: We study the Shortest-Walk Problem (SWP) in a Graph of Convex Sets (GCS). A
GCS is a graph where each vertex is paired with a convex program, and each edge
couples adjacent programs via additional costs and constraints. A walk in a GCS
is a sequence of vertices connected by edges, where vertices may be repeated.
The length of a walk is given by the cumulative optimal value of the
corresponding convex programs. To solve the SWP in GCS, we first synthesize a
piecewise-quadratic lower bound on the problem's cost-to-go function using
semidefinite programming. Then we use this lower bound to guide an
incremental-search algorithm that yields an approximate shortest walk. We show
that the SWP in GCS is a natural language for many mixed discrete-continuous
planning problems in robotics, unifying problems that typically require
specialized solutions while delivering high performance and computational
efficiency. We demonstrate this through experiments in collision-free motion
planning, skill chaining, and optimal control of hybrid systems.

<details>

Motivation: 当前移动机械臂框架通常将导航和操作解耦，导致导航不精确时性能下降，尤其是在角度不对齐的情况下。需要一种方法使机械臂能从不同方向执行相同任务。

Method: 采用基于SAM2的对象中心方法，将操作方向信息融入模型，实现任务在不同方向下的一致性理解。

Result: 在自定义移动机械臂上部署模型，并在不同角度下进行拾取放置任务评估，相比Action Chunking Transformer，模型在多样化角度训练下表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模仿学习在移动机械臂任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Imitation learning for mobile manipulation is a key challenge in the field of
robotic manipulation. However, current mobile manipulation frameworks typically
decouple navigation and manipulation, executing manipulation only after
reaching a certain location. This can lead to performance degradation when
navigation is imprecise, especially due to misalignment in approach angles. To
enable a mobile manipulator to perform the same task from diverse orientations,
an essential capability for building general-purpose robotic models, we propose
an object-centric method based on SAM2, a foundation model towards solving
promptable visual segmentation in images, which incorporates manipulation
orientation information into our model. Our approach enables consistent
understanding of the same task from different orientations. We deploy the model
on a custom-built mobile manipulator and evaluate it on a pick-and-place task
under varied orientation angles. Compared to Action Chunking Transformer, our
model maintains superior generalization when trained with demonstrations from
varied approach angles. This work significantly enhances the generalization and
robustness of imitation learning-based mobile manipulation systems.

Conclusion: M-GAPS展示了在线策略优化在硬件上的实用性，比经典自适应控制更灵活，比无模型强化学习更稳定和数据高效。

Abstract: We study online algorithms to tune the parameters of a robot controller in a
setting where the dynamics, policy class, and optimality objective are all
time-varying. The system follows a single trajectory without episodes or state
resets, and the time-varying information is not known in advance. Focusing on
nonlinear geometric quadrotor controllers as a test case, we propose a
practical implementation of a single-trajectory model-based online policy
optimization algorithm, M-GAPS,along with reparameterizations of the quadrotor
state space and policy class to improve the optimization landscape. In hardware
experiments,we compare to model-based and model-free baselines that impose
artificial episodes. We show that M-GAPS finds near-optimal parameters more
quickly, especially when the episode length is not favorable. We also show that
M-GAPS rapidly adapts to heavy unmodeled wind and payload disturbances, and
achieves similar strong improvement on a 1:6-scale Ackermann-steered car. Our
results demonstrate the hardware practicality of this emerging class of online
policy optimization that offers significantly more flexibility than classic
adaptive control, while being more stable and data-efficient than model-free
reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: SMART-Merge规划器能够高效处理复杂的强制并道任务，为自动驾驶提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Merging onto a highway is a complex driving task that requires identifying a
safe gap, adjusting speed, often interactions to create a merging gap, and
completing the merge maneuver within a limited time window while maintaining
safety and driving comfort. In this paper, we introduce a Safe Merging and
Real-Time Merge (SMART-Merge) planner, a lattice-based motion planner designed
to facilitate safe and comfortable forced merging. By deliberately adapting
cost terms to the unique challenges of forced merging and introducing a desired
speed heuristic, SMART-Merge planner enables the ego vehicle to merge
successfully while minimizing the merge time. We verify the efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed merge planner through high-fidelity CarMaker
simulations on hundreds of highway merge scenarios. Our proposed planner
achieves the success rate of 100% as well as completes the merge maneuver in
the shortest amount of time compared with the baselines, demonstrating our
planner's capability to handle complex forced merge tasks and provide a
reliable and robust solution for autonomous highway merge. The simulation

Conclusion: 仿真验证了框架有效性，闭式解和梯度方法适用于不同设计场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified modeling and optimization framework to enhance
the kinematic performance of multi-magnet embedded soft continuum robots
(MeSCRs). To this end, we establish a differentiable system formulation based
on an extended pseudo-rigid-body model. This formulation enables analysis of
the equilibrium well-posedness and the geometry of the induced configuration
under magnetic actuation. In particular, we show that the maximum controllable
degrees of freedom of a MeSCR equal twice the number of embedded magnets. We
subsequently develop a structural optimization framework based on differential
geometry that links classical kinematic measures (e.g., manipulability and
dexterity) to the configuration of embedded magnets. The resulting optimization
condition reveals that improving local performance requires structurally
modulating the spectrum of the configuration space metric to counteract its
distortion. Closed-form solutions for optimal magnet configurations are derived
under representative conditions, and a gradient-based numerical method is
proposed for general design scenarios. Simulation studies validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: This letter presents a novel coarse-to-fine motion planning framework for
robotic manipulation in cluttered, unmodeled environments. The system
integrates a dual-camera perception setup with a B-spline-based model
predictive control (MPC) scheme. Initially, the planner generates feasible
global trajectories from partial and uncertain observations. As new visual data
are incrementally fused, both the environment model and motion planning are
progressively refined. A vision-based cost function promotes target-driven
exploration, while a refined kernel-perceptron collision detector enables
efficient constraint updates for real-time planning. The framework accommodates
closed-chain kinematics and supports dynamic replanning. Experiments on a
multi-arm platform validate its robustness and adaptability under uncertainties

Conclusion: 研究为开发能够参与自然且上下文感知的多方交互的社交智能机器人提供了贡献。

Abstract: Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has primarily focused on
single-user interactions, where robots do not need to consider the timing or
recipient of their responses. However, in multi-party interactions, such as at
malls and hospitals, social robots must understand the context and decide both
when and to whom they should respond. In this paper, we propose a
Transformer-based multi-task learning framework to improve the decision-making
process of social robots, particularly in multi-user environments. Considering
the characteristics of HRI, we propose two novel loss functions: one that
enforces constraints on active speakers to improve scene modeling, and another
that guides response selection towards utterances specifically directed at the
robot. Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures
real-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in respond
decisions, outperforming existing heuristic-based and single-task approaches.
Our findings contribute to the development of socially intelligent social
robots capable of engaging in natural and context-aware multi-party
interactions.

mechanism combining current observations with historical states and actions
through a novel diffusion U-Net architecture, significantly improving
long-horizon planning. (2) A sample-efficient hybrid learning architecture that
synergizes diffusion-guided exploration with RL policy optimization, where the
diffusion model generates diverse candidate actions and the RL critic selects
optimal actions, achieving higher exploration efficiency and policy stability
in dynamic underwater environments. Extensive simulation experiments validating
the method's superior robustness and flexibility, outperforms conventional
control methods in challenging marine conditions, offering enhanced

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for learning vision-based robotic policies
for contact-rich manipulation tasks that generalize spatially across task
configurations. We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the
policy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of
demonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a
high-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF)
and a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT,
G-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically
consistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB
images) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these
design choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is
SE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key
components for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance,
localized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH
tasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to
unseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and

Abstract: This paper presents a state-estimation solution for legged robots that uses a
set of low-cost, compact, and lightweight sensors to achieve low-drift pose and
velocity estimation under challenging locomotion conditions. The key idea is to
leverage multiple inertial measurement units on different links of the robot to
correct a major error source in standard proprioceptive odometry. We fuse the
inertial sensor information and joint encoder measurements in an extended
Kalman filter, then combine the velocity estimate from this filter with camera
data in a factor-graph-based sliding-window estimator to form a
visual-inertial-leg odometry method. We validate our state estimator through
comprehensive theoretical analysis and hardware experiments performed using
real-world robot data collected during a variety of challenging locomotion
tasks. Our algorithm consistently achieves minimal position deviation, even in
scenarios involving substantial ground impact, foot slippage, and sudden body
rotations. A C++ implementation, along with a large-scale dataset, is available

Abstract: Vision-based underwater robots can be useful in inspecting and exploring
confined spaces where traditional sensors and preplanned paths cannot be
followed. Sensor noise and situational change can cause significant uncertainty
in environmental representation. Thus, this paper explores how to represent
mapping inconsistency in vision-based sensing and incorporate depth estimation
confidence into the mapping framework. The scene depth and the confidence are
estimated using the RAFT-Stereo model and are integrated into a voxel-based
mapping framework, Voxblox. Improvements in the existing Voxblox weight
calculation and update mechanism are also proposed. Finally, a qualitative
analysis of the proposed method is performed in a confined pool and in a pier
in the Trondheim fjord. Experiments using an underwater robot demonstrated the
change in uncertainty in the visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从演示中学习时间约束以复现逻辑约束行为的挑战性问题。

Method: 采用两玩家零和游戏框架，结合遗传算法的时间逻辑挖掘（GA-TL-Mining）和逻辑约束强化学习（Logic-CRL）。

Conclusion: ILCL方法有效解决了时间约束学习问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of temporal-constraint learning from
demonstrations to reproduce demonstration-like logic-constrained behaviors.
Learning logic constraints is challenging due to the combinatorially large
space of possible specifications and the ill-posed nature of non-Markovian
constraints. To figure it out, we introduce a novel temporal-constraint
learning method, which we call inverse logic-constraint learning (ILCL). Our
method frames ICL as a two-player zero-sum game between 1) a genetic
algorithm-based temporal-logic mining (GA-TL-Mining) and 2) logic-constrained
reinforcement learning (Logic-CRL). GA-TL-Mining efficiently constructs syntax
trees for parameterized truncated linear temporal logic (TLTL) without
predefined templates. Subsequently, Logic-CRL finds a policy that maximizes
task rewards under the constructed TLTL constraints via a novel constraint
redistribution scheme. Our evaluations show ILCL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in learning and transferring TL constraints on four temporally
constrained tasks. We also demonstrate successful transfer to real-world
peg-in-shallow-hole tasks.

Conclusion: LE-Nav通过智能超参数调优和场景理解，显著提升了导航系统的性能和用户体验，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Service robots are increasingly deployed in diverse and dynamic environments,
where both physical layouts and social contexts change over time and across
locations. In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that
rely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting
in degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent
approaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional
planners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor
generalization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective
sim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an
interpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal
large language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to
adaptively tune planner hyperparameters. To achieve zero-shot scene
understanding, we utilize one-shot exemplars and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies. Additionally, a conditional variational autoencoder captures the
mapping between natural language instructions and navigation hyperparameters,
enabling expert-level tuning. Experiments show that LE-Nav can generate
hyperparameters achieving human-level tuning across diverse planners and
scenarios. Real-world navigation trials and a user study on a smart wheelchair
platform demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
quantitative metrics such as success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort,
while receiving higher subjective scores for perceived safety and social
acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/Cavendish518/LE-Nav.

Abstract: This study presents an advanced approach to enhance robotic manipulation in
uncertain and challenging environments, with a focus on autonomous operations
augmented by human-in-the-loop (HITL) control for lunar missions. By
integrating human decision-making with autonomous robotic functions, the
research improves task reliability and efficiency for space applications. The
key task addressed is the autonomous deployment of flexible solar panels using
an extendable ladder-like structure and a robotic manipulator with real-time
feedback for precision. The manipulator relays position and force-torque data,
enabling dynamic error detection and adaptive control during deployment. To
mitigate the effects of sinkage, variable payload, and low-lighting conditions,
efficient motion planning strategies are employed, supplemented by human
control that allows operators to intervene in ambiguous scenarios. Digital twin
simulation enhances system robustness by enabling continuous feedback,
iterative task refinement, and seamless integration with the deployment
pipeline. The system has been tested to validate its performance in simulated
lunar conditions and ensure reliability in extreme lighting, variable terrain,
changing payloads, and sensor limitations.

Conclusion: TRAN-D在透明物体3D重建中表现出色，尤其在稀疏视图和动态环境下具有显著优势。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is
challenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and
refraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse
views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian
Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key
insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling
focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate
artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,
ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.
Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the
reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and
chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.
TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it
consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based
state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean
absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,
despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\delta} < 2.5 cm
accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.

Abstract: Derivatives of equations of motion(EOM) describing the dynamics of rigid body
systems are becoming increasingly relevant for the robotics community and find
many applications in design and control of robotic systems. Controlling robots,
and multibody systems comprising elastic components in particular, not only
requires smooth trajectories but also the time derivatives of the control
forces/torques, hence of the EOM. This paper presents the time derivatives of
the EOM in closed form up to second-order as an alternative formulation to the
existing recursive algorithms for this purpose, which provides a direct insight
into the structure of the derivatives. The Lie group formulation for rigid body
systems is used giving rise to very compact and easily parameterized equations.

Abstract: Diagnostic activities, such as ultrasound scans and palpation, are relatively
low-cost. They play a crucial role in the early detection of health problems
and in assessing their progression. However, they are also error-prone
activities, which require highly skilled medical staff. The use of robotic
solutions can be key to decreasing the inherent subjectivity of the results and
reducing the waiting list. For a robot to perform palpation or ultrasound
scans, it must effectively manage physical interactions with the human body,
which greatly benefits from precise estimation of the patient's tissue
biomechanical properties. This paper assesses the accuracy and precision of a
robotic system in estimating the viscoelastic parameters of various materials,
including some tests on ex vivo tissues as a preliminary proof-of-concept
demonstration of the method's applicability to biological samples. The
measurements are compared against a ground truth derived from silicone
specimens with different viscoelastic properties, characterised using a
high-precision instrument. Experimental results show that the robotic system's
accuracy closely matches the ground truth, increasing confidence in the
potential use of robots for such clinical applications.

Conclusion: 所提策略在缺乏先验边界的情况下，通过结合GPR和鲁棒化设计，实现了拉格朗日系统的精确轨迹跟踪。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based robust feedback
linearization strategy to ensure precise trajectory tracking for an important
family of Lagrangian systems. We assume a nominal knowledge of the dynamics is
given but no a-priori bounds on the model mismatch are available. In our
approach, the key ingredient is the adoption of a regression framework based on
Gaussian Processes (GPR) to estimate the model mismatch. This estimate is added
to the outer loop of a classical feedback linearization scheme based on the
nominal knowledge available. Then, to compensate for the residual uncertainty,
we robustify the controller including an additional term whose size is designed
based on the variance provided by the GPR framework. We proved that, with high
probability, the proposed scheme is able to guarantee asymptotic tracking of a
desired trajectory. We tested numerically our strategy on a 2 degrees of
freedom planar robot.

Abstract: Physically reduced-scale vehicles are emerging to accelerate the development
of advanced automated driving functions. In this paper, we investigate the
effects of scaling on self-localization accuracy with visual and
visual-inertial algorithms using cameras and an inertial measurement unit
(IMU). For this purpose, ROS2-compatible visual and visual-inertial algorithms
are selected, and datasets are chosen as a baseline for real-sized vehicles. A
test drive is conducted to record data of reduced-scale vehicles. We compare
the selected localization algorithms, OpenVINS, VINS-Fusion, and RTAB-Map, in
terms of their pose accuracy against the ground-truth and against data from
real-sized vehicles. When comparing the implementation of the selected
localization algorithms to real-sized vehicles, OpenVINS has the lowest average
localization error. Although all selected localization algorithms have
overlapping error ranges, OpenVINS also performs best when applied to a
reduced-scale vehicle. When reduced-scale vehicles were compared to real-sized
vehicles, minor differences were found in translational vehicle motion
estimation accuracy. However, no significant differences were found when
comparing the estimation accuracy of rotational vehicle motion, allowing RSVRs
to be used as testing platforms for self-localization algorithms.

Result: 在两个医院场景中，消毒时间分别减少了30.7%和31.9%，同时保持了相同的消毒效果。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected public health, healthcare
systems, and daily life, especially amid resource shortages and limited
workers. This crisis has underscored the urgent need for automation in hospital
environments, particularly disinfection, which is crucial to controlling virus
transmission and improving the safety of healthcare personnel and patients.
Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection, known for its high efficiency, has been
widely adopted in hospital settings. However, most existing research focuses on
maximizing UV coverage while paying little attention to the impact of human
activity on virus distribution. To address this issue, we propose a mobile
robotic system for UV disinfection focusing on the virus hotspot. The system
prioritizes disinfection in high-risk areas and employs an approach for
optimized UV dosage to ensure that all surfaces receive an adequate level of UV
exposure while significantly reducing disinfection time. It not only improves
disinfection efficiency but also minimizes unnecessary exposure in low-risk
areas. In two representative hospital scenarios, our method achieves the same
disinfection effectiveness while reducing disinfection time by 30.7% and 31.9%,
respectively. The video of the experiment is available at:

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了双手机器人操作的协调能力，且通过省略视频预测提高了推理效率。

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is crucial in robotics, enabling complex tasks in
industrial automation and household services. However, it poses significant
challenges due to the high-dimensional action space and intricate coordination
requirements. While video prediction has been recently studied for
representation learning and control, leveraging its ability to capture rich
dynamic and behavioral information, its potential for enhancing bimanual
coordination remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified
diffusion-based framework for the joint optimization of video and action
prediction. Specifically, we propose a multi-frame latent prediction strategy
that encodes future states in a compressed latent space, preserving
task-relevant features. Furthermore, we introduce a unidirectional attention
mechanism where video prediction is conditioned on the action, while action
prediction remains independent of video prediction. This design allows us to
omit video prediction during inference, significantly enhancing efficiency.
Experiments on two simulated benchmarks and a real-world setting demonstrate a
significant improvement in the success rate over the strong baseline ACT using
our method, achieving a \textbf{24.9\%} increase on ALOHA, an \textbf{11.1\%}
increase on RoboTwin, and a \textbf{32.5\%} increase in real-world experiments.

Abstract: Vision is an essential part of attitude control for many flying animals, some
of which have no dedicated sense of gravity. Flying robots, on the other hand,
typically depend heavily on accelerometers and gyroscopes for attitude
stabilization. In this work, we present the first vision-only approach to
flight control for use in generic environments. We show that a quadrotor drone
equipped with a downward-facing event camera can estimate its attitude and
rotation rate from just the event stream, enabling flight control without
inertial sensors. Our approach uses a small recurrent convolutional neural
network trained through supervised learning. Real-world flight tests
demonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network
is capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight
control loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across
different environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.
While networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best
performance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative
generalization. Our work showcases vision-only flight control as a promising
candidate for enabling autonomous, insect-scale flying robots.

Abstract: The RoboCup Logistics League is a RoboCup competition in a smart factory
scenario that has focused on task planning, job scheduling, and multi-agent
coordination. The focus on production logistics allowed teams to develop highly
competitive strategies, but also meant that some recent developments in the
context of smart manufacturing are not reflected in the competition, weakening
its relevance over the years. In this paper, we describe the vision for the
RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League, a new competition designed as a larger
smart manufacturing scenario, reflecting all the major aspects of a modern
factory. It will consist of several tracks that are initially independent but
gradually combined into one smart manufacturing scenario. The new tracks will
cover industrial robotics challenges such as assembly, human-robot
collaboration, and humanoid robotics, but also retain a focus on production
logistics. We expect the reenvisioned competition to be more attractive to
newcomers and well-tried teams, while also shifting the focus to current and
future challenges of industrial robotics.

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration in surgery represents a significant area of
research, driven by the increasing capability of autonomous robotic systems to
assist surgeons in complex procedures. This systematic review examines the
advancements and persistent challenges in the development of autonomous
surgical robotic assistants (ASARs), focusing specifically on scenarios where

identified: teleoperation-based assistance and direct hands-on interaction. The
findings reveal a growing research emphasis on ASARs, with predominant
applications currently in endoscope guidance, alongside emerging progress in
autonomous tool manipulation. Several key challenges hinder wider adoption,
including the alignment of robotic actions with human surgeon preferences, the
necessity for procedural awareness within autonomous systems, the establishment
of seamless human-robot information exchange, and the complexities of skill
acquisition in shared workspaces. This review synthesizes current trends,
identifies critical limitations, and outlines future research directions
essential to improve the reliability, safety, and effectiveness of human-robot

*Ajay Shankar,Keisuke Okumura,Amanda Prorok*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种多机器人控制框架，结合集中式路径规划和分散式轨迹控制，实现高效、可扩展的点对点导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人在全环境信息下的点对点导航问题，同时确保路径无碰撞、无死锁，并适应动态环境。

Method: 采用分层框架：1）集中式离散路径规划（基于MAPF）；2）分散式连续轨迹控制。结合LaCAM和Freyja实现。

Result: 展示了15架真实多旋翼机器人的动态导航能力，适应异步目标更新和动态环境。

Conclusion: 该框架为多机器人导航提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于动态和复杂环境。

Abstract: We propose a multi-robot control paradigm to solve point-to-point navigation
tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment
information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high
frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing
collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in
multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal
trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their
assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation
from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables
the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an
instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast
state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack
(Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and
versatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous
and partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick
replanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations,
including the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target
updates while a person walks through the operational workspace.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人形机器人在音乐表演等表达性领域的潜力，解决鼓乐演奏中的快速反应和多肢协调等挑战。

Method: 将鼓乐演奏建模为时序接触任务，分解乐曲为固定长度片段，并通过强化学习训练单一策略。

Result: 在三十多首流行摇滚、金属和爵士乐曲中，Robot Drummer表现出高F1分数，并展现出类似人类的鼓乐策略。

Conclusion: 研究表明强化学习能有效推动人形机器人进入创造性音乐表演领域。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have seen remarkable advances in dexterity, balance, and
locomotion, yet their role in expressive domains, such as music performance,
remains largely unexplored. Musical tasks, like drumming, present unique
challenges, including split-second timing, rapid contacts, and multi-limb
coordination over pieces lasting minutes. In this paper, we introduce Robot
Drummer, a humanoid system capable of expressive, high-precision drumming
across a diverse repertoire of songs. We formulate humanoid drumming as
sequential fulfillment of timed-contacts and transform drum scores in to a
Rhythmic Contact Chain. To handle the long-horizon nature of musical
performance, we decompose each piece into fixed-length segments and train a
single policy across all segments in parallel using reinforcement learning.
Through extensive experiments on over thirty popular rock, metal, and jazz
tracks, our results demonstrate that Robot Drummer consistently achieves high
F1 scores. The learned behaviors exhibit emergent human-like drumming
strategies, such as cross-arm strikes, and adaptive sticks assignments,
demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning to bring humanoid robots
into the domain of creative musical performance. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）的框架，用于检测手术协作场景中的指令歧义，以提高人机交互的安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指令的歧义在安全关键的人机交互（如手术）中带来显著风险，需要一种方法来检测和解决这些歧义。

Method: 采用LLM评估器集合，结合不同的提示技术识别多种歧义类型，并通过共形预测综合评估结果。

Result: 在Llama 3.2 11B和Gemma 3 12B模型上，分类准确率超过60%，能够区分手术指令的歧义性。

Conclusion: 该框架为手术中的人机协作提供了识别潜在歧义指令的机制，从而提升安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language instructions poses significant risks in
safety-critical human-robot interaction, particularly in domains such as
surgery. To address this, we propose a framework that uses Large Language
Models (LLMs) for ambiguity detection specifically designed for collaborative
surgical scenarios. Our method employs an ensemble of LLM evaluators, each
configured with distinct prompting techniques to identify linguistic,
contextual, procedural, and critical ambiguities. A chain-of-thought evaluator
is included to systematically analyze instruction structure for potential
issues. Individual evaluator assessments are synthesized through conformal
prediction, which yields non-conformity scores based on comparison to a labeled
calibration dataset. Evaluating Llama 3.2 11B and Gemma 3 12B, we observed
classification accuracy exceeding 60% in differentiating ambiguous from
unambiguous surgical instructions. Our approach improves the safety and
reliability of human-robot collaboration in surgery by offering a mechanism to
identify potentially ambiguous instructions before robot action.

### [183] [Learning to Quantize and Precode in Massive MIMO Systems for Energy Reduction: a Graph Neural Network Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10634)
*Thomas Feys,Liesbet Van der Perre,François Rottenberg*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的非线性预编码方法，用于解决大规模MIMO系统中粗量化DAC的硬件复杂性和功耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模MIMO系统的发展，DAC在硬件复杂性和功耗方面成为瓶颈，需要一种高效的方法来优化粗量化下的性能。

Method: 使用图神经网络（GNN）直接输出预编码的量化向量，并通过自监督训练最大化可达速率。采用Gumbel-softmax梯度估计解决目标函数的不可微问题。

Result: 在粗量化下，该方法显著提高了可达总速率。例如，单用户情况下，使用1位DAC即可达到与3位DAC的MRT相同的总速率，功耗降低4-7倍（基带DAC）和3倍（射频DAC）。

Conclusion: 该方法在特定带宽范围内显著降低了整体功耗，但增加了数字信号处理的功耗。未考虑的其他间接效应可能进一步降低功耗。

Abstract: Massive MIMO systems are moving toward increased numbers of radio frequency
chains, higher carrier frequencies and larger bandwidths. As such,
digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of
hardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding
for coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard
nature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly
outputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the
intended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by
directly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability
of the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC
functions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is
proposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum
rate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the
proposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission
(MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the
DAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs
respectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal
processing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in
overall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for
baseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for
higher bandwidths. Notably, indirect effects, which further reduce the power
consumption, such as a reduced fronthaul consumption and reduction in other
components, are not considered in this analysis.

*Mahdieh Zaker,Amy Nejati,Abolfazl Lavaei*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于数据驱动的组合方法，用于安全认证无限网络，解决了传统有限网络分析方法不适用的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无限网络的复杂性和未知性使得传统分析方法失效，需要新的数据驱动方法来解决其安全认证问题。

Method: 利用子系统的联合耗散性特性和存储证书，构建无限网络的屏障证书，无需精确了解互连拓扑。

Result: 该方法显著降低了样本复杂度（从指数级降至线性级），并消除了传统耗散性条件的检查需求。

Conclusion: 提出的组合数据驱动方法有效解决了无限网络的安全认证问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Infinite networks are complex interconnected systems comprising a countably
infinite number of subsystems, where counting them precisely poses a
significant challenge due to the seemingly endless interconnected nature of the
network (e.g., counting vehicles on the road). In such scenarios, the presence
of infinitely many subsystems within the network renders the existing analysis
frameworks tailored for finite networks inapplicable to infinite ones. This
paper is concerned with offering a data-driven approach, within a compositional
framework, for the safety certification of infinite networks with both unknown
mathematical models and interconnection topologies. Given the immense
computational complexity stemming from the extensive dimension of infinite
networks, our approach capitalizes on the joint dissipativity-type properties
of subsystems, characterized by storage certificates. We introduce innovative
compositional data-driven conditions to construct a barrier certificate for the
infinite network leveraging storage certificates of its unknown subsystems
derived from data, while offering correctness guarantees across the network
safety. We demonstrate that our compositional data-driven reasoning eliminates
the requirement for checking the traditional dissipativity condition, which
typically mandates precise knowledge of the interconnection topology. In
addition, while existing data-driven literature demonstrates an exponential
trend in sample complexity with respect to network size, we showcase that our
compositional strategy notably reduces it to a linear scale in terms of the
number of subsystems. We illustrate our data-driven results on two physical
infinite networks with unknown models and interconnection topologies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“lexicographic IBR over time”的方法，用于高效计算具有排序偏好的博弈问题，避免了传统方法的计算复杂度增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要在多个目标（如最短时间、安全性、交通协调）之间平衡，而现有的排序偏好博弈方法在时间、玩家数量或偏好层级增加时计算复杂度高。

Method: 采用“lexicographic IBR over time”方法，结合过去信息加速收敛，在滚动时域框架中近似求解排序偏好博弈。

Result: 通过模拟交通场景验证，该方法能高效计算近似最优解，并收敛至广义纳什均衡。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了排序偏好博弈的计算复杂度问题，适用于自动驾驶车辆的决策优化。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must balance ranked objectives, such as minimizing travel
time, ensuring safety, and coordinating with traffic. Games of ordered
preference effectively model these interactions but become computationally
intractable as the time horizon, number of players, or number of preference
levels increase. While receding horizon frameworks mitigate long-horizon
intractability by solving sequential shorter games, often warm-started, they do
not resolve the complexity growth inherent in existing methods for solving
games of ordered preference. This paper introduces a solution strategy that
avoids excessive complexity growth by approximating solutions using
lexicographic iterated best response (IBR) in receding horizon, termed
"lexicographic IBR over time." Lexicographic IBR over time uses past
information to accelerate convergence. We demonstrate through simulated traffic
scenarios that lexicographic IBR over time efficiently computes
approximate-optimal solutions for receding horizon games of ordered preference,
converging towards generalized Nash equilibria.

*Sehyun Ryu,Hyun Jong Yang*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信道预测的参考信号分配方法（CPRS），联合优化信道预测和DM-RS分配，无需CSI反馈即可提升数据吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在5G及未来网络中，大规模MIMO系统的天线数量增加导致CSI反馈需求激增，现有研究主要集中在CSI压缩和预测，但参考信号分配在CSI受限条件下尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出CPRS方法，结合ViViT/CNN架构，将CSI矩阵视为序列图像数据，实现动态环境中的高效自适应传输。

Result: 仿真结果显示，相比基准策略，吞吐量提升高达36.60%。

Conclusion: CPRS方法有效解决了CSI反馈开销问题，为5G-Advanced标准提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as
the growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially
increases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency
division duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused
on CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining
momentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced
standards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited
beamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such
constraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce
the concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS),
which jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data
throughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a
standards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by
treating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling
efficient and adaptive transmission in dynamic environments. Simulation results
using ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed
method, showing up to 36.60% throughput improvement over benchmark strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络物理系统（CPS）面临日益增长的攻击威胁，需要一种有效的主动防御方法。蜜罐部署作为一种防御手段，其信号博弈模型尚未充分研究。

Method: 将蜜罐部署建模为γ固定信号博弈，节点活跃度作为唯一信号。定义了γ-完美贝叶斯-纳什均衡，并通过离散时间虚拟博弈算法结合贝叶斯信念更新与经验最佳响应。

Result: 获得了所有γ-PBNE的解析表达式，揭示了三种均衡状态。证明了虚拟博弈路径收敛于防御最优均衡，数值结果验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在网络平均效用最大化方面表现优异，适用于CPS防御，为主动防御提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are facing a fast-growing wave of attacks. To
achieve effective proactive defense, this paper models honeypot deployment as a
gamma-fixed signaling game in which node liveness serves as the only signal and
normal-node signal gamma is exogenously fixed. We define the gamma-perfect
Bayesian-Nash equilibrium (gamma-PBNE). Analytical expressions are obtained for
all gamma-PBNEs, revealing three distinct equilibrium regimes that depend on
the priori honeypot ratio. Furthermore, the optimal honeypot ratio and
signaling strategy that jointly maximize the network average utility are
obtained. To capture strategic interaction over time, we develop a
discrete-time fictitious-play algorithm that couples Bayesian belief updates
with empirical best responses. We prove that, as long as the honeypot ratio is
perturbed within a non-degenerate neighbourhood of the optimum, every
fictitious-play path converges to the defender-optimal gamma-PBNE. Numerical
results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate its
applicability to CPS defense.

Method: 建模测量事件为独立泊松过程，推导后验协方差矩阵上界，并基于梯度优化测量率和辅助状态动态。

Result: 提出了一种确定性测量时间调度方法，实验显示在资源使用和估计精度间取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: 通过优化框架，实现了资源消耗与估计精度的有效权衡，适用于状态空间滤波和动态时间高斯过程回归。

Abstract: We study the Continuous-Discrete Kalman Filter (CD-KF) for State-Space Models
(SSMs) where continuous-time dynamics are observed via multiple sensors with
discrete, irregularly timed measurements. Our focus extends to scenarios in
which the measurement process is coupled with the states of an auxiliary SSM.
For instance, higher measurement rates may increase energy consumption or heat
generation, while a sensor's accuracy can depend on its own spatial trajectory
or that of the measured target. Each sensor thus carries distinct costs and
constraints associated with its measurement rate and additional constraints and
costs on the auxiliary state. We model measurement occurrences as independent
Poisson processes with sensor-specific rates and derive an upper bound on the
mean posterior covariance matrix of the CD-KF along the mean auxiliary state.
The bound is continuously differentiable with respect to the measurement rates,
which enables efficient gradient-based optimization. Exploiting this bound, we
propose a finite-horizon optimal control framework to optimize measurement
rates and auxiliary-state dynamics jointly. We further introduce a
deterministic method for scheduling measurement times from the optimized rates.
Empirical results in state-space filtering and dynamic temporal Gaussian
process regression demonstrate that our approach achieves improved trade-offs
between resource usage and estimation accuracy.

Motivation: MCI被广泛用于碳感知计算和电网灵活性优化，但其实际效果受到质疑。本文旨在揭示MCI的根本局限性。

Method: 通过分析MCI的非可观测性、依赖不透明预测模型和缺乏可验证性等局限性，提出其不可靠性。

Result: MCI无法反映高碳源导致的削减，也无法提供关于过剩电力量的信息。

Conclusion: 建议放弃MCI，转而研究更实用的指标，如直接报告过剩电力、明确建模储能和电网稳定性，并与新兴的可再生能源证书市场结合。

Abstract: Marginal Carbon Intensity (MCI) has been promoted as an effective metric for
carbon-aware computing. Although it is already considered as impractical for
carbon accounting purposes, many still view it as valuable when optimizing for
grid flexibility by incentivizing electricity usage during curtailment periods.
In this statement paper, we argue that MCI is neither reliable nor actionable
for either purpose. We outline its fundamental limitations, including
non-observability, reliance on opaque predictive models, and the lack of
verifiability. Moreover, MCI fails to reflect curtailment caused by high-carbon
sources and offers no insight into the quantity of available excess power. We
advocate moving beyond MCI and instead call for research on more actionable
metrics, such as direct reporting of excess power, explicit modeling of energy
storage and grid stability, and integration with emerging granular renewable
energy certificate markets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于精确惩罚函数的逆最优控制方法，用于处理带不等式约束的噪声演示数据，提高了估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆最优控制（IOC）在估计未知目标函数时，传统方法依赖于约束的正确激活和满足，这在噪声演示中受限。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用精确惩罚函数的概念，减少未知变量数量，并通过近似增强对错误约束激活的处理能力。

Result: 在仿真实验中，该方法在噪声演示下优于传统松弛方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了带约束噪声演示下的逆最优控制估计精度。

Abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) is a promising paradigm for learning and
mimicking optimal control strategies from capable demonstrators, or gaining a
deeper understanding of their intentions, by estimating an unknown objective
function from one or more corresponding optimal control sequences. When
computing estimates from demonstrations in environments with safety-preserving
inequality constraints, acknowledging their presence in the chosen IOC method
is crucial given their strong influence on the final control strategy. However,
solution strategies capable of considering inequality constraints, such as the
inverse Karush-Kuhn-Tucker approach, rely on their correct activation and
fulfillment; a restrictive assumption when dealing with noisy demonstrations.
To overcome this problem, we leverage the concept of exact penalty functions
for IOC and show preservation of estimation accuracy. Considering noisy
demonstrations, we then illustrate how the usage of penalty functions reduces
the number of unknown variables and how their approximations enhance the
estimation method's capacity to account for wrong constraint activations within
a polytopic-constrained environment. The proposed method is evaluated for three
systems in simulation, outperforming traditional relaxation approaches for
noisy demonstrations.

Result: 在非平稳参数不确定性下，RAAR-MPC精确达到目标风险水平，平均成本显著低于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAAR-MPC在保证机会约束的同时，显著降低了保守性，适用于非平稳不确定性系统。

Abstract: Solving chance-constrained optimal control problems for systems subject to
non-stationary uncertainties is a significant challenge.Conventional robust
model predictive control (MPC) often yields excessive conservatism by relying
on static worst-case assumptions, while standard stochastic MPC methods
struggle when underlying uncertainty distributions are unknown a priori.This
article presents a Risk-Aware Adaptive Robust MPC (RAAR-MPC) framework,a
hierarchical architecture that systematically orchestrates a novel synthesis of
proactive, learning-based risk assessment and reactive risk regulation. The
framework employs a medium-frequency risk assessment engine, which leverages
Gaussian process regression and active learning, to construct a tight,
data-driven characterization of the prediction error set from operational
data.Concurrently, a low-timescale outer loop implements a self-correcting
update law for an adaptive safety margin to precisely regulate the empirical
risk and compensate for unmodeled dynamics.This dual-timescale adaptation
enables the system to rigorously satisfy chance constraints with a user-defined
probability, while minimizing the conservatism inherent in traditional
approaches.We formally establish that the interplay between these adaptive
components guarantees recursive feasibility and ensures the closed-loop system
satisfies the chance constraints up to a user-defined risk level with high
probability.Numerical experiments on a benchmark DC-DC converter under
non-stationary parametric uncertainties demonstrate that our framework
precisely achieves the target risk level, resulting in a significantly lower
average cost compared to state-of-the-art robust and stochastic MPC strategies.

Motivation: 肺炎（如COVID-19引发的）需要快速准确诊断，研究旨在探索自动化检测的最佳方法。

Method: 评估了多种方法，包括传统机器学习（如PCA聚类、逻辑回归）和深度学习（如CNN、Vision Transformers），使用5,856张儿科胸片。

Result: Cross-ViT表现最佳，准确率88.25%，召回率99.42%，且模型架构比大小更重要。

Conclusion: Vision Transformers在肺炎检测中具有潜力，可提升诊断速度和准确性。

Abstract: Pneumonia, particularly when induced by diseases like COVID-19, remains a
critical global health challenge requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis. This
study presents a comprehensive comparison of traditional machine learning and
state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for automated pneumonia detection
using chest X-rays (CXRs). We evaluate multiple methodologies, ranging from
conventional machine learning techniques (PCA-based clustering, Logistic
Regression, and Support Vector Classification) to advanced deep learning
architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (Modified LeNet,
DenseNet-121) and various Vision Transformer (ViT) implementations (Deep-ViT,
Compact Convolutional Transformer, and Cross-ViT). Using a dataset of 5,856
pediatric CXR images, we demonstrate that Vision Transformers, particularly the
Cross-ViT architecture, achieve superior performance with 88.25% accuracy and
99.42% recall, surpassing traditional CNN approaches. Our analysis reveals that
architectural choices impact performance more significantly than model size,
with Cross-ViT's 75M parameters outperforming larger models. The study also
addresses practical considerations including computational efficiency, training
requirements, and the critical balance between precision and recall in medical
diagnostics. Our findings suggest that Vision Transformers offer a promising
direction for automated pneumonia detection, potentially enabling more rapid
and accurate diagnosis during health crises.

Motivation: 医疗图像的快速增长对存储和传输提出了挑战，压缩需在保留诊断细节的同时满足临床需求。

Method: 提出基于数据结构（2D vs 3D/4D）和技术方法（传统 vs 学习型）的分类法，系统分析技术演变。

Result: 传统方法提供理论支持，深度学习方法适应性强，两者各有优势。

Conclusion: 未来医疗图像压缩需结合传统与深度学习方法，解决多模态需求。

Abstract: The exponential growth of medical imaging has created significant challenges
in data storage, transmission, and management for healthcare systems. In this
vein, efficient compression becomes increasingly important. Unlike natural
image compression, medical image compression prioritizes preserving diagnostic
details and structural integrity, imposing stricter quality requirements and
demanding fast, memory-efficient algorithms that balance computational
complexity with clinically acceptable reconstruction quality. Meanwhile, the
medical imaging family includes a plethora of modalities, each possessing
different requirements. For example, 2D medical image (e.g., X-rays,
histopathological images) compression focuses on exploiting intra-slice spatial
redundancy, while volumetric medical image faces require handling intra-slice
and inter-slice spatial correlations, and 4D dynamic imaging (e.g., time-series
CT/MRI, 4D ultrasound) additionally demands processing temporal correlations
between consecutive time frames. Traditional compression methods, grounded in
mathematical transforms and information theory principles, provide solid
theoretical foundations, predictable performance, and high standardization
levels, with extensive validation in clinical environments. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches demonstrate remarkable adaptive learning capabilities
and can capture complex statistical characteristics and semantic information
within medical images. This comprehensive survey establishes a two-facet
taxonomy based on data structure (2D vs 3D/4D) and technical approaches
(traditional vs learning-based), thereby systematically presenting the complete
technological evolution, analyzing the unique technical challenges, and
prospecting future directions in medical image compression.

Motivation: 传统MAE在医学图像中因纹理特征重要性而表现不佳，GLCM-MAE通过匹配GLCM矩阵的损失函数保留形态特征。

Method: 提出GLCM-MAE框架，使用GLCM矩阵匹配作为重建损失，并设计可微的GLCM损失函数。

Result: 在胆囊癌、乳腺癌、肺炎和COVID检测任务中，GLCM-MAE分别提升2.1%、3.1%、0.5%和0.6%。

Conclusion: GLCM-MAE通过GLCM损失有效保留医学图像的形态特征，显著提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a dominant strategy for
self-supervised representation learning in natural images, where models are
pre-trained to reconstruct masked patches with a pixel-wise mean squared error
(MSE) between original and reconstructed RGB values as the loss. We observe
that MSE encourages blurred image re-construction, but still works for natural
images as it preserves dominant edges. However, in medical imaging, when the
texture cues are more important for classification of a visual abnormality, the
strategy fails. Taking inspiration from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
feature in Radiomics studies, we propose a novel MAE based pre-training
framework, GLCM-MAE, using reconstruction loss based on matching GLCM. GLCM
captures intensity and spatial relationships in an image, hence proposed loss
helps preserve morphological features. Further, we propose a novel formulation
to convert matching GLCM matrices into a differentiable loss function. We
demonstrate that unsupervised pre-training on medical images with the proposed
GLCM loss improves representations for downstream tasks. GLCM-MAE outperforms
the current state-of-the-art across four tasks - gallbladder cancer detection
from ultrasound images by 2.1%, breast cancer detection from ultrasound by
3.1%, pneumonia detection from x-rays by 0.5%, and COVID detection from CT by
0.6%. Source code and pre-trained models are available at:

Abstract: The increasing penetration rate of new energy in the power system has put
forward higher requirements for the operation and maintenance of substations
and transmission lines. Using the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to identify
foreign object in real time can quickly and effectively eliminate potential
safety hazards. However, due to the limited computation power, the captured
image cannot be real-time processed on edge devices in UAV locally. To overcome
this problem, a lightweight model based on an improved wavelet scatter deep
network is proposed. This model contains improved wavelet scattering network
for extracting the scatter coefficients and modulus coefficients of image
single channel, replacing the role of convolutional layer and pooling layer in
convolutional neural network. The following 3 fully connected layers, also
constituted a simplified Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), are used to classify the
extracted features. Experiments prove that the model constructed with
biorthogonal wavelets basis is able to recognize and classify the foreign
object in edge devices such as Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano, with accuracy
higher than 90% and inference time less than 7ms for 720P (1280*720) images.
Further experiments demonstrate that the recognition accuracy of our model is
1.1% higher than YOLOv5s and 0.3% higher than YOLOv8s.

Abstract: Pedestrians and bicyclists are among the vulnerable road users (VRUs) that
are inherently exposed to intricate traffic scenarios, which puts them at
increased risk of sustaining injuries or facing fatal outcomes. This study
presents an intelligent adaptive system that uses the YOLOv8-Dynamic (YOLOv8-D)
algorithm that detects vulnerable road users and adapts in real time to prevent
accidents before they occur. We select YOLOv8x as the detector by comparing it
with other state-of-the-art object detection models, including Faster-RCNN,
YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and variants. Compared to YOLOv5x, YOLOv8x shows improvements
of 12.14% in F1 score and 45.61% in mean Average Precision (mAP). Against
YOLOv7x, the improvements are 21.26% in F1 score and 128.44% in mAP. Our
algorithm integrates continual learning ability in the architecture of the
YOLOv8 detector to adjust to evolving road conditions flexibly, ensuring
adaptability across multiple dataset domains and facilitating continuous
enhancement of detection and tracking accuracy for VRUs, embracing the dynamic
nature of real-world environments. In our proposed framework, we optimized the
gradient descent mechanism of YOLOv8 model and train our optimized algorithm on
two statistically different datasets in terms of image viewpoint and number of
classes to achieve a 21.08% improvement in F1 score and a 31.86% improvement in
mAP as compared to a custom YOLOv8 framework trained on a new dataset, thus
overcoming the issue of catastrophic forgetting, which occurs when deep models
are trained on statistically different types of datasets.

Conclusion: U-RWKV为资源受限环境提供了一种高效的医疗图像分割解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving equity in healthcare accessibility requires lightweight yet
high-performance solutions for medical image segmentation, particularly in
resource-limited settings. Existing methods like U-Net and its variants often
suffer from limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), hindering their
ability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose U-RWKV,
a novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV)
architecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N)
computational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the
Direction-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive
Squeeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE). DARM employs Dual-RWKV and QuadScan
mechanisms to aggregate contextual cues across images, mitigating directional
bias while preserving global context and maintaining high computational
efficiency. SASE dynamically adapts its architecture to different feature
extraction stages, balancing high-resolution detail preservation and semantic
relationship capture. Experiments demonstrate that U-RWKV achieves
state-of-the-art segmentation performance with high computational efficiency,
offering a practical solution for democratizing advanced medical imaging
technologies in resource-constrained environments. The code is available at

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is vital for monitoring environmental and
urban transformations but faces challenges like manual feature extraction and
sensitivity to noise. Traditional methods and early deep learning models, such
as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to capture long-range
dependencies and global context essential for accurate change detection in
complex scenes. While Transformer-based models mitigate these issues, their
computational complexity limits their applicability in high-resolution remote
sensing. Building upon ChangeMamba architecture, which leverages state space
models for efficient global context modeling, this paper proposes precision
fusion blocks to capture channel-wise temporal variations and per-pixel
differences for fine-grained change detection. An enhanced decoder pipeline,
incorporating lightweight channel reduction mechanisms, preserves local details
with minimal computational cost. Additionally, an optimized loss function
combining Cross Entropy, Dice and Lovasz objectives addresses class imbalance
and boosts Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Evaluations on SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD+,
and WHU-CD datasets demonstrate superior precision, recall, F1 score, IoU, and
overall accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the
approach's robustness for remote sensing change detection. For complete

Motivation: CT成像面临时间消耗大和辐射暴露高的问题，稀疏视图CT重建方法可以降低成本与风险，但现有方法在2D与3D模态的潜在空间对齐上存在不足。

Method: 提出CLS-DM模型，利用跨模态特征对比学习，从2D X射线图像中提取3D潜在信息，并实现模态间的潜在空间对齐。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely utilized imaging modality in clinical
settings. Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D
spatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant
time consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based
on sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from
researchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent
years, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have
demonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.
Nonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent
representation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT
modalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment
within the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent
Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature
contrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray
images and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental
results indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art
generative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the
LIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing
the effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but
can also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as
text-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research
and applications in other domains.

Abstract: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for
reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to
complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited
annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions
Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity
Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically
combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a
wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a
biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature
enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained
and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate
uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and
lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without
sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate
that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an
average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap
error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the

Motivation: 在半导体封装中，准确恢复3D信息对非破坏性测试（NDT）和电路缺陷定位至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了深度学习和物理驱动优化结合在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial
for non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper
presents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR),
which leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the
3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning
(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based
constraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:
i) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\ell/z_o$), where $\ell$
is the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic
sensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging
spatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for
the position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\ell$), current ($I$), and current
flow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer
then adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\ell$, $I$) to
minimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The
results demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information
with high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction
in semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining
DL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.
