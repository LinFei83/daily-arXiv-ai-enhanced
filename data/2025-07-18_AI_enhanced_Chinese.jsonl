We present SpectraLift, a fully\nself-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the\nMSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight\nper-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic\nlow-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the\nSRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an\n$\\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as\nthe optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network\nto map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate.

A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which\nencapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging\nsensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning.
