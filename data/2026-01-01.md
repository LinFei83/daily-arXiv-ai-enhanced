### [1] [The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850)
*Rahul Baxi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出DDFT协议评估语言模型的认知稳健性，发现模型规模与稳健性无关，错误检测能力是关键瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如MMLU、TruthfulQA）无法区分模型是否真正掌握知识，还是仅在理想条件下表现良好。需要测量模型在信息退化或对抗攻击下的稳健性。

Method: 提出Drill-Down and Fabricate Test（DDFT）协议，包含语义压缩和对抗性伪造测试。采用两系统认知模型（语义系统+认知验证器），评估9个前沿模型在8个知识领域、5个压缩级别下的表现（共1800次轮级评估）。

Result: 认知稳健性与传统设计范式正交：参数数量（r=0.083）和架构类型（r=0.153）均不显著预测稳健性。错误检测能力强烈预测整体稳健性（rho=-0.817）。旗舰模型表现出脆弱性，而较小模型可达到稳健性能。

Conclusion: 认知稳健性源于训练方法和验证机制，而非当前主流设计。DDFT框架为关键应用部署前评估认知稳健性提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.

*Xu Huang,Junwu Chen,Yuxing Fei,Zhuohan Li,Philippe Schwaller,Gerbrand Ceder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CASCADE是一个自进化的LLM智能体框架，通过持续学习和自我反思掌握复杂工具，在材料科学和化学任务中实现93.3%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体依赖预定义工具或脆弱的工具生成机制，限制了其在复杂科学任务中的能力和适应性。

Method: 提出CASCADE框架，通过两种元技能实现进化：1) 通过网页搜索和代码提取进行持续学习；2) 通过内省和知识图谱探索进行自我反思。

Result: 在包含116个任务的SciSkillBench基准测试中，使用GPT-5的CASCADE达到93.3%成功率，相比无进化机制的35.4%显著提升。

Conclusion: CASCADE通过积累可执行技能实现跨智能体和科学家的知识共享，推动了可扩展的AI辅助科学研究。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.

### [3] [A Proof-of-Concept for Explainable Disease Diagnosis Using Large Language Models and Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23932)
*Ioanna Gemou,Evangelos Lamprou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: McCoy框架结合大型语言模型与答案集编程，通过LLM将医学文献转化为ASP代码，结合患者数据进行疾病诊断，实现可解释的预测系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号AI在医疗领域的应用受限于高质量知识库构建的困难，需要一种方法克服这一障碍以实现准确的疾病预测。

Method: 开发McCoy框架，使用LLM将医学文献翻译为ASP代码，结合患者数据输入ASP求解器进行诊断推理。

Result: 初步实验表明McCoy在小规模疾病诊断任务上表现出色，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: McCoy成功整合了LLM与ASP的优势，创建了强大且可解释的疾病预测框架，为医疗AI应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.

### [4] [SPARK: Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24008)
*Gaurab Chhetri,Subasish Das,Tausif Islam Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPARK是一个基于多智能体LLM的个性化搜索框架，通过角色化智能体协作实现动态检索和个性化响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统个性化搜索受限于静态用户画像和单一检索流程，难以捕捉用户动态、多维的信息需求变化。

Method: 1. 定义角色、专业、任务上下文和领域构成的人物空间；2. 引入人物协调器动态激活相关智能体；3. 每个智能体执行独立的检索增强生成，配备长短期记忆存储和上下文推理模块；4. 通过共享内存库、迭代辩论和接力式知识转移实现智能体协作。

Result: 框架展示了分布式智能体行为如何通过最小协调规则产生涌现的个性化特性，并提供了关于协调效率、个性化质量和认知负载分布的可测试预测。

Conclusion: SPARK通过细粒度智能体专业化与协作检索的结合，为能够捕捉人类信息寻求行为的复杂性、流动性和上下文敏感性的下一代搜索系统提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Personalized search demands the ability to model users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs; a challenge for systems constrained by static profiles or monolithic retrieval pipelines. We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.

### [5] [ROAD: Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging for Zero-Shot Agent Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24040)
*Natchaya Temyingyong,Daman Jain,Neeraj Kumarsahu,Prabhat Kumar,Rachata Phondi,Wachiravit Modecrua,Krittanon Kaewtawee,Krittin Pachtrachai,Touchapon Kraisingkorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ROAD框架，通过自动化调试而非随机搜索优化LLM提示，无需标注数据集，在冷启动场景下高效提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实软件工程中，LLM代理开发初期缺乏标注数据集，传统自动提示优化方法依赖黄金标准开发集，难以应对混乱的生产日志和动态故障模式。

Method: 采用多智能体架构：分析器进行根因分析，优化器聚合模式，教练整合策略，将非结构化故障日志转化为结构化决策树协议。

Result: 在学术基准和生产知识管理引擎中，ROAD仅3次迭代即提升成功率5.6%，搜索准确率3.8%；零售领域复杂推理任务性能提升约19%。

Conclusion: 模拟人类工程中的故障分析与修复循环，为资源密集型RL训练提供了数据高效且可行的替代方案，适用于可靠LLM代理部署。

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance, yet current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on large, labeled gold-standard development sets to compute fitness scores for evolutionary or Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline. These findings suggest that mimicking the human engineering loop of failure analysis and patching offers a viable, data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive RL training for deploying reliable LLM agents.

### [6] [LoongFlow: Directed Evolutionary Search via a Cognitive Plan-Execute-Summarize Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24077)
*Chunhui Wan,Xunan Dai,Zhuo Wang,Minglei Li,Yanpeng Wang,Yinan Mao,Yu Lan,Zhiwen Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LoongFlow框架，将LLM集成到认知演化过程中，通过混合记忆系统和自适应选择机制，显著提升算法发现和机器学习管道优化的效率与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统演化方法在静态LLM向自改进智能体过渡时存在结构化推理不足、早熟收敛和高维代码空间探索效率低的问题，需要更高效的自主科学发现框架。

Method: 采用认知驱动的'计划-执行-总结'范式，结合混合演化记忆系统（多岛模型、MAP-Elites和自适应玻尔兹曼选择），平衡探索与利用，并实例化为通用智能体和ML智能体。

Result: 在AlphaEvolve基准和Kaggle竞赛中，LoongFlow比主流基线（如OpenEvolve、ShinkaEvolve）进化效率提升高达60%，且能发现更优解决方案。

Conclusion: LoongFlow通过推理密集的演化过程与长期架构一致性维护，显著降低了计算开销，推动了自主科学发现向专家级解决方案生成迈进。

Abstract: The transition from static Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-improving agents is hindered by the lack of structured reasoning in traditional evolutionary approaches. Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces. To address these challenges, we introduce LoongFlow, a self-evolving agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art solution quality with significantly reduced computational costs. Unlike "blind" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive "Plan-Execute-Summarize" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process. To sustain long-term architectural coherence, we incorporate a hybrid evolutionary memory system. By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions. LoongFlow marks a substantial step forward in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling the generation of expert-level solutions with reduced computational overhead.

### [7] [CogRec: A Cognitive Recommender Agent Fusing Large Language Models and Soar for Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24113)
*Jiaxin Hu,Tao Wang,Bingsan Yang,Hongrun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CogRec认知推荐代理，结合大语言模型与Soar认知架构，提升推荐系统的准确性、可解释性和长尾问题处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推荐系统中存在'黑盒'特性、知识幻觉和在线学习能力有限等问题，而认知架构知识获取困难，两者互补不足。

Method: 以Soar为符号推理引擎，利用LLM初始化知识并填充工作记忆，采用感知-认知-行动循环，遇瓶颈时动态查询LLM生成解决方案，通过Soar的组块机制转化为新生产规则。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的评估表明，CogRec在推荐准确性、可解释性和长尾问题处理方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: CogRec通过融合LLM与认知架构，实现了持续进化的知识库和高度可解释的推荐理由，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable capacity in understanding user preferences for recommendation systems. However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent "Black-Box" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.

### [8] [Graph-Based Exploration for ARC-AGI-3 Interactive Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24156)
*Evgenii Rudakov,Jonathan Shock,Benjamin Ultan Cowley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的图结构方法，用于解决ARC-AGI-3基准中的交互推理任务，通过视觉分割和系统化状态空间探索显著优于当前大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在需要交互推理的ARC-AGI-3任务中表现不佳，该基准要求智能体通过有限交互推断任务机制并适应复杂度递增的关卡，因此需要开发能够系统探索和跟踪状态的方法。

Method: 结合视觉帧处理与图结构状态空间探索：将视觉帧分割为有意义组件，基于视觉显著性优先选择动作，维护已探索状态和转移的有向图，通过跟踪访问状态和测试动作来优先选择到达未测试状态的最短路径动作。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-3预览挑战中，该方法在六个游戏的52个关卡中位解决30关，在私有排行榜排名第三，显著优于前沿基于LLM的智能体。

Conclusion: 即使无需学习，显式的图结构探索也能为交互推理提供强基线，突显了在稀疏反馈环境中系统化状态跟踪和动作优先级的重要性，这些是当前LLM未能捕捉任务动态的关键。

Abstract: We present a training-free graph-based approach for solving interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark. ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics. The code is open source and available at https://github.com/dolphin-in-a-coma/arc-agi-3-just-explore.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCP（科学上下文协议）是一个开源标准，旨在通过构建全球自主科学代理网络加速科学发现。它提供统一的资源集成规范和实验生命周期管理架构，已集成1600多个工具资源，促进异构AI系统与人类研究者的大规模安全协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前科学工具和资源分散在不同平台与机构中，缺乏统一标准，导致AI代理难以发现、调用和组合跨平台能力，且实验可重复性和协作效率低下。需要建立协议级标准化基础设施以实现规模化、多机构的代理驱动科学研究。

Method: 1. 设计基于两大支柱的协议：统一资源集成规范（描述和调用软件工具、模型、数据集、物理仪器等资源），以及编排实验生命周期管理的安全服务架构（包含中心化SCP枢纽和联邦式SCP服务器）。2. 构建科学发现平台，集成1600多个工具资源，支持实验注册、规划、执行、监控和归档的全流程管理。

Result: SCP实现了跨平台和机构边界的资源无缝发现与组合，支持端到端可追溯的工作流，显著降低了集成开销并增强了实验可重复性。在多样化用例中促进了异构AI系统与人类研究者的大规模安全协作。

Conclusion: SCP通过协议级的科学上下文和工具编排标准化，为可扩展、多机构、代理驱动的科学研究建立了关键基础设施，有望加速全球科学发现进程。

Abstract: We introduce SCP: the Science Context Protocol, an open-source standard designed to accelerate discovery by enabling a global network of autonomous scientific agents. SCP is built on two foundational pillars: (1) Unified Resource Integration: At its core, SCP provides a universal specification for describing and invoking scientific resources, spanning software tools, models, datasets, and physical instruments. This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility. By standardizing scientific context and tool orchestration at the protocol level, SCP establishes essential infrastructure for scalable, multi-institution, agent-driven science.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于深度强化学习的方法FRIPN，用于解决车队规模与混合车辆路径规划问题，能够在秒级时间内生成近似最优解，特别适用于大规模和时间受限的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSMVRP问题需要同时决策车队组成和路径规划，在短期车辆租赁和按需物流等实际场景中应用广泛，但其复杂性较高，尤其是在大规模和时间受限环境下存在显著挑战。

Method: 将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，设计名为FRIPN的新型策略网络，集成车队组成和路径决策，采用针对不同决策目标的专用输入嵌入（包括剩余图嵌入以辅助车辆使用决策）。

Conclusion: 该方法展现了在实际应用中的潜力，并为将基于DRL的技术扩展到其他VRP变体提供了有价值的启示。

Abstract: The Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (FSMVRP) is a prominent variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), extensively studied in operations research and computational science. FSMVRP requires simultaneous decisions on fleet composition and routing, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios such as short-term vehicle rental and on-demand logistics. However, these requirements also increase the complexity of FSMVRP, posing significant challenges, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for solving FSMVRP, capable of generating near-optimal solutions within a few seconds. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a novel policy network, termed FRIPN, that seamlessly integrates fleet composition and routing decisions. Our method incorporates specialized input embeddings designed for distinctdecision objectives, including a remaining graph embedding to facilitate effective vehicle employment decisions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained scenarios. These strengths highlight the potential of our approach for practical applications and provide valuable inspiration for extending DRL-based techniques to other variants of VRP.

TL;DR: 提出风险感知逐步对齐方法，在语言模型微调中引入嵌套风险度量，以控制模型偏移风险并抑制低概率高危害行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法多基于风险中性范式，难以应对参考策略偏移风险，且对罕见但危害性大的行为鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出风险感知逐步对齐方法，将安全对齐建模为词元级风险感知约束策略优化问题，通过基于嵌套风险度量的逐步对齐过程更新策略。

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持高帮助性的同时确保强安全性，显著抑制低概率高危害的不安全响应。

Conclusion: 风险感知逐步对齐方法通过显式引入风险意识，有效提升语言模型安全对齐的鲁棒性和可控性。

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Language Models (LMs) to exhibit desired behaviors, maintaining control over risk is critical for ensuring both safety and trustworthiness. Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需梯度更新或额外训练、通过后验引导信念细化的测试时自适应智能体，用于部分可观测环境下的LLM智能体探索推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在部分可观测环境下缺乏有效的实时信念更新机制，且传统方法依赖梯度更新或额外训练，计算开销大。

Method: 维护外部结构化环境状态信念，通过动作条件观察迭代更新，使用轻量级LLM代理估计信息增益以选择动作，并设计量化后验信念与真实环境一致性的奖励函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在潜在世界状态对齐方面优于提示增强或检索增强等推理时扩展基线方法，且集成开销显著降低。

Conclusion: 后验引导的信念细化机制能有效提升LLM智能体在部分可观测环境下的探索推理能力，为轻量级自适应智能体设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a test-time adaptive agent that performs exploratory inference through posterior-guided belief refinement without relying on gradient-based updates or additional training for LLM agent operating under partial observability. Our agent maintains an external structured belief over the environment state, iteratively updates it via action-conditioned observations, and selects actions by maximizing predicted information gain over the belief space. We estimate information gain using a lightweight LLM-based surrogate and assess world alignment through a novel reward that quantifies the consistency between posterior belief and ground-truth environment configuration. Experiments show that our method outperforms inference-time scaling baselines such as prompt-augmented or retrieval-enhanced LLMs, in aligning with latent world states with significantly lower integration overhead.

Motivation: AI领域长期面临开发能够解决广泛物理任务并泛化到新任务和环境的智能体的挑战。最近流行的方法是通过状态-动作轨迹训练世界模型，并用规划算法解决新任务。虽然规划通常在输入空间进行，但新兴方法尝试在学得的表示空间进行规划，以期通过抽象无关细节提高规划效率。本研究旨在系统探索这类方法（称为JEPA-WM）的技术选择，寻找最优方案。

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 现有对基础模型空间能力的评估多基于静态地图或文本查询，忽视了空间理解的交互性和经验驱动特性，需要更贴近真实认知过程的评估方法。

Method: 设计部分可观测的网格地图环境（含道路、交叉口、兴趣点），让智能体逐步探索并接收局部观测，通过六类空间任务评估其表现，系统比较不同探索策略、记忆表示（如序列、图结构）和推理方案的影响。

Result: 探索策略主要影响经验获取，对最终推理准确率影响有限；结构化记忆（尤其是序列和图表示）显著提升路径规划等结构密集型任务性能；推理方案影响多步推断效果；空间推理能力在模型规模超过一定阈值后趋于饱和。

Conclusion: 提升地图空间理解能力需要针对空间表示与推理的专门机制，而非单纯扩大模型规模；结构化记忆与高级推理提示对复杂空间任务至关重要。

Abstract: Map environments provide a fundamental medium for representing spatial structure. Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多使用相同数据集评估大语言模型的数学推理能力，这限制了结论的普适性，且可能无法全面反映数学任务中的多样化挑战。

Method: 使用密苏里大学数学竞赛中的微积分、解析几何和离散数学题目，测试GPT-4o-mini、Gemini-2.0-Flash和DeepSeek-V3三种模型，将其答案与标准解对比以计算准确率，并分析错误模式。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在三个数学领域均表现最佳；所有模型在几何题目上表现明显较弱；DeepSeek-V3错误多为计算和逻辑错误，GPT-4o-mini常见逻辑和方法错误，Gemini则多出现推理不完整和仓促下结论的问题。

Conclusion: 基于代表性不足的数学竞赛数据集评估大语言模型，能更深入地揭示其特有的错误模式，并突显其在结构化推理（尤其是几何领域）中持续存在的挑战。

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of Large Language Models, or LLMs, in mathematical reasoning has been the focus of several recent studies. However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly serving as autonomous agents, and their utilization of external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is considered a future trend. Current MCP evaluation sets suffer from issues such as reliance on external MCP services and a lack of difficulty awareness. To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents. We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency. Experiments conducted on various latest mainstream Large Language Models reveal significant performance differences in handling complex, multi-step tool invocations.

Motivation: 现有LLM受限于固定的上下文窗口长度，无法有效处理超长提示，需要一种能够扩展处理能力的推理方法。

Method: 提出RLM推理策略，将长提示视为外部环境，允许LLM通过程序化方式检查、分解提示，并对提示片段进行递归调用。

Result: RLM成功处理比模型上下文窗口长两个数量级的输入，在四个长上下文任务中显著优于基础LLM和常见长上下文框架，且查询成本相当或更低。

Conclusion: RLM是一种有效且高效的长提示处理策略，能够显著扩展LLM的实际处理能力。

Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in language tasks but often lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings. We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.

Abstract: This paper proposes a group deliberation oriented multi-agent conversational model to address the limitations of single large language models in complex reasoning tasks. The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent. The model achieves higher reasoning efficiency than mainstream multi-agent approaches, providing an effective and stable solution for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\%) and GAIA (72.8\%) using open-weight models. Our automated generation pipeline achieves over 81\% tool synthesis success rate, while the Practice module improves performance on AIME 2024/2025 by +2.7\% and +5.4\% respectively. Moreover, our Agent RL training achieves 40\% speedup with steady performance improvement on 7B LLMs, enhancing coding/reasoning and searching capabilities respectively up to 35\% and 21\% on Maths and general/multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽具备广泛领域知识，但常无法捕捉数据集特有的关键预测模式，需要结合统计建模来发现特定数据规律。

Method: 采用迭代对比统计建模误差组的方法发现语义特征描述，形式化为广义EM算法，联合优化特征描述符和统计模型参数，将冻结基础模型的分类判断作为潜在二元特征的噪声观测。

Conclusion: 该方法能发现数据集中特定模式（如建筑细节预测本地房价、系列电影成员预测用户偏好），显著超越单纯依赖基础模型领域知识的性能。

Abstract: We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.

Abstract: Technologies for automatically generating work schedules have been extensively studied; however, in long-term care facilities, the conditions vary between facilities, making it essential to interview the managers who create shift schedules to design facility-specific constraint conditions. The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.

At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations. Overall, the developed tools and methodology result in substantial time savings while ensuring consistent, high-quality annotations across different sensor modalities. The solution directly supports the DARTS project by accelerating the preparation of large annotated dataset in the project's standardized format, strengthening the technological base for autonomous vehicle research in Poland.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE)，一个用于开发智能体大语言模型的端到端基础设施，包含ROLL、ROCK和iFlow CLI三个组件，并发布了基于ALE训练的开放源代码智能体ROME。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源社区缺乏系统化、端到端的智能体开发基础设施，难以支持智能体在真实环境中进行多轮交互、行动观察和迭代优化。

Method: 1. 提出ALE生态系统，包含：ROLL（权重优化后训练框架）、ROCK（轨迹生成沙盒环境管理器）、iFlow CLI（高效上下文工程智能体框架）；2. 开发数据合成协议生成复杂行为数据；3. 提出Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA)算法，基于语义交互块而非单个令牌进行信用分配，提升长时程训练稳定性。

Result: 1. 发布ROME智能体，基于超过100万条轨迹训练；2. 提出Terminal Bench Pro基准测试，提升规模并控制数据污染；3. ROME在SWE-bench Verified和Terminal Bench等基准测试中表现优异，验证了ALE基础设施的有效性。

Conclusion: ALE为智能体大语言模型开发提供了系统化解决方案，ROME的成功表明该基础设施能够有效支持复杂智能体的训练和评估，推动开源智能体生态发展。

Abstract: Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过迭代部署LLM并基于用户从前一模型部署中精心筛选的数据进行微调，可以显著改变模型特性，在规划任务中实现能力提升和泛化能力涌现，并揭示了这种机制本质上是一种隐式强化学习过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索迭代部署和基于用户筛选数据的微调如何影响LLM的特性演化，特别是针对规划能力的提升机制，并理解这种部署模式与强化学习之间的理论联系及其潜在影响。

Method: 在多个规划领域测试迭代部署机制：每一轮部署的LLM基于用户从前一轮模型输出中精心筛选的数据进行微调，观察模型规划能力的变化，并通过理论分析将这一过程与强化学习框架进行对比。

Result: 迭代部署显著提升了模型的规划能力，后续模型展现出泛化能力，能够发现比初始模型长得多的规划方案；理论分析表明该机制实质上是一种外层循环的隐式强化学习，其奖励函数由用户数据筛选行为间接定义。

Conclusion: 迭代部署机制可视为一种替代显式强化学习的训练范式，它依赖数据筛选而非显式奖励；这对AI安全领域具有重要启示，因为隐式奖励函数可能导致未来模型部署出现意外特性，需引起关注。

Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.

TL;DR: 提出了STAgent，一个专为时空理解设计的智能大语言模型，能够处理受限兴趣点发现和行程规划等复杂任务，通过工具交互和分层训练方法在保持通用能力的同时提升专业性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在复杂时空推理任务（如受限条件下的兴趣点探索和行程规划）中表现有限，需要专门设计能够与多工具交互、保持推理稳定性的智能体模型。

Method: 1）构建支持十多种领域专用工具的稳定工具环境；2）设计分层数据筛选框架（筛选比1:10,000），从海量数据中提取高质量、多样且困难的查询；3）采用级联训练方案：种子SFT阶段评估查询难度→高确定性查询的二次SFT→低确定性数据的强化学习。

Result: 基于Qwen3-30B-A3B初始化的STAgent在TravelBench基准上表现优异，同时在广泛通用基准测试中保持了原有通用能力，验证了模型设计的有效性。

Conclusion: STAgent通过专用工具集成、高质量数据筛选和渐进式训练策略，成功构建了兼具时空任务专业能力和通用性的智能体模型，为复杂时空推理任务提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.

Abstract: This study presents a conceptual framework and a prototype assessment for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) AI agents to facilitate context-aware energy management in smart buildings through natural language interaction. The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%. This benchmarking study moves toward formalizing the assessment of LLM-based BEMS AI agents and identifying future research directions, emphasizing the trade-off between response accuracy and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用Depth Anything V2架构的合成先验知识，通过DV-LORA高效适应医疗领域，提升内窥镜环境下单目深度估计的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督方法在内窥镜手术的镜面反射和液体环境中表现脆弱，尤其在薄手术工具和透明表面易出现边界塌陷问题。

Method: 采用Depth Anything V2架构的高保真合成先验，通过动态向量低秩适应（DV-LORA）进行高效领域适应，并引入物理分层评估协议。

Result: 在SCARED数据集上达到98.1%的准确率（<1.25阈值），平方相对误差比基线降低17%以上，在不利手术光照条件下表现出优越鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过合成先验与高效领域适应的结合，显著提升了内窥镜环境下的深度估计性能，为手术机器人提供了更可靠的视觉感知能力。

Abstract: Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for robotic surgery but remains fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments. Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

Motivation: 解决长视频处理中上下文长度限制与细节保留的矛盾，降低自回归视频模型的长历史记忆成本。

Method: 设计PFP神经网络结构，采用显式预训练目标压缩视频，保留单帧高频细节；将预训练模型微调为记忆编码器，集成到自回归视频模型中。

Result: 模型可将20秒视频压缩至约5k长度的上下文，随机帧检索时感知外观保持良好；实现低成本长历史记忆，保真度损失相对较低。

Conclusion: PFP框架有效平衡视频压缩与细节保留，为长视频处理提供高效记忆编码方案，架构设计需权衡不同因素。

Abstract: We present PFP, a neural network structure to compress long videos into short contexts, with an explicit pretraining objective to preserve the high-frequency details of single frames at arbitrary temporal positions. The baseline model can compress a 20-second video into a context at about 5k length, where random frames can be retrieved with perceptually preserved appearances. Such pretrained models can be directly fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, enabling long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss. We evaluate the framework with ablative settings and discuss the trade-offs of possible neural architecture designs.

Abstract: 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种深度学习驱动的流程，可将婴幼儿的T1加权MRI转换为合成CT（sCT），实现颅骨分割和颅缝概率热图生成，填补了MRI无法直接评估颅骨和颅缝的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT常用于评估儿童颅骨发育和颅缝异常，但其电离辐射对无显著异常的儿童存在风险；MRI无辐射但无法清晰显示颅骨和颅缝，因此需要一种非侵入性方法从MRI中获取CT级别的颅骨结构信息。

Method: 采用深度学习驱动的流程，结合领域特定的变分自编码器，将0.2-2岁儿童的T1加权MRI转换为合成CT，并进一步生成颅骨分割、颅缝概率热图和直接颅缝分割。

Result: 合成CT与真实CT的结构相似度达99%，弗雷歇起始距离为1.01；颅骨分割在七块颅骨上的平均Dice系数为85%，颅缝分割Dice系数达80%；通过双侧等效性检验证实了合成CT与真实CT在分割结果上具有等效性（TOST p < 0.05）。

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现了从儿科MRI生成合成CT并进行颅缝分割，为无创性颅骨评估提供了关键技术支持，有望在避免辐射暴露的情况下辅助儿童颅骨发育异常的诊断与治疗。

Abstract: Quantifying normative pediatric cranial development and suture ossification is crucial for diagnosing and treating growth-related cephalic disorders. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了人工智能在超高分辨率光电遥感数据上的扩展规律，通过训练比现有规模大数个数量级的视觉Transformer骨干网络，揭示了遥感领域基础模型训练的数据限制特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态机器学习应用（如图像描述生成、搜索和推理）依赖于针对非文本模态的鲁棒、领域专用编码器。在自然图像领域，互联网规模数据充足且扩展规律明确，但在高价值领域如遥感中，模型容量、训练计算量和数据集规模之间的联合扩展关系尚不明确。

Method: 使用超过千万亿像素的商业卫星光电数据，在MITRE联邦AI沙箱中逐步训练更大规模的视觉Transformer（ViT）骨干网络，记录在拍字节（petascale）规模下的成功与失败模式，并分析跨遥感模态的领域差距。

Result: 研究发现，即使在此规模下，性能仍处于数据限制状态而非模型参数限制状态。实验揭示了遥感基础模型训练的实际扩展行为，为数据收集策略、计算预算和优化计划提供了依据。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来开发前沿规模的遥感基础模型提供了实用见解，表明当前遥感领域仍受数据量限制，需要进一步优化数据收集和计算资源配置策略。

Abstract: We explore the scaling behaviors of artificial intelligence to establish practical techniques for training foundation models on high-resolution electro-optical (EO) datasets that exceed the current state-of-the-art scale by orders of magnitude. Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural-image domains where internet-scale data is plentiful, well-established scaling laws help optimize the joint scaling of model capacity, training compute, and dataset size. Unfortunately, these relationships are much less well-understood in high-value domains like remote sensing (RS). Using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox, we train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, report success and failure modes observed at petascale, and analyze implications for bridging domain gaps across additional RS modalities. We observe that even at this scale, performance is consistent with a data limited regime rather than a model parameter-limited one. These practical insights are intended to inform data-collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules that advance the future development of frontier-scale RS foundation models.

Abstract: Traditionally, ultrasound skill assessment has relied on expert supervision and feedback, a process known for its subjectivity and time-intensive nature. Previous works on quantitative and automated skill assessment have predominantly employed supervised learning methods, often limiting the analysis to predetermined or assumed factors considered influential in determining skill levels. In this work, we propose a novel bi-level optimisation framework that assesses fetal ultrasound skills by how well a task is performed on the acquired fetal ultrasound images, without using manually predefined skill ratings. The framework consists of a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, which are optimised jointly by refining the two networks simultaneously. We validate the proposed method on real-world clinical ultrasound videos of scanning the fetal head. The results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting ultrasound skills by the proposed framework, which quantifies optimised task performance as a skill indicator.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于特征到图像扩散基础模型（F2IDiff FM）的单图像超分辨率方法，使用DINOv2特征作为低层特征条件，以在智能手机摄影中实现无幻觉的超分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在单图像超分辨率中虽有提升，但强生成可能导致不希望的幻觉，而智能手机相机需要高保真、无幻觉的超分辨率处理，现有基于文本到图像扩散模型的方法因文本特征高层且不适合小图像块而受限。

Conclusion: 基于低层特征条件的扩散模型能有效控制生成过程，避免幻觉，提升智能手机摄影中的超分辨率质量，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. We have made our source code publicly available at https://github.com/worldlikerr/MGML.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localisation (CVGL) aims to estimate the geographic location of a query image by matching it with images from a large-scale database. However, the significant view-point discrepancies present considerable challenges for effective feature aggregation and alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CVGL system that incorporates three key improvements. Firstly, we leverage the DINOv2 backbone with a convolution adapter fine-tuning to enhance model adaptability to cross-view variations. Secondly, we propose a multi-scale channel reallocation module to strengthen the diversity and stability of spatial representations. Finally, we propose an improved aggregation module that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing into the feature aggregation process. Specifically, the module dynamically selects expert subspaces for the keys and values in a cross-attention framework, enabling adaptive processing of heterogeneous input domains. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with fewer trained parameters.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

Abstract: Image dehazing is a critical challenge in computer vision, essential for enhancing image clarity in hazy conditions. Traditional methods often rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have improved performance by effectively analyzing image features. However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, and Transformers demand significant computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose DehazeSNN, an innovative architecture that integrates a U-Net-like design with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). DehazeSNN captures multi-scale image features while efficiently managing local and long-range dependencies. The introduction of the Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Block (OLIFBlock) enhances cross-channel communication, resulting in superior dehazing performance with reduced computational burden. Our extensive experiments show that DehazeSNN is highly competitive to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, delivering high-quality haze-free images with a smaller model size and less multiply-accumulate operations. The proposed dehazing method is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoranLiu507/DehazeSNN.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models has driven remarkable advancements in generating high-quality, temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models.

Abstract: This paper presents an effective solution for view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios. Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.

Conclusion: 该方法为利用免费多光谱卫星数据实现自动化、全球尺度的地表变化监测提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

Conclusion: 该方法在分割精度与计算效率间取得良好平衡，为临床部署提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of heterogeneous anatomical structures is pivotal for computer-aided diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision-making. Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.

Motivation: 自监督语义分割方法在处理外观模糊（如阴影、眩光、局部纹理）时容易失败，现有方法过度依赖不稳定的外观特征，需要引入更稳定的几何拓扑信息。

Conclusion: 通过引入稳定的拓扑信息并强制几何与外观特征对齐，GASeg框架能有效解决自监督语义分割中的外观模糊问题，提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating our approach of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

Abstract: This work presents a novel pipeline to recover the 3D structure of an unknown target spacecraft from a sequence of images captured during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) in space. The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that Visual Language Models (VLMs) hold great potential for tasks such as automated medical diagnosis. However, processing complex three-dimensional (3D) multimodal medical images poses significant challenges - specifically, the effective integration of complementary information and the occasional oversight of subtle yet critical pathological features. To address these issues, we present a novel two-stage fusion framework termed Hilbert-VLM. This framework leverages the HilbertMed-SAM module for precise lesion segmentation, with the generated multimodal enhanced prompts then guiding the VLM toward accurate disease classification. Our key innovation lies in the systematic redesign of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) architecture: we incorporate Hilbert space-filling curves into the scanning mechanism of the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) to maximize the preservation of spatial locality in 3D data, a property critical for medical image analysis. We also introduce a novel Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention (HMCA) mechanism and a scale-aware decoder to capture fine-grained details. Meanwhile, the prompt enhancement module unifies segmentation masks and their corresponding textual attributes into an information-dense prompt to support VLM inference. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the Hilbert-VLM model. On the BraTS2021 segmentation benchmark, it achieves a Dice score of 82.35 percent, with a diagnostic classification accuracy (ACC) of 78.85 percent. These results demonstrate that the proposed model offers substantial potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of medical VLM-based analysis.

Abstract: Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Realistic virtual try-on (VTON) concerns not only faithful rendering of garment details but also coordination of the style. Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. Code and data will be released.

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have demonstrated its potential as a compact image representation with millisecond-level decoding. However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

Conclusion: RSAgent通过交互式多轮推理与工具调用机制，有效解决了单次分割的局限性，为文本引导分割任务提供了更灵活可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Long-form video editing poses unique challenges due to the exponential increase in the computational cost from joint editing and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion across extended sequences. To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods. PipeFlow achieves up to a 9.6X speedup compared to TokenFlow and a 31.7X speedup over Diffusion Motion Transfer (DMT).

Abstract: Image denoising is an important problem in low-level vision and serves as a critical module for many image recovery tasks. Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.

Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

Abstract: Pathology context and expert experience play significant roles in clinical ocular disease diagnosis. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have good ocular disease recognition results, they often ignore exploring the clinical pathology context and expert experience priors to improve ocular disease recognition performance and decision-making interpretability. To this end, we first develop a novel Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to leverage the potential of pathology context prior via the combination of the well-designed pixel-wise context compression operator and pathology distribution concentration operator; then this paper applies a novel expert prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to further highlight significant pixel-wise representation regions by fully mining the expert experience prior. By incorporating PRM and EPGA into the modern DNN, the PCRNet is constructed for automated ocular disease recognition. Additionally, we introduce an Integrated Loss (IL) to boost the ocular disease recognition performance of PCRNet by considering the effects of sample-wise loss distributions and training label frequencies. The extensive experiments on three ocular disease datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCRNet with IL over state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods. Further visualization analysis explains the inherent behavior of PRM and EPGA that affects the decision-making process of DNNs.

Conclusion: 所提出的平衡层次对比损失与解耦学习策略能有效解决细粒度检测中的层次不平衡和任务干扰问题，提升检测性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为潜在运动推理（LMR）的新方法，通过两阶段的“思考-行动”决策过程来解决文本到运动生成中的语义-运动学阻抗失配问题，显著提升了语义对齐和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的文本到运动生成方法将问题视为直接映射，但面临语义-运动学阻抗失配的根本瓶颈：难以将语义密集的离散语言意图一次性接地到运动学密集的高频运动数据中。

Method: 提出潜在运动推理（LMR），采用两阶段生成架构：首先通过双粒度分词器将运动解耦为语义丰富的推理潜在空间（用于全局拓扑规划）和高频执行潜在空间（用于保持物理保真度），然后让模型先自回归推理（规划粗轨迹）再实例化帧。

Result: 在T2M-GPT（离散）和MotionStreamer（连续）两个代表性基线模型上实施LMR，实验表明该方法在语义对齐和物理合理性方面均取得了非平凡改进。

Conclusion: 运动规划的最佳基底不是自然语言，而是一个学习到的、与运动对齐的概念空间；通过强制模型先推理后执行，可以有效弥合语言与物理之间的不可言说性鸿沟。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

Conclusion: GeoBench为几何问题解决提供了全面基准，并为开发几何问题解决系统提供了可行的指导方针。

Abstract: Geometric problem solving constitutes a critical branch of mathematical reasoning, requiring precise analysis of shapes and spatial relationships. Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.

Abstract: A long-standing objective in humanoid robotics is the realization of versatile agents capable of following diverse multimodal instructions with human-level flexibility. Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and drones, has intensified the need to forge true Spatial Intelligence from multi-modal onboard sensor data. While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CropTrack框架，结合外观与运动信息解决农业场景多目标跟踪中的身份保持难题，在公开数据集上表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业环境多目标跟踪面临重复模式、目标外观相似、光照突变和频繁遮挡等挑战，现有基于运动的跟踪方法在强遮挡下难以保持目标身份，而外观特征因相似度高难以直接应用。

Method: 提出CropTrack框架：1）引入重排序增强的外观关联机制；2）设计基于外观冲突解决策略的一对多关联方法；3）建立指数移动平均原型特征库以优化外观关联。

Result: 在公开农业MOT数据集上，CropTrack实现了稳定的身份保持，相比传统基于运动的方法显著提升，在识别F1分数和关联准确率上取得显著增益，且身份切换次数更低。

Conclusion: CropTrack通过有效融合外观与运动信息，解决了农业场景中因外观相似和频繁遮挡导致的跟踪难题，为农业多目标跟踪提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.

*Pieter M. Blok,Haozhou Wang,Hyun Kwon Suh,Peicheng Wang,James Burridge,Wei Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PointRAFT网络，直接从部分点云预测马铃薯块茎重量，解决RGB-D相机因自遮挡导致的重量低估问题，实现高精度、高吞吐量估算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 马铃薯产量估算对优化农业栽培至关重要，但现有基于RGB-D相机的方法因点云不完整（自遮挡）会系统性地低估块茎重量，需开发能直接从不完整点云预测重量且满足收获机高吞吐量要求的方法。

Method: 提出PointRAFT点云回归网络，引入对象高度嵌入作为额外几何线索，直接从未经重建的原始部分点云预测连续3D形状属性（如重量），无需完整三维重建。

Result: 在来自4个品种、3个生长季的859个马铃薯的26,688个部分点云上训练评估，测试集（172个马铃薯的5,254个点云）上平均绝对误差12.0克、均方根误差17.2克，优于线性回归和PointNet++基线；单点云推理时间6.3毫秒，支持每秒150个块茎的处理速率。

Conclusion: PointRAFT能高精度、高效率地从不完整点云直接预测马铃薯重量，满足商用收获机的高吞吐量需求，且可扩展至其他3D表型分析和机器人感知任务。

Abstract: Potato yield is a key indicator for optimizing cultivation practices in agriculture. Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters. Beyond potato weight estimation, PointRAFT provides a versatile regression network applicable to a wide range of 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks. The code, network weights, and a subset of the dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/pieterblok/pointraft.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出两种方法改进基于大语言模型的计算机视觉架构自动设计：Few-Shot Architecture Prompting（FSAP）确定最佳示例数量，以及Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation实现高效去重，在七个视觉基准测试中生成1900个独特架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉任务多样且计算资源有限，需要高效的架构设计和搜索方法。大语言模型为替代计算密集的神经架构搜索提供了可能，但其在视觉架构生成中的应用尚未系统研究，特别是在提示工程和验证策略方面。

Method: 1. 提出Few-Shot Architecture Prompting（FSAP），系统研究支持示例数量（n=1-6）对LLM生成架构的影响；2. 提出Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation，轻量级去重方法（<1ms）；3. 在七个计算机视觉基准测试上进行大规模实验，生成1900个独特架构；4. 引入数据集平衡评估方法以解决异构任务比较难题。

Result: 1. 发现使用n=3个示例能在视觉任务中最佳平衡架构多样性和上下文聚焦；2. 去重方法比AST解析快100倍，避免重复训练；3. 实验验证了方法在多个视觉数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: 这些贡献为基于LLM的计算机视觉架构搜索提供了实用指南，建立了严谨的评估实践，使计算资源有限的研究者也能更便捷地进行自动化设计。

Abstract: Automated neural network architecture design remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.

TL;DR: 本文提出D²-Align框架，通过方向性修正奖励信号来缓解文本到图像扩散模型在人类偏好对齐中出现的偏好模式崩溃问题，并在质量和多样性方面实现更优的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈强化学习的方法虽然能在自动化奖励指标上获得高分，但常导致偏好模式崩溃——模型收敛于狭窄的高分输出模式（如单一风格或过度曝光），严重损害生成多样性。

Method: 提出方向性解耦对齐框架：1）在冻结奖励模型的嵌入空间中学习方向性修正；2）在优化过程中将修正应用于奖励信号，防止模型塌缩到特定模式。

Result: D²-Align在质量和多样性的综合评估中，相比现有方法能更好地维持生成多样性，同时保持与人类偏好的对齐。

Conclusion: 方向性修正奖励信号能有效缓解偏好模式崩溃问题，为文本到图像扩散模型的对齐提供了兼顾质量与多样性的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated significant progress in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preference via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了VLN-MME评估框架，用于在视觉语言导航任务中测试多模态大语言模型的零样本具身代理能力，发现现有模型在三维空间推理和上下文感知方面存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其作为需要多轮对话、空间推理和序列动作预测的具身代理的性能尚未充分探索，需要系统化评估框架。

Method: 构建了统一可扩展的评估框架VLN-MME，将传统导航数据集标准化为基准测试，采用模块化设计支持结构化比较和组件消融实验，测试了思维链推理和自我反思等增强策略。

Result: 研究发现，在基线代理中添加思维链推理和自我反思反而导致性能下降，表明多模态大语言模型在具身导航任务中上下文感知能力不足，三维空间推理保真度较低。

Conclusion: VLN-MME为系统评估通用多模态大语言模型在具身导航场景中的能力奠定了基础，揭示了其在序列决策方面的局限性，为后续模型训练提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

TL;DR: 提出EndoRare框架，通过单张参考图像生成多样化的罕见胃肠道病变合成图像，用于AI模型增强和临床培训。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见胃肠道病变在常规内镜检查中少见，导致可用于开发可靠AI模型和培训新医生的数据不足。

Method: 利用语言引导的概念解耦技术，将病变特征与非诊断属性分离，将前者编码为可学习的原型嵌入，并变化后者以确保多样性，无需重新训练。

Result: 合成图像被专家判定具有临床可信度；用于数据增强时显著提升AI分类器性能；新手内镜医生使用合成案例后，召回率提升0.400，精确率提升0.267。

Conclusion: 该框架为罕见疾病的计算机辅助诊断和临床教育提供了一种实用且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, restricting the data available for developing reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models and training novice clinicians. Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision. These results establish a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education.

IMDD-1M contains high-resolution real-world defects spanning over 60 material categories and more than 400 defect types, each accompanied by expert-verified annotations and fine-grained textual descriptions detailing defect location, severity, and contextual attributes. This dataset enables a wide spectrum of applications, including classification, segmentation, retrieval, captioning, and generative modeling. Building upon IMDD-1M, we train a diffusion-based vision-language foundation model from scratch, specifically tailored for industrial scenarios. The model serves as a generalizable foundation that can be efficiently adapted to specialized domains through lightweight fine-tuning. With less than 5% of the task-specific data required by dedicated expert models, it achieves comparable performance, highlighting the potential of data-efficient foundation model adaptation for industrial inspection and generation, paving the way for scalable, domain-adaptive, and knowledge-grounded manufacturing intelligence.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

Conclusion: DarkEQA填补了低光照条件下视觉语言模型评估的空白，为开发更鲁棒的具身智能体提供了重要基准和分析工具。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有方法难以在视频生成中独立控制空间（摄像机视角）和时间（运动序列），缺乏能够同时精确操控两者的模型。

Method: 1. 引入动画时间嵌入机制以显式控制输出视频的运动序列；2. 提出时间扭曲训练方案，利用多视角数据集模拟时间差异；3. 改进摄像机条件机制；4. 创建CamxTime合成数据集提供完整时空轨迹。

Conclusion: SpaceTimePilot通过创新的训练方案和数据集，成功实现了视频生成中空间和时间的独立精确控制，为动态场景的可控渲染提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

TL;DR: 提出贝叶斯自蒸馏（BSD）方法，通过贝叶斯推理构建样本特定目标分布，无需依赖硬标签，提升模型精度、校准性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络分类训练依赖硬标签，易导致过度自信、校准性差、泛化能力弱和鲁棒性不足；现有自蒸馏方法仍受硬标签限制，效果有限。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推理，利用模型自身预测构建样本特定目标分布，完全摆脱对硬标签的依赖，可与对比损失结合使用。

Result: 在多种架构和数据集上，BSD相比现有方法显著提升测试精度（如CIFAR-100上ResNet-50提升1.4%）并大幅降低校准误差（ECE减少40%），同时增强对数据损坏、扰动和标签噪声的鲁棒性；结合对比损失后在标签噪声下达到单阶段单网络方法的SOTA鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BSD为自蒸馏提供了理论严谨的框架，能有效提升模型性能与鲁棒性，且无需依赖硬标签，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Supervised training of deep neural networks for classification typically relies on hard targets, which promote overconfidence and can limit calibration, generalization, and robustness. Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets, reducing their effectiveness. With this in mind, we propose Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a principled method for constructing sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions. Unlike existing approaches, BSD does not rely on hard targets after initialization. BSD consistently yields higher test accuracy (e.g. +1.4% for ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100) and significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100) than existing architecture-preserving self-distillation methods for a range of deep architectures and datasets. Additional benefits include improved robustness against data corruptions, perturbations, and label noise. When combined with a contrastive loss, BSD achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise for single-stage, single-network methods.

*Zefeng He,Xiaoye Qu,Yafu Li,Tong Zhu,Siyuan Huang,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DiffThinker，一种基于扩散的生成式多模态推理框架，将多模态推理重新定义为图像到图像的生成任务，在视觉中心任务中显著优于现有MLLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的推理过程仍以文本为中心，在复杂长视野、视觉中心任务中表现不佳，需要更有效的视觉推理范式。

Method: 建立生成式多模态推理范式，开发DiffThinker框架，将多模态推理转化为原生图像到图像生成任务，系统比较该范式与MLLM的特性。

Result: DiffThinker在顺序规划、组合优化、约束满足和空间配置四个领域显著优于GPT-5（+314.2%）、Gemini-3-Flash（+111.6%）和微调Qwen3-VL-32B基线（+39.0%），展现出效率、可控性、原生并行和协作四大核心特性。

Conclusion: 生成式多模态推理是视觉中心推理的有前景方法，DiffThinker框架在逻辑一致性和空间精度方面表现优越，为多模态推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attained significant strides in multimodal reasoning, their reasoning processes remain predominantly text-centric, leading to suboptimal performance in complex long-horizon, vision-centric tasks. In this paper, we establish a novel Generative Multimodal Reasoning paradigm and introduce DiffThinker, a diffusion-based reasoning framework. Conceptually, DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task, achieving superior logical consistency and spatial precision in vision-centric tasks. We perform a systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs, providing the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2\%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6\%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0\%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as a promising approach for vision-centric reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了DermaVQA-DAS数据集，扩展了皮肤病视觉问答任务，新增皮肤病变分割任务，并提出了标准化的皮肤病评估框架DAS，用于评估多模态模型在患者中心皮肤病分析中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有皮肤病图像分析数据集主要关注皮肤镜图像，缺乏患者查询和临床背景，限制了其在患者中心护理中的应用。

Method: 提出皮肤病评估框架DAS，包含36个高级和27个细粒度评估问题；构建DermaVQA-DAS数据集，支持封闭式问答和病变分割任务；评估多种多模态模型和提示策略。

Result: 分割任务中，增强提示策略在多数投票评估下获得最佳性能（Jaccard指数0.395，Dice分数0.566）；封闭式问答任务中，o3模型总体准确率最高（0.798），GPT-4.1（0.796）和Gemini-1.5-Pro（0.783）表现接近。

Conclusion: DermaVQA-DAS数据集和DAS框架为患者中心皮肤病视觉语言建模研究提供了标准化基准，公开资源将加速该领域发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

*Md. Enamul Hoq,Linda Larson-Prior,Fred Prior*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发并验证了针对低剂量CT肺癌筛查的16位质量控制流程Virtual-Eyes，发现其对通用基础模型和专用模型的影响存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在低剂量CT肺癌筛查中的应用通常缺乏对预处理步骤的量化评估，且不同模型对数据质量的敏感度未知，需要系统评估质量控制流程对不同类型模型的影响。

Method: 开发了Virtual-Eyes质量控制流程，包括强制512x512平面分辨率、筛选诊断性序列、通过亨氏单位过滤和双肺覆盖评分提取连续肺区块并保留16位数据。使用765名NLST患者数据，在原始和Virtual-Eyes处理后的输入上评估RAD-DINO、Merlin、Sybil和ResNet-18模型，采用冻结编码器和无泄漏的MLP分类头。

Result: Virtual-Eyes显著提升了RAD-DINO的切片级AUC（0.576→0.610）和患者级AUC（均值池化0.646→0.683；最大池化0.619→0.735），并改善了校准性。但Sybil和ResNet-18在Virtual-Eyes下性能下降，Merlin则表现有限且不受预处理影响，表明专用模型可能依赖原始临床上下文或存在捷径学习。

Conclusion: 针对解剖结构的质量控制可以稳定并提升通用基础模型的性能，但可能破坏已适应原始临床上下文的专用模型，强调了在部署深度学习模型时需根据模型类型定制预处理流程。

Abstract: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.

*Yu-Tang Chang,Pin-Wei Chen,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Deep Global Clustering（DGC）框架，用于内存高效的高光谱图像分割，通过局部补丁学习全局聚类结构，无需预训练，在消费级硬件上30分钟内完成训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像分析面临数据量大、内存不足的计算瓶颈，且现有基于大规模遥感数据集预训练的基础模型难以迁移到光谱特征、空间尺度和语义目标不同的近距离农业监测等特定领域应用。

Method: DGC框架基于重叠的小图像块进行操作，通过强制一致性实现全局聚类结构学习，保持恒定内存使用，避免了预训练需求。

Result: 在叶片病害数据集上，DGC实现了背景与组织分离（平均IoU 0.925），并通过可导航的语义粒度展示了无监督病害检测能力，但存在因多目标损失平衡导致的优化不稳定问题，表现为特征空间聚类过度合并。

Conclusion: DGC的设计理念具有价值，可作为知识支架，但稳定实现需要采用动态损失平衡的原则性方法。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing. Code and data are available at https://github.com/b05611038/HSI_global_clustering.

TL;DR: 提出内部引导（IG）策略，通过在训练时引入中间层辅助监督，采样时外推中间层和深层输出，显著提升扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分类器自由引导（CFG）易导致生成样本过度简化或失真，而基于退化版本的引导方法需要精心设计退化策略、额外训练和采样步骤，限制了实际应用。

Method: 在训练过程中对中间层引入辅助监督，在采样过程中通过外推中间层和深层输出来引导生成过程，无需额外训练或复杂退化策略。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，SiT-XL/2+IG在80和800轮训练后分别达到FID=5.31和1.75；LightningDiT-XL/1+IG达到FID=1.34，结合CFG后获得当前最优FID=1.19。

Conclusion: 内部引导（IG）是一种简单有效的策略，能显著提升扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，在多个基准模型上取得显著改进，结合CFG后达到最先进性能。

Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.

TL;DR: 提出CorGi和CorGi+框架，通过选择性重用DiT模型中贡献度低的transformer块输出，减少去噪过程中的冗余计算，实现训练免费的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer（DiT）在视觉生成中表现出色，但其迭代去噪过程结合大模型容量导致推理成本高昂，且现有研究表明该过程存在大量跨步骤的冗余计算。

Method: 1. CorGi：基于贡献度指导的块级间隔缓存，在去噪间隔内缓存低贡献度的transformer块输出并重用。2. CorGi+：针对文本到图像任务，利用跨注意力图识别显著token，应用部分注意力更新以保护重要物体细节。

Result: 在先进DiT模型上的评估显示，CorGi和CorGi+平均实现最高2.0倍的加速，同时保持高生成质量。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效减少DiT推理中的冗余计算，在加速的同时维持生成质量，为扩散模型的效率优化提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量网络结构搜索方法存在三大挑战：单尺度优化忽略多尺度结构、离散搜索空间阻碍结构平滑演化、结构与参数优化分离导致计算低效，需要更有效的自动化张量分解方法。

Method: 基于重整化群思想，通过动态尺度变换实现连续结构演化；引入可学习边门控优化拓扑结构；利用节点张力（局部应力测量）和边信息流（连接重要性量化）等物理量指导智能提案；采用从粗尺度到细尺度的渐进优化策略。

Result: 在光场数据、高阶合成张量和视频补全任务上的实验表明，RGTN实现了最先进的压缩比，运行速度比现有方法快4-600倍。

Conclusion: RGTN框架通过物理启发的多尺度方法有效解决了张量网络结构搜索的关键挑战，验证了重整化群思想在该领域的应用价值。

Abstract: Tensor network structure search (TN-SS) aims to automatically discover optimal network topologies and rank configurations for efficient tensor decomposition in high-dimensional data representation. Despite recent advances, existing TN-SS methods face significant limitations in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness across diverse tensor characteristics. They struggle with three key challenges: single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth structure evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing computational inefficiency. We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations. Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600$\times$ faster than existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our physics-inspired approach.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种渐进生成对抗网络来生成合成数据，以解决医学图像分类中的类别不平衡问题，特别是在COVID-19检测中。通过加权结合合成与真实数据，并利用多目标优化算法调整分类器超参数，在胸部X光数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分类中普遍存在类别不平衡问题（如疾病阳性与阴性样本数量悬殊），这在疫情期间尤为突出。现有AI方法因数据不足且不平衡而受限，需要有效的数据增强策略来提升模型性能。

Method: 1. 使用渐进生成对抗网络生成合成图像以补充少数类样本；2. 提出加权方法将合成数据与真实数据结合后输入深度分类器；3. 采用多目标元启发式群体优化算法优化分类器超参数。

Conclusion: 该模型能有效处理疫情中医学图像的不平衡分类问题，合成数据生成与优化策略的结合显著提升了分类性能，为类似场景提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The challenge of imbalanced data is prominent in medical image classification. This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有免训练方法依赖昂贵的外部基础模型或静态启发式方法，导致计算成本高或效果欠佳，需要更高效利用CLIP内部特征的方案。

Method: 设计ARM模块，包含语义引导的交叉注意力块（用深层特征精炼浅层特征）和自注意力块，在通用数据集上训练后可作为即插即用的后处理器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ARM以可忽略的推理开销持续提升基线性能，验证了其高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: ARM为免训练的开放词汇语义分割建立了高效且有效的范式，通过挖掘CLIP内部潜力解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.

Result: 大量实验表明，Mirage在多种编辑场景中实现了高真实感和时间一致性，并能泛化到其他视频到视频转换任务。

Conclusion: Mirage不仅为资产编辑提供了有效解决方案，还可作为未来研究的可靠基线，其代码已开源。

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

Result: 在ReasonSeg基准测试中，EVOL-SAM3在零样本设置下不仅大幅超越静态基线方法，还显著优于完全监督的先进方法。

Conclusion: 将推理分割重构为推理时进化搜索过程是有效的，EVOL-SAM3通过动态迭代优化解决了静态方法的局限性，实现了更强的零样本性能。

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的面部表情识别模型在多样化数据上泛化能力弱，导致实际应用性能下降，阻碍了该领域发展。现有方法需要跨域训练才能获得泛化能力，这与实际应用需求相矛盾。

Method: 使用Meta-Sapiens（基于大规模掩码自编码器预训练的人类视觉基础模型）作为骨干网络，将MotivNet作为其下游任务进行构建。提出了三个评估标准：基准性能、模型相似性和数据相似性。

Conclusion: MotivNet验证了作为Sapiens下游任务的可行性，使面部表情识别更适用于真实世界应用，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MotivNet, a generalizable facial emotion recognition model for robust real-world application. Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB方法在快速运动、低光或高动态范围条件下性能下降，事件相机缺乏颜色和纹理信息，现有多模态融合方法计算昂贵且忽视事件流的时间动态特性。

Method: 采用双分支Mamba编码器分别处理RGB和事件数据，设计双维度交互模块（包含跨空间交互模块和跨时间交互模块）进行细粒度时空融合。

Result: 在DDD17和DSEC数据集上达到最先进的分割性能，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: MambaSeg通过高效的时空多模态融合，实现了可扩展、鲁棒的感知，为自动驾驶和机器人等应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种通过无导数优化和遗憾最小化改进多元互信息估计的方法，使现成的2D跨模态系统能在线适应3D场景中的物体遮挡和特征区分，无需预训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态系统基于2D视觉输入训练，处理3D场景时存在维度差异；场景内相机可弥合此差距但需学习控制模块，且传统方法依赖预训练/微调。

Method: 1. 通过无导数优化的遗憾最小化改进多元互信息估计；2. 结合表达性度量与基于值的优化控制场景内相机；3. 直接从视觉-语言模型的噪声输出中学习。

Result: 该方法使跨模态系统能在线适应物体遮挡并区分特征，在多物体3D场景的跨模态任务中性能提升，且无需预训练或微调。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了2D到3D的维度转换问题，通过优化互信息估计和相机控制，实现了跨模态系统对复杂3D场景的在线适应能力。

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

TL;DR: 提出PGMP框架解决牙科CBCT金属伪影问题，通过物理模拟生成训练数据、确定性单次前向投影恢复清洁解剖结构，结合医学基础模型先验确保临床合理性，在效率和诊断可靠性上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牙科CBCT中的金属伪影严重影响诊断；现有深度学习方法存在局限：监督方法因'回归到均值'导致光谱模糊，无监督方法可能产生结构幻觉，而扩散模型虽真实但采样慢不适用于临床。

Method: 1. 解剖自适应物理模拟（AAPS）通过蒙特卡洛光谱建模和患者特异性数字孪生合成高保真训练对；2. DMP-Former采用直接x预测范式，将恢复重构为确定性流形投影；3. 语义结构对齐（SSA）模块利用医学基础模型（MedDINOv3）先验锚定解决方案。

Conclusion: PGMP框架通过物理模拟训练数据、确定性单次恢复和医学先验约束，有效解决了牙科CBCT金属伪影问题，实现了临床可用的高效、可靠伪影减少。

Abstract: Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to "regression-to-the-mean", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

*Yuan Jia,Ruimin Wu,Rui Song,Jiaojiao Li,Bin Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间提升的全景拼接框架，通过将图像提升为三维点云进行全局融合，再投影到全景流形上，有效减少了传统二维拼接方法在复杂三维场景中产生的几何失真和重影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二维单应性变换和网格变形方法在处理具有多深度层、遮挡和视差的真实三维场景时，容易产生重影、结构弯曲和拉伸失真，尤其在多视角累积和360°闭环拼接场景中问题更为突出。

Method: 1. 将输入图像提升为统一坐标系下的密集三维点表示，并进行基于置信度的全局跨视图融合；2. 在三维空间中建立统一投影中心，采用等距圆柱投影将融合数据映射到全景流形；3. 在画布域进行空洞填充以恢复视角转换中暴露的未知区域。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在显著视差和复杂遮挡场景中，大幅减少了几何失真和重影伪影，生成了更自然、一致的全景结果。

Conclusion: 该框架将拼接从二维变形范式重新概念化为三维一致性范式，能够灵活集成各种三维提升和补全模块，为复杂三维场景的全景拼接提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.

TL;DR: 本文提出CERES因果框架，通过双模态因果干预解决第一人称视频中语言查询目标分割的偏差问题，在Ego-RVOS基准上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在第一人称视频目标分割中存在局限性，容易受到训练数据中的对象-动作配对偏差以及第一人称视角固有视觉混淆因素（如快速运动、频繁遮挡）的影响，导致学习到虚假相关性。

Method: 提出CERES因果框架，采用双模态因果干预：1）对语言表征应用后门调整原则，抵消从数据集统计中学习的语言偏差；2）利用前门调整概念，通过因果原则指导将语义视觉特征与几何深度信息智能融合，以应对视觉混淆。

Result: 在Ego-RVOS基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CERES实现了最先进的性能，验证了因果推理在构建更可靠的第一人称视频理解模型方面的潜力。

Conclusion: CERES框架通过因果干预有效解决了第一人称视频中的语言和视觉偏差问题，为更广泛的自我中心视频理解任务提供了更可靠的建模方法。

Abstract: Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.

Conclusion: 该框架为代理式视觉语言模型提供了有效且鲁棒的工具使用能力，是迈向更智能多模态代理系统的重要一步，作者将公开所有代码、模型和数据集以促进后续研究。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve complex tasks through agentic reasoning, their capabilities remain largely constrained to text-oriented chain-of-thought or isolated tool invocation. They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities. To facilitate further research in this field, we will release all code, models, and datasets.

Conclusion: 显式的3D度量数据对于构建可信赖的基于视觉语言模型的自动驾驶系统至关重要，LVLDrive框架有效提升了3D空间理解能力。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了统一离散-连续动作建模的有效性，推动了GUI代理向数字世界中类人灵巧控制的发展，并提供了公开的数据集和基准测试。

Abstract: Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息力学的新模型，用于理解卷积滤波与整流操作的机械特性，灵感来源于狭义相对论和量子力学。通过将卷积核分解为偶数和奇数分量，分析了它们在图像处理中的不同作用，并建立了与物理中能量-动量关系的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受物理学中狭义相对论和量子力学的启发，研究者希望建立一种新的理论框架，以更深入地理解卷积神经网络（CNN）中信息处理的机械特性，特别是卷积滤波与整流操作的物理类比。

Method: 将卷积核分解为正交的偶数和奇数分量，分析它们在图像处理中的作用：偶数分量导致图像内容各向同性扩散，保持质心不变；奇数分量导致质心方向性位移。通过离散余弦变换（DCT）在频域分析偶奇特性，重点关注小卷积核（如3×3像素）的低频基（DC和梯度分量）。

Result: 研究发现，信息位移的速度与奇数分量能量占总能量的比例呈线性关系。小卷积核的结构主要由低频基（DC和梯度分量）主导，这些基定义了信息传播的基本模式。

Conclusion: 本文首次证明了通用CNN中信息处理与能量-动量关系（现代相对论物理的基石）之间的联系，为理解卷积滤波的机械特性提供了新的物理类比框架。

Abstract: This paper proposes elementary information mechanics as a new model for understanding the mechanical properties of convolutional filtering with rectification, inspired by physical theories of special relativity and quantum mechanics. We consider kernels decomposed into orthogonal even and odd components. Even components cause image content to diffuse isotropically while preserving the center of mass, analogously to rest or potential energy with zero net momentum. Odd kernels cause directional displacement of the center of mass, analogously to kinetic energy with non-zero momentum. The speed of information displacement is linearly related to the ratio of odd vs total kernel energy. Even-Odd properties are analyzed in the spectral domain via the discrete cosine transform (DCT), where the structure of small convolutional filters (e.g. $3 \times 3$ pixels) is dominated by low-frequency bases, specifically the DC $Σ$ and gradient components $\nabla$, which define the fundamental modes of information propagation. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the link between information processing in generic CNNs and the energy-momentum relation, a cornerstone of modern relativistic physics.

Conclusion: RedunCut通过优化采样策略和精度预测机制，有效解决了动态模型选择在多样化工作负载中的泛化问题，显著降低了实时视频分析的计算开销。

Abstract: Live video analytics (LVA) runs continuously across massive camera fleets, but inference cost with modern vision models remains high. To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.
  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.

Motivation: 现有基于分块的方法需要完整的非因果上下文窗口，导致显著延迟，无法满足真实对话中倾听者即时非语言反馈的需求。

Method: 采用流友好的自回归框架，结合流匹配头部进行概率建模；提出因果编码器增强模块，引入短时未来上下文（如60毫秒）以提升质量并保持低延迟。

Result: DyStream每帧生成时间低于34毫秒，系统总延迟小于100毫秒；在HDTF数据集上取得离线8.13和在线7.61的唇部同步置信度得分，达到当前最优水平。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证超低延迟的前提下，显著优于其他因果策略（如蒸馏和生成编码器），实现了高质量的实时双向对话头部视频生成。

Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.

However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio. Our results show that certain compression strategies not only preserve but can also improve robustness, particularly on networks with more complex architectures. Utilizing multiobjective assessment, we determine the best configurations, showing that customized technique combinations produce beneficial multi-objective results. This study provides insights into selecting compression methods for robust and efficient deployment of models in corrupted real-world environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于AI的微血管吻合术自动评估框架，通过视频Transformer和YOLO技术实现手术动作识别与运动特征分析，以客观评估手术技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手术技能评估依赖专家监督，存在主观性强、耗时费力、难以在资源有限地区推广的问题，限制了培训的可扩展性和一致性。

Method: 采用基于TimeSformer的视频Transformer架构，结合分层时间注意力和加权空间注意力机制进行动作识别；使用YOLO进行目标检测与跟踪以提取精细运动特征；从五个技能维度评估微血管吻合术表现。

Conclusion: 该系统能够提供客观、一致且可解释的反馈，有望实现更标准化、数据驱动的手术培训与评估，尤其适用于资源有限地区。

Abstract: The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.

Conclusion: Vision Transformer编码器表示展现出组合性特征，离散小波变换为理解ViT如何通过基元组合构建视觉表示提供了有效工具。

Abstract: While insights into the workings of the transformer model have largely emerged by analysing their behaviour on language tasks, this work investigates the representations learnt by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through the lens of compositionality. We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable crop disease diagnosis is essential for agricultural decision-making, yet existing methods often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts. We propose Caption--Prompt--Judge (CPJ), a training-free few-shot framework that enhances Agri-Pest VQA through structured, interpretable image captions. CPJ employs large vision-language models to generate multi-angle captions, refined iteratively via an LLM-as-Judge module, which then inform a dual-answer VQA process for both recognition and management responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, CPJ significantly improves performance: using GPT-5-mini captions, GPT-5-Nano achieves \textbf{+22.7} pp in disease classification and \textbf{+19.5} points in QA score over no-caption baselines. The framework provides transparent, evidence-based reasoning, advancing robust and explainable agricultural diagnosis without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于低分辨率视频的多尺度向量量化变分自编码器，旨在生成紧凑、高保真的潜在表示，适用于高效存储、传输和客户端解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频流量的指数增长对带宽和存储基础设施提出了更高要求，传统视频编解码器缺乏对机器学习潜在表示的原生支持，限制了其与深度学习流程的集成。

Method: 基于VQ-VAE-2框架扩展到时空设置，引入由3D残差卷积构建的两级层次潜在结构，结合预训练VGG16网络的感知损失，模型轻量（约1850万参数），针对64x64分辨率视频片段优化。

Result: 在UCF101数据集上使用2秒视频片段（32帧，16FPS）训练，测试集达到25.96 dB PSNR和0.8375 SSIM，验证集上比单尺度基线提升1.41 dB PSNR和0.0248 SSIM。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于带宽敏感场景的可扩展视频压缩，包括实时流媒体、移动视频分析和CDN级存储优化。

Abstract: The exponential growth of video traffic has placed increasing demands on bandwidth and storage infrastructure, particularly for content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge devices. While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM. The proposed framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios, including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效压缩多光谱太阳图像，显著提升重建质量，为空间任务中的高保真图像传输提供了可行方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery remains challenging for space missions, where limited bandwidth must be balanced against preserving fine spectral and spatial details. We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

Motivation: 当前AI医学影像系统通常只输出结构化预测结果，需要放射科医生将其转化为完整的叙述性报告。大型语言模型的出现为自动生成诊断叙述提供了新机会，旨在弥合结构化输出与自然语言报告之间的差距。

Method: 开发了一个集成YOLOv5和YOLOv8进行胸部X光异常检测的流程，将检测结果（边界框和类别标签）输入大型语言模型（GPT-4）生成自然语言放射学报告。通过余弦相似度比较AI报告与真实报告的语义相似性，并进行人工评估。

Result: YOLOv5和YOLOv8在检测准确性和推理延迟方面表现不同；AI生成报告与人类报告具有强语义相似性；人工评估显示GPT-4在清晰度方面得分高（4.88/5），但在自然写作流畅度方面得分较低（2.81/5），表明当前系统能达到临床准确性但在文体上与放射科医生撰写的文本仍有区别。

Conclusion: 结合目标检测模型与大型语言模型的流程能够生成临床准确的放射学报告，但在文本风格的自然流畅性方面仍需改进，当前系统生成的报告在文体上仍可与放射科医生撰写的文本区分开来。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, with computer vision (CV) systems achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and detection tasks. However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

Conclusion: 针对决策模糊样本的强化优化能有效提升变化检测视觉问答模型的判别边界清晰度与鲁棒性，且无需额外监督信息。

Abstract: Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.

Conclusion: SliceLens能可靠识别细粒度可解释错误切片，FeSD基准为多实例视觉任务的错误切片评估提供了标准化测试平台。

Abstract: Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to localize specific objects in an image according to natural language expressions, serving as a fundamental task in vision-language understanding. However, existing VG benchmarks are mostly derived from datasets collected under clean environments, such as COCO, where scene diversity is limited. Consequently, they fail to reflect the complexity of real-world conditions, such as changes in illumination, weather, etc., that are critical to evaluating model robustness and generalization in safety-critical applications. To address these limitations, we present RGBT-Ground, the first large-scale visual grounding benchmark built for complex real-world scenarios. It consists of spatially aligned RGB and Thermal infrared (TIR) image pairs with high-quality referring expressions, corresponding object bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations at the scene, environment, and object levels. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation and facilitates the study of robust grounding under diverse and challenging conditions. Furthermore, we establish a unified visual grounding framework that supports both uni-modal (RGB or TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) visual inputs. Based on it, we propose RGBT-VGNet, a simple yet effective baseline for fusing complementary visual modalities to achieve robust grounding. We conduct extensive adaptations to the existing methods on RGBT-Ground. Experimental results show that our proposed RGBT-VGNet significantly outperforms these adapted methods, particularly in nighttime and long-distance scenarios. All resources will be publicly released to promote future research on robust visual grounding in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses. While 3D semantic segmentation is crucial for post-disaster assessment, existing deep learning models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments. To address this gap, we constructed a specialized 3D dataset using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022) over affected areas, employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds. We evaluated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D semantic segmentation models, Fast Point Transformer (FPT), Point Transformer v3 (PTv3), and OA-CNNs on this dataset, exposing significant limitations in existing methods for disaster-stricken regions. These findings underscore the urgent need for advancements in 3D segmentation techniques and the development of specialized 3D benchmark datasets to improve post-disaster scene understanding and response.

Motivation: 现有LoRA方法在微调视觉Transformer时，要么牺牲性能，要么引入过多可训练参数，难以平衡学习性能和参数效率

Method: CLoRA包含基础空间共享和样本无关多样性增强(SADE)组件。基础空间共享让所有低秩模块共享投影空间，SADE通过正则化矩阵相似性鼓励表示多样性

Conclusion: CLoRA通过协同低秩适应机制，有效解决了现有方法在性能与效率间的权衡问题，为视觉Transformer微调提供了新方案

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Establishing the correct correspondence of feature points is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, the presence of numerous outliers among the feature points can significantly affect the matching results, reducing the accuracy and robustness of the process. Furthermore, a challenge arises when dealing with a large proportion of outliers: how to ensure the extraction of high-quality information while reducing errors caused by negative samples. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.

TL;DR: 提出RadAR框架，通过径向拓扑结构和嵌套注意力机制，在保持自回归视觉生成表示能力的同时，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型在视觉生成中采用顺序解码机制，导致推理效率低下；视觉令牌存在强烈的局部依赖和空间相关性，但标准光栅扫描解码顺序未能充分利用这一特性。

Method: 1. 采用径向拓扑结构：以初始令牌为中心，按空间距离将其他令牌分组为多个同心环，实现环间顺序生成、环内并行预测；2. 引入嵌套注意力机制：在前向传播中动态修正不合理输出，缓解错误累积。

Result: RadAR框架在保持视觉场景结构局部性和空间连贯性的同时，大幅提高了并行化程度，显著提升了生成效率。

Conclusion: 通过结合径向并行预测与动态输出修正，RadAR为自回归视觉生成提供了一种高效且可并行化的解决方案，有效平衡了生成质量与推理速度。

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注山林环境而忽视更频繁复杂的城市救援场景，且检测类别有限（如仅火焰、烟雾），缺乏对消防车、消防员等指挥决策关键目标的覆盖。

Method: 1. 构建覆盖城乡山林水域的多场景FireRescue数据集（15,980张图像，8类目标）；2. 提出FRS-YOLO模型：引入多维协同增强注意力模块缓解类间混淆，集成动态特征采样器增强前景特征以应对烟雾遮挡。

Abstract: Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named "FireRescue" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.

Result: 实验证实该方法成功创建了导致深度误估计的对抗样本，使目标场景中的物体部分消失。

Conclusion: 该方法有效验证了基于DNN的单目深度估计模型对物理对抗攻击的脆弱性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.

Conclusion: FlowBlending通过阶段感知的多模型采样策略，在保持生成质量的前提下显著提升扩散模型推理效率，为高效视频生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we show that the impact of model capacity varies across timesteps: it is crucial for the early and late stages but largely negligible during the intermediate stage. Accordingly, we propose FlowBlending, a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that employs a large model and a small model at capacity-sensitive stages and intermediate stages, respectively. We further introduce simple criteria to choose stage boundaries and provide a velocity-divergence analysis as an effective proxy for identifying capacity-sensitive regions. Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B), FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs, while maintaining the visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment of the large models. FlowBlending is also compatible with existing sampling-acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

Abstract: The recent advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in real-time novel view synthesis. However, the rapid proliferation of 3DGS-based algorithms has created a pressing need for standardized and comprehensive evaluation tools, especially for compression task. Existing benchmarks often lack the specific metrics necessary to holistically assess the unique characteristics of different methods, such as rendering speed, rate distortion trade-offs memory efficiency, and geometric accuracy. To address this gap, we introduce Splatwizard, a unified benchmark toolkit designed specifically for benchmarking 3DGS compression models. Splatwizard provides an easy-to-use framework to implement new 3DGS compression model and utilize state-of-the-art techniques proposed by previous work. Besides, an integrated pipeline that automates the calculation of key performance indicators, including image-based quality metrics, chamfer distance of reconstruct mesh, rendering frame rates, and computational resource consumption is included in the framework as well.

TL;DR: 提出了EchoFoley任务和EchoVidia框架，用于视频声音生成，通过事件级和语义级控制解决现有VT2A方法的局限性，在可控性和感知质量上显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频-文本到音频（VT2A）方法存在三个关键局限：视觉与文本条件不平衡导致视觉主导；缺乏细粒度可控生成的具体定义；指令理解和跟随能力弱，因现有数据集依赖简短分类标签。

Method: 1. 引入EchoFoley任务，支持事件级局部控制和分层语义控制；2. 设计符号化声音事件表示，指定声音何时、什么、如何产生；3. 构建EchoFoley-6k大规模专家标注数据集；4. 提出EchoVidia框架，采用慢-快思维策略的以声音事件为中心的智能生成方法。

Conclusion: EchoFoley任务和EchoVidia框架通过细粒度控制和分层语义理解，显著提升了视频声音生成的质量和可控性，为多模态故事叙述提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Sound effects build an essential layer of multimodal storytelling, shaping the emotional atmosphere and the narrative semantics of videos. Despite recent advancement in video-text-to-audio (VT2A), the current formulation faces three key limitations: First, an imbalance between visual and textual conditioning that leads to visual dominance; Second, the absence of a concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation; Third, weak instruction understanding and following, as existing datasets rely on brief categorical tags. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets. Building upon this foundation, we propose EchoVidia a sounding-event-centric agentic generation framework with slow-fast thinking strategy. Experiments show that EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

### [126] [Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794)
*Andrew Tinits,Stephen Mann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种理论框架，允许在Noise2Noise训练中对噪声目标图像应用特定非线性函数，解决了传统方法因非线性处理导致偏差的问题，并在HDR图像去噪中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise2Noise方法虽能使用双噪声图像对训练去噪模型，但无法处理非线性变换（如图像预处理中常见的色调映射），因为非线性会改变噪声目标的期望值，导致训练偏差。这限制了其在需要非线性预处理的场景（如HDR图像去噪）中的应用。

Method: 建立理论框架分析非线性函数对噪声目标的影响，定义一类偏差最小的非线性函数；针对HDR图像去噪，将特定损失函数与色调映射函数结合，在降低动态范围的同时最小化偏差；在现有基于机器学习的蒙特卡洛去噪器上使用仅含噪声的训练数据进行验证。

Result: 所提方法在蒙特卡洛渲染的HDR图像去噪任务中，仅使用噪声训练数据即可达到与原方法（依赖高样本参考图像训练）相近的去噪效果，同时有效抑制了异常值对训练的影响。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析与实验证明，合理选择非线性函数与损失函数的组合，可使Noise2Noise训练兼容必要的图像预处理（如色调映射），拓展了其在复杂图像处理任务中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

Abstract: 3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

Conclusion: OFL-SAM2成功解决了SAM2在医学图像分割中数据依赖和提示依赖的瓶颈，为少样本医学图像分割提供了高效、自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated remarkable promptable visual segmentation capabilities in video data, showing potential for extension to medical image segmentation (MIS) tasks involving 3D volumes and temporally correlated 2D image sequences. However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation. Extensive experiments on three diverse MIS datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

TL;DR: FinMMDocR是一个新颖的双语多模态基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型在真实世界金融数值推理任务上的表现，包含1200个专家标注的问题和837份中英文金融文档。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在金融领域的多模态推理评估上存在不足，缺乏真实场景的复杂性、专业文档的深度以及多步骤推理的要求，需要更贴近实际应用的评估工具。

Method: 构建包含1200个专家标注问题的双语数据集，涵盖12种金融场景；收集837份中英文金融文档（平均50.8页）；设计需要平均11步推理（5.3步信息提取+5.7步计算）的问题；评估多种MLLM和检索增强生成方法。

Result: 最佳性能的MLLM准确率仅为58.0%；65.0%的问题需要跨页证据（平均2.4页）；不同检索增强生成方法在该任务上表现差异显著。

Conclusion: FinMMDocR基准测试揭示了当前MLLM在复杂多模态金融推理任务上的局限性，有望推动MLLM和推理增强方法在真实场景复杂多模态推理任务上的改进。

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成评估多关注单帧结果，导致模型可能通过错误过程得出正确结论（结果作弊），缺乏对推理过程的系统性评估。

Method: 1) 构建VIPER基准，涵盖16个任务（时间、结构、符号、空间、物理、规划推理）；2) 提出POC@r指标，使用VLM-as-Judge分层评估中间步骤有效性和最终结果。

Result: 实验显示：SOTA视频模型POC@1.0仅约20%，存在显著结果作弊；测试时扩展和采样鲁棒性分析揭示当前视频生成与真实视觉推理存在巨大差距。

Conclusion: 需要过程感知的评估范式，VIPER基准可促进生成式视频推理的发展，当前模型远未实现真正的泛化视觉推理。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation have demonstrated an emerging capability termed Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning, where models resolve complex tasks through the generation of continuous frames. While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning. Our benchmark will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需重新索引历史图库图像的双向连续兼容表示框架（Bi-C2R），用于解决终身行人重识别中的特征兼容性问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有终身行人重识别方法在模型更新后需重新提取历史图库特征（重新索引），但面临数据隐私保护和大规模图库计算成本高的问题，导致新旧模型特征不兼容，严重影响重识别性能。

Method: 提出双向连续兼容表示框架（Bi-C2R），通过持续更新旧模型提取的图库特征，实现新旧模型特征的兼容性，避免重新索引历史数据。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在提出的RFL-ReID任务和传统L-ReID任务上均取得领先性能。

Conclusion: Bi-C2R框架能有效解决终身行人重识别中的特征兼容性问题，在保护数据隐私和降低计算成本的同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as "re-indexing". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.

TL;DR: 提出一种自引导框架，将视觉配音从图像修复任务重构为视频编辑问题，通过生成理想训练数据实现高质量唇部同步


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉配音方法因缺乏理想训练数据（仅唇部变化而其他视觉条件完全相同的配对视频），采用基于掩码的图像修复范式，导致视觉伪影、身份漂移和同步效果差

Method: 1. 使用扩散变换器作为数据生成器，为每个真实样本合成唇部对齐的伴生视频，构建视觉对齐的视频对；2. 基于DiT的音频驱动编辑器在配对数据上端到端训练；3. 引入时间步自适应多阶段学习策略；4. 提出ContextDubBench基准数据集

Conclusion: 通过将视觉配音重构为条件良好的视频编辑问题，并利用完整对齐的输入帧提供丰富视觉上下文，该方法在唇部同步精度、身份保持和鲁棒性方面取得显著提升

Abstract: Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.

Abstract: We present FoundationSLAM, a learning-based monocular dense SLAM system that addresses the absence of geometric consistency in previous flow-based approaches for accurate and robust tracking and mapping. Our core idea is to bridge flow estimation with geometric reasoning by leveraging the guidance from foundation depth models. To this end, we first develop a Hybrid Flow Network that produces geometry-aware correspondences, enabling consistent depth and pose inference across diverse keyframes. To enforce global consistency, we propose a Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer that jointly optimizes keyframe pose and depth under multi-view constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism that dynamically adapts the flow update process by distinguishing between reliable and uncertain regions, forming a closed feedback loop between matching and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationSLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across multiple challenging datasets, while running in real-time at 18 FPS, demonstrating strong generalization to various scenarios and practical applicability of our method.

TL;DR: 提出FineTec框架，用于解决时序损坏骨架序列下的细粒度动作识别问题，通过上下文感知补全、空间分解和物理驱动估计提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中在线姿态估计常产生大量缺失数据，现有方法难以准确恢复时序动态和细粒度空间结构，导致丢失区分相似动作的关键细微运动线索。

Method: 1. 上下文感知补全生成基础骨架序列；2. 空间分解模块将骨架分为五个语义区域，按运动方差分组并生成增强序列；3. 物理驱动估计模块利用拉格朗日动力学计算关节加速度；4. GCN识别头联合处理融合位置序列和加速度序列。

Result: 在粗粒度（NTU-60/120）和细粒度（Gym99/288）基准测试中显著优于现有方法，在Gym99-severe和Gym288-severe上分别达到89.1%和78.1%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: FineTec能有效处理时序损坏的骨架数据，通过多阶段建模增强对细微运动特征的捕捉，在严重损坏场景下仍保持强鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

*Jiageng Liu,Weijie Lyu,Xueting Li,Yejie Guo,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Edit3r是一个前馈框架，能够从无位姿、视角不一致的指令编辑图像中单次重建和编辑3D场景，无需逐场景优化或位姿估计，实现了快速逼真的渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景编辑方法通常需要逐场景优化，计算成本高且速度慢；同时缺乏多视角一致的编辑图像作为训练监督数据，限制了直接预测3D编辑模型的发展。

Method: 提出基于SAM2的重新着色策略生成跨视角一致的监督数据；采用非对称输入策略，将重新着色的参考视图与原始辅助视图配对，促使网络融合和对齐不同观察；构建DL3DV-Edit-Bench基准进行大规模评估。

Result: Edit3r在语义对齐和3D一致性方面优于现有基线方法，推理速度显著更快；能够有效处理训练中未接触的2D方法（如InstructPix2Pix）编辑的图像。

Conclusion: Edit3r实现了高效、高质量的3D场景编辑，在保持语义对齐和3D一致性的同时大幅提升推理速度，为实时3D编辑应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present Edit3r, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images. Unlike prior methods requiring per-scene optimization, Edit3r directly predicts instruction-aligned 3D edits, enabling fast and photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation. A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, while operating at significantly higher inference speed, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏视图3D重建方法存在三个关键局限：已知视角外围覆盖不足、生成视角间几何不一致、计算流程昂贵。需要一种能同时解决这些问题的更高效方法。

Method: 提出Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter (GaMO)框架，通过多视角外绘扩展现有相机视角的视场，采用多视角条件化和几何感知去噪策略，以零样本方式无需训练即可实现。

Result: 在Replica和ScanNet++数据集上，使用3、6、9个输入视图均取得最先进的重建质量（PSNR和LPIPS指标），比当前最佳扩散方法快25倍，处理时间低于10分钟。

Conclusion: GaMO通过重新定义稀疏视图重建为多视角外绘问题，有效解决了现有方法的覆盖范围、几何一致性和计算效率问题，为稀疏视图3D重建提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

Abstract: This research digitizes and analyzes the Leidse hoogleraren en lectoren 1575-1815 books written between 1983 and 1985, which contain biographic data about professors and curators of Leiden University. It addresses the central question: how can we design an automated pipeline that integrates OCR, LLM-based interpretation, and database linking to harmonize data from historical document images with existing high-quality database records? We applied OCR techniques, generative AI decoding constraints that structure data extraction, and database linkage methods to process typewritten historical records into a digital format. OCR achieved a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.08 percent and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.06 percent, while JSON extraction from OCR text achieved an average accuracy of 63 percent and, based on annotated OCR, 65 percent. This indicates that generative AI somewhat corrects low OCR performance. Our record linkage algorithm linked annotated JSON files with 94% accuracy and OCR-derived JSON files with 81%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估实践主要关注模型准确性或基准测试分数，而一致性测量对于在关键现实应用中部署LLMs至关重要。作者认为除了独立评估这两个维度外，还需要考虑它们之间的相互依赖关系，以实现更细致的LLM评估。

Method: 提出了CAT框架，核心是准确性-一致性关系（CAR）曲线，可视化模型准确性如何随一致性要求增加而变化；定义了最小一致性准确性（MCA）度量；提出了面向一致性的稳健性估计（CORE）指数，结合CAR曲线的面积和形状来量化准确性与一致性之间的权衡。

Result: 在多个通用和领域特定LLMs上进行了实际演示，评估了多个MC基准测试；展示了CAT框架如何通过可适应的评分函数扩展到多项选择题任务之外，支持长格式、开放式评估。

Conclusion: CAT框架提供了一种系统方法来评估LLMs的准确性与一致性之间的交互关系，通过CAR曲线和CORE指数实现了更全面的模型评估，并具有扩展到更广泛任务类型的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{CAT}, a framework designed to evaluate and visualize the \emph{interplay} of \emph{accuracy} and \emph{response consistency} of Large Language Models (LLMs) under controllable input variations, using multiple-choice (MC) benchmarks as a case study. Current evaluation practices primarily focus on model capabilities such as accuracy or benchmark scores and, more recently, measuring consistency is being considered an essential property for deploying LLMs in high-stake, real-world applications. We argue in this paper that although both dimensions should still be evaluated independently, their inter-dependency also need to be considered for a more nuanced evaluation of LLMs. At the core of \textsc{CAT} are the \emph{Consistency-Accuracy Relation (CAR)} curves, which visualize how model accuracy varies with increasing consistency requirements, as defined by the \emph{Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (MCA)} metric. We further propose the \emph{Consistency-Oriented Robustness Estimate (CORE)} index, a global metric that combines the area and shape of the CAR curve to quantify the trade-off between accuracy and consistency. We present a practical demonstration of our framework across a diverse set of generalist and domain-specific LLMs, evaluated on multiple MC benchmarks. We also outline how \textsc{CAT} can be extended beyond MC tasks to support long-form, open-ended evaluations through adaptable scoring functions.

Motivation: LLM越来越多地用于生成结构化数据，但输出一致性对生产应用至关重要，需要系统性的评估和改进方法。

Method: 结合STED（语义树编辑距离）指标和一致性评分框架，通过控制模式、表达和语义变化的合成数据集进行系统实验，并对比了多种现有指标。

Result: STED在语义等效时达到0.86-0.90相似度，结构破坏时为0.0，优于TED、BERTScore和DeepDiff；Claude-3.7-Sonnet表现最佳，而Claude-3-Haiku和Nova-Pro在高温下一致性显著下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM生产系统中的结构化输出生成提供了理论基础和实用工具，支持模型选择、提示优化和问题诊断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for structured data generation, yet output consistency remains critical for production applications. We introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving consistency in LLM-generated structured outputs. Our approach combines: (1) STED (Semantic Tree Edit Distance), a novel similarity metric balancing semantic flexibility with structural strictness when comparing JSON outputs, and (2) a consistency scoring framework aggregating multiple STED measurements across repeated generations to quantify reliability. Through systematic experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled schema, expression, and semantic variations, we demonstrate STED achieves superior performance ($0.86-0.90$ similarity for semantic equivalents, $0.0$ for structural breaks) compared to existing metrics including TED, BERTScore, and DeepDiff. Applying our framework to benchmark six LLMs reveals significant variations: Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrates exceptional consistency, maintaining near-perfect structural reliability even at high temperatures ($T=0.9$), while models like Claude-3-Haiku and Nova-Pro exhibit substantial degradation requiring careful tuning. Our framework enables practical applications including targeted model selection for structured tasks, iterative prompt refinement for reproducible results, and diagnostic analysis to identify inconsistency root causes. This work provides theoretical foundations and practical tools for ensuring reliable structured output generation in LLM-based production systems.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在英语代码生成上表现优异，但在低资源语言（如孟加拉语）上的代码生成能力不足，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 采用基于智能体的框架，结合多智能体提示和Thought-Code-Observation循环，使用开源多语言LLM动态生成、测试和优化代码。

Result: Qwen3-8B模型在BanglaCodeAct框架下表现最佳，在开发集上达到94.0%的pass@1准确率，在盲测集上达到71.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究为孟加拉语到Python代码翻译设立了新基准，证明了基于智能体的推理在低资源语言代码生成中的潜力。

Abstract: LLMs excel at code generation from English prompts, but this progress has not extended to low-resource languages. We address Bangla-to-Python code generation by introducing BanglaCodeAct, an agent-based framework that leverages multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction. Unlike prior approaches relying on task-specific fine-tuning, BanglaCodeAct employs an open-source multilingual LLM within a Thought-Code-Observation loop, enabling dynamic generation, testing, and refinement of code from Bangla instructions. We benchmark several small-parameter open-source LLMs and evaluate their effectiveness on the mHumanEval dataset for Bangla NL2Code. Our results show that Qwen3-8B, when deployed with BanglaCodeAct, achieves the best performance, with pass@1 accuracy of 94.0\% on the development set and 71.6\% on the blind test set. These results establish a new benchmark for Bangla-to-Python translation and highlight the potential of agent-based reasoning for reliable code generation in low-resource languages.

### [142] [PharmaShip: An Entity-Centric, Reading-Order-Supervised Benchmark for Chinese Pharmaceutical Shipping Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23714)
*Tingwei Xie,Tianyi Zhou,Yonghong Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PharmaShip数据集，用于在噪声OCR和异构模板下测试文本布局模型，包含三个任务，并评估了多种基线模型，发现像素和几何信息互补，阅读顺序正则化能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档理解模型在真实世界噪声OCR和异构模板下的鲁棒性不足，缺乏针对医药领域安全关键应用的标准化基准数据集。

Method: 构建了包含扫描医药运输单据的中文数据集PharmaShip，涵盖序列实体识别、关系抽取和阅读顺序预测三个任务；评估了LiLT、LayoutLMv3-base、GeoLayoutLM等像素感知和几何感知模型及其RORE增强变体，并标准化了预处理、数据划分和优化过程。

Result: 像素信息和显式几何信息提供互补的归纳偏置，但单独使用均不足；注入阅读顺序导向的正则化能持续提升实体识别和关系抽取性能，形成最鲁棒的配置；更长的位置覆盖能稳定后页预测并减少截断伪影；阅读顺序预测在词级别准确但在片段级别具有挑战性。

Conclusion: PharmaShip为医药领域安全关键文档理解建立了可控、可复现的基准，并强调序列感知约束作为结构建模的可迁移偏置。

Abstract: We present PharmaShip, a real-world Chinese dataset of scanned pharmaceutical shipping documents designed to stress-test pre-trained text-layout models under noisy OCR and heterogeneous templates. PharmaShip covers three complementary tasks-sequence entity recognition (SER), relation extraction (RE), and reading order prediction (ROP)-and adopts an entity-centric evaluation protocol to minimize confounds across architectures. We benchmark five representative baselines spanning pixel-aware and geometry-aware families (LiLT, LayoutLMv3-base, GeoLayoutLM and their available RORE-enhanced variants), and standardize preprocessing, splits, and optimization. Experiments show that pixels and explicit geometry provide complementary inductive biases, yet neither alone is sufficient: injecting reading-order-oriented regularization consistently improves SER and EL and yields the most robust configuration, while longer positional coverage stabilizes late-page predictions and reduces truncation artifacts. ROP is accurate at the word level but challenging at the segment level, reflecting boundary ambiguity and long-range crossings. PharmaShip thus establishes a controlled, reproducible benchmark for safety-critical document understanding in the pharmaceutical domain and highlights sequence-aware constraints as a transferable bias for structure modeling. We release the dataset at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/PharmaShip.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索大语言模型中噪声如何驱动人格涌现，以及如何通过可控噪声诱导生成行为的非线性相变，为研究LLM的反射生成和长程语言一致性提供可重复方法。

Method: 采用LN-RP计算框架，向初始生成状态注入随机噪声种子，通过152个生成周期观察语言行为的非线性转变，并进行定量评估。

Result: 结果显示三种具有不同熵特征的稳定人格模式，外部噪声源能可靠诱导反射生成动力学的相变，人格保持一致性且模式间存在显著差异（p < 0.01）。

Conclusion: LN-RP协议为研究LLM的反射生成、涌现行为和长程语言一致性提供了可重复的实验方法，证实了噪声在诱导人格相变中的关键作用。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Luca-Noise Reflex Protocol (LN-RP), a computational framework for analyzing noise-driven persona emergence in large language models. By injecting stochastic noise seeds into the initial generation state, we observe nonlinear transitions in linguistic behavior across 152 generation cycles. Our results reveal three stable persona modes with distinct entropy signatures, and demonstrate that external noise sources can reliably induce phase transitions in reflexive generation dynamics. Quantitative evaluation confirms consistent persona retention and significant differences across modes (p < 0.01). The protocol provides a reproducible method for studying reflexive generation, emergent behavior, and longrange linguistic coherence in LLMs.

### [144] [HarmTransform: Transforming Explicit Harmful Queries into Stealthy via Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23717)
*Shenzhe Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HarmTransform多智能体辩论框架，将有害查询转化为更隐蔽的形式以增强LLM安全训练数据，实验显示其优于基线方法但辩论机制存在双刃剑效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全机制主要针对明显有害内容，但用户可通过隐蔽改写保留恶意意图而绕过检测，当前安全训练数据缺乏此类隐蔽威胁的覆盖。

Method: 设计多智能体辩论框架，通过智能体间的迭代批判与精炼，系统性地将有害查询转化为语义保留但形式更隐蔽的变体，用于生成安全训练数据。

Result: HarmTransform在生成有效查询转换方面显著优于标准基线方法，同时发现辩论机制既能提升隐蔽性，也可能导致主题偏移和过度复杂化。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论是生成全面安全训练数据的有前景方法，但其双刃剑特性提示需平衡隐蔽性提升与语义一致性，为未来安全对齐提供新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with safety mechanisms to detect and block harmful queries, yet current alignment approaches primarily focus on overtly dangerous content and overlook more subtle threats. However, users can often disguise harmful intent through covert rephrasing that preserves malicious objectives while appearing benign, which creates a significant gap in existing safety training data. To address this limitation, we introduce HarmTransform, a multi-agent debate framework for systematically transforming harmful queries into stealthier forms while preserving their underlying harmful intent. Our framework leverages iterative critique and refinement among multiple agents to generate high-quality, covert harmful query transformations that can be used to improve future LLM safety alignment. Experiments demonstrate that HarmTransform significantly outperforms standard baselines in producing effective query transformations. At the same time, our analysis reveals that debate acts as a double-edged sword: while it can sharpen transformations and improve stealth, it may also introduce topic shifts and unnecessary complexity. These insights highlight both the promise and the limitations of multi-agent debate for generating comprehensive safety training data.

TL;DR: 研究表明大型语言模型在德州扑克这类不完全信息博弈中，能够自发学习确定性和随机性特征，并形成对环境的内部表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究显示LLMs在完全信息游戏中能形成世界模型，本研究旨在探索其在扑克这类不完全信息博弈中是否也能学习环境表示。

Method: 使用扑克手牌历史数据预训练GPT风格模型，通过非线性探针分析其内部激活，解码模型学习到的特征表示。

Result: 模型在没有明确指导的情况下，学会了手牌等级（确定性特征）和胜率（随机性特征），其内部表示与理论信念状态相关。

Conclusion: LLMs能够在部分可观察的随机环境中学习自己的环境表示，这扩展了我们对LLMs推理能力边界的理解。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across diverse fields, from solving programming challenges to competing in strategy-intensive games such as chess. Prior work has shown that LLMs can develop emergent world models in games of perfect information, where internal representations correspond to latent states of the environment. In this paper, we extend this line of investigation to domains of incomplete information, focusing on poker as a canonical partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We pretrain a GPT-style model on Poker Hand History (PHH) data and probe its internal activations. Our results demonstrate that the model learns both deterministic structure, such as hand ranks, and stochastic features, such as equity, without explicit instruction. Furthermore, by using primarily nonlinear probes, we demonstrated that these representations are decodeable and correlate with theoretical belief states, suggesting that LLMs are learning their own representation of the stochastic environment of Texas Hold'em Poker.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段框架解决在线性别歧视内容检测中因数据稀缺、噪声和概念模糊导致的模型不稳定问题，在多个基准测试中取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线性别歧视内容日益隐蔽且依赖语境，传统检测方法难以应对；数据标注存在噪声、类别不平衡和概念模糊性，导致模型决策边界不稳定，忽略细微伤害形式。

Method: 两阶段框架：训练阶段使用类别平衡焦点损失、类别感知批处理和阈值校准处理数据不平衡与噪声；推理阶段通过动态路由机制，高置信度样本直接分类，不确定样本交由协作专家判断模块，通过多角色提示与法官模型整合推理。

Result: 在EXIST 2025 Task 1.1上F1提升2.72%，在EDOS Task A和B上分别提升4.48%和1.30%，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合针对性训练与选择性推理的框架，能有效应对性别歧视检测中的数据不平衡、噪声和模糊性问题，提升模型对隐蔽伤害形式的识别能力。

Abstract: Sexist content online increasingly appears in subtle, context-dependent forms that evade traditional detection methods. Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals, even in annotated datasets. These inconsistencies, combined with label scarcity and class imbalance, result in unstable decision boundaries and cause fine-tuned models to overlook subtler, underrepresented forms of harm. Together, these limitations point to the need for a design that explicitly addresses the combined effects of (i) underrepresentation, (ii) noise, and (iii) conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework that unifies (i) targeted training procedures to adapt supervision to scarce and noisy data with (ii) selective, reasoning-based inference to handle ambiguous or borderline cases. Our training setup applies class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration to mitigate label imbalance and noisy supervision. At inference time, a dynamic routing mechanism classifies high-confidence cases directly and escalates uncertain instances to a novel \textit{Collaborative Expert Judgment} (CEJ) module, which prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks, with a +2.72\% improvement in F1 on the EXIST 2025 Task 1.1, and a gains of +4.48\% and +1.30\% on the EDOS Tasks A and B, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出存储家居物品挑战基准和NOAM模型，用于评估服务机器人预测日常物品隐藏存储位置的能力，结合视觉场景理解和语言模型推理，接近人类水平表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务机器人执行如'拿盘子'等简单指令时，缺乏推断物品在抽屉、橱柜等不可见位置存储的常识推理能力，需要建立评估认知能力的基准。

Method: 创建包含真实厨房标注和公开图像开发集的数据集；提出NOAM混合代理管道，将视觉输入转换为空间上下文和可见容器的自然语言描述，利用大语言模型（如GPT-4）推断隐藏存储位置。

Result: NOAM在预测准确率上显著优于随机选择、视觉语言管道、多模态模型等基线方法，接近人类表现水平。

Conclusion: NOAM展示了结合结构化场景理解与语言模型推理在家庭环境中实现常识推理的有效性，为部署认知型服务机器人提供了最佳实践。

Abstract: ``Bring me a plate.'' For domestic service robots, this simple command reveals a complex challenge: inferring where everyday items are stored, often out of sight in drawers, cabinets, or closets. Despite advances in vision and manipulation, robots still lack the commonsense reasoning needed to complete this task. We introduce the Stored Household Item Challenge, a benchmark task for evaluating service robots' cognitive capabilities: given a household scene and a queried item, predict its most likely storage location.
  Our benchmark includes two datasets: (1) a real-world evaluation set of 100 item-image pairs with human-annotated ground truth from participants' kitchens, and (2) a development set of 6,500 item-image pairs annotated with storage polygons over public kitchen images. These datasets support realistic modeling of household organization and enable comparative evaluation across agent architectures.
  To begin tackling this challenge, we introduce NOAM (Non-visible Object Allocation Model), a hybrid agent pipeline that combines structured scene understanding with large language model inference. NOAM converts visual input into natural language descriptions of spatial context and visible containers, then prompts a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to infer the most likely hidden storage location. This integrated vision-language agent exhibits emergent commonsense reasoning and is designed for modular deployment within broader robotic systems.
  We evaluate NOAM against baselines including random selection, vision-language pipelines (Grounding-DINO + SAM), leading multimodal models (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o, Kosmos-2, LLaMA, Qwen), and human performance. NOAM significantly improves prediction accuracy and approaches human-level results, highlighting best practices for deploying cognitively capable agents in domestic environments.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的熵感知推测解码方法，通过动态熵惩罚机制减少低置信度错误传播，在多个推理基准上超越目标大语言模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码过度依赖草稿模型与目标模型的对齐，限制了性能提升潜力，需要突破目标模型固有性能上限的方法

Method: 在标准推测解码基础上引入动态熵惩罚：计算采样分布的熵值量化模型不确定性，当两模型熵值高且top-N预测重叠大时，拒绝当前标记并由目标模型重新采样

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，EASD持续优于现有推测解码方法，多数情况下超越目标大语言模型本身，同时保持与标准推测解码相当的效率

Conclusion: 通过草稿模型验证和熵感知机制，EASD能够突破目标模型的性能限制，为推测解码提供了性能超越目标模型的可能性

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates large language model (LLM) reasoning by using a small draft model to generate candidate tokens, which the target LLM either accepts directly or regenerates upon rejection. However, excessive alignment between the draft and target models constrains SD to the performance of the target LLM. To address this limitation, we propose Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD), a training-free enhancement. Building on standard SD, EASD incorporates a dynamic entropy-based penalty. At each decoding step, we employ the entropy of the sampling distribution to quantify model uncertainty. When both models exhibit high entropy with substantial overlap among their top-N predictions, the corresponding token is rejected and re-sampled by the target LLM. This penalty prevents low-confidence errors from propagating. By incorporating draft-model verification, EASD enables the possibility of surpassing the target model's inherent performance. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EASD consistently outperforms existing SD methods and, in most cases, surpasses the target LLM itself. We further prove that the efficiency of EASD is comparable to that of SD. The code can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

TL;DR: MiMo-Audio是一个通过扩展预训练数据到亿小时级别音频而获得少样本学习能力的音频语言模型，在多项音频任务上达到开源模型SOTA性能，并能泛化到未训练任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频模型通常需要针对特定任务进行微调，而人类只需少量示例或简单指令就能泛化到新音频任务。受GPT-3在文本领域通过扩展预训练实现强泛化能力的启发，研究者认为这一范式同样适用于音频领域。

Method: 1. 将MiMo-Audio的预训练数据扩展到超过1亿小时音频；2. 开发系统化评估方法；3. 在后期训练阶段构建多样化指令调优语料库；4. 在音频理解和生成中引入思维机制。

Conclusion: 通过大规模音频预训练，MiMo-Audio模型展现了类似人类的少样本学习能力和任务泛化能力，验证了扩展预训练范式在音频领域的有效性，为通用音频智能系统的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Existing audio language models typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning to accomplish particular audio tasks. In contrast, humans are able to generalize to new audio tasks with only a few examples or simple instructions. GPT-3 has shown that scaling next-token prediction pretraining enables strong generalization capabilities in text, and we believe this paradigm is equally applicable to the audio domain. By scaling MiMo-Audio's pretraining data to over one hundred million of hours, we observe the emergence of few-shot learning capabilities across a diverse set of audio tasks. We develop a systematic evaluation of these capabilities and find that MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond standard metrics, MiMo-Audio-7B-Base generalizes to tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, and speech editing. MiMo-Audio-7B-Base also demonstrates powerful speech continuation capabilities, capable of generating highly realistic talk shows, recitations, livestreaming and debates. At the post-training stage, we curate a diverse instruction-tuning corpus and introduce thinking mechanisms into both audio understanding and generation. MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct achieves open-source SOTA on audio understanding benchmarks (MMSU, MMAU, MMAR, MMAU-Pro), spoken dialogue benchmarks (Big Bench Audio, MultiChallenge Audio) and instruct-TTS evaluations, approaching or surpassing closed-source models.

TL;DR: 提出StressRoBERTa模型，通过跨条件迁移学习检测英文推文中的慢性压力，在F1分数上优于现有最佳系统3个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性压力是重要的公共卫生问题，社交媒体成为人们分享压力体验的平台，需要自动检测方法；研究探索利用临床相关疾病（抑郁、焦虑、PTSD）的数据提升压力检测效果。

Method: 采用RoBERTa模型，先在Stress-SMHD语料库（来自抑郁、焦虑、PTSD用户的1.08亿词）进行持续训练，再在SMM4H 2022 Task 8数据集上微调，实现跨条件迁移学习。

Result: StressRoBERTa在压力检测任务上达到82%的F1分数，比最佳共享任务系统高3%；相比原始RoBERTa提升1%；在Dreaddit数据集上达到81% F1，证明从临床语境到情境压力讨论的迁移有效性。

Conclusion: 针对压力相关疾病的跨条件迁移学习比通用心理健康训练能提供更强的表征能力，可有效提升社交媒体中慢性压力的自动检测性能。

Abstract: The prevalence of chronic stress represents a significant public health concern, with social media platforms like Twitter serving as important venues for individuals to share their experiences. This paper introduces StressRoBERTa, a cross-condition transfer learning approach for automatic detection of self-reported chronic stress in English tweets. The investigation examines whether continual training on clinically related conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD), disorders with high comorbidity with chronic stress, improves stress detection compared to general language models and broad mental health models. RoBERTa is continually trained on the Stress-SMHD corpus (108M words from users with self-reported diagnoses of depression, anxiety, and PTSD) and fine-tuned on the SMM4H 2022 Task 8 dataset. StressRoBERTa achieves 82% F1-score, outperforming the best shared task system (79% F1) by 3 percentage points. The results demonstrate that focused cross-condition transfer from stress-related disorders (+1% F1 over vanilla RoBERTa) provides stronger representations than general mental health training. Evaluation on Dreaddit (81% F1) further demonstrates transfer from clinical mental health contexts to situational stress discussions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新闻文本的自动偏见检测被广泛用于支持新闻分析和媒体问责，但人们对偏见检测模型如何做出决策或为何失败知之甚少。

Method: 使用基于SHAP的解释方法，对两种模型（基于BABE数据集微调的偏见检测器和领域自适应预训练RoBERTa模型）进行可解释性比较研究，分析正确和错误预测中的词级归因。

Result: 两种模型都关注相似的评价性语言类别，但在整合这些信号的方式上差异显著。偏见检测器模型对误报赋予更强的内部证据，导致系统性地过度标记中性新闻内容；而领域自适应模型的归因模式与预测结果更一致，误报减少63%。模型错误源于不同的语言机制，误报主要由话语层面的歧义驱动。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了可解释性评估对偏见检测系统的重要性，并表明架构和训练选择对模型可靠性和在新闻背景下的部署适用性具有关键影响。

Abstract: Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.

Motivation: 解析错误

Method: 解析错误

Result: 解析错误

Conclusion: 解析错误

Abstract: The success of expanded context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven increased use of broader context in retrieval-augmented generation. We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error. This finding highlights the need for further research into enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively decline requests when faced with inadequate information.

Motivation: 受机制可解释性研究的启发，发现中间注意力层编码的标记级假设会迭代优化至最终输出，因此探索利用注意力层标记分布生成对抗样本，以更自然的方式测试基于LLM的评估流程的鲁棒性。

Method: 从中间注意力层的标记分布中提取标记作为对抗扰动，在ArgQuality数据集上进行论证质量评估实验，使用LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B同时作为生成器和评估器，分析不同层和标记位置的影响。

Result: 注意力层生成的对抗样本能显著降低评估性能，同时保持与原始输入的语义相似性；但某些层和标记位置的替换会导致语法退化，限制了实际应用效果。

Conclusion: 中间层表示作为对抗样本的来源具有潜力，但目前存在语法退化等限制，为基于LLM的评估流程的压力测试提供了新的方向但需进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability suggest that intermediate attention layers encode token-level hypotheses that are iteratively refined toward the final output. In this work, we exploit this property to generate adversarial examples directly from attention-layer token distributions. Unlike prompt-based or gradient-based attacks, our approach leverages model-internal token predictions, producing perturbations that are both plausible and internally consistent with the model's own generation process. We evaluate whether tokens extracted from intermediate layers can serve as effective adversarial perturbations for downstream evaluation tasks. We conduct experiments on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset, with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B serving as both the generator and evaluator. Our results show that attention-based adversarial examples lead to measurable drops in evaluation performance while remaining semantically similar to the original inputs. However, we also observe that substitutions drawn from certain layers and token positions can introduce grammatical degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using intermediate-layer representations as a principled source of adversarial examples for stress-testing LLM-based evaluation pipelines.

Abstract: This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.

Motivation: 传统自动评分常混淆学生回答内容与教师评分倾向，缺乏对评分过程的透明分析与反思，需一种方法分离内容信号与评分者效应，使评分判断可审计。

Method: 使用ASSISTments数学回答数据，建模教师历史评分为动态先验；采用句子嵌入获取文本表征，通过中心化与残差化消除题目和教师混杂因素；构建时序验证线性模型量化各信号贡献，并通过投影可视化模型分歧。

Result: 教师先验对评分预测影响显著；结合先验与内容嵌入的模型效果最佳（AUC~0.815），纯内容模型较弱（AUC~0.626）；校正评分者效应可锐化内容表征，保留更多信息维度，揭示语义证据支持的理解差异。

Conclusion: 该框架将嵌入特征转化为可反思的学习分析工具，帮助教师与研究者检验评分实践与学生推理证据的一致性，促进评分过程的透明化与改进。

Abstract: Open-ended responses are central to learning, yet automated scoring often conflates what students wrote with how teachers grade. We present an analytics-first framework that separates content signals from rater tendencies, making judgments visible and auditable via analytics. Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and derive text representations from sentence embeddings, incorporating centering and residualization to mitigate prompt and teacher confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and a projection surfaces model disagreements for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the residual content representation, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond. The contribution presents a practical pipeline that transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.

TL;DR: 提出HGMem，一种基于超图的记忆机制，用于增强多步检索增强生成（RAG）中的全局理解和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统中的记忆模块多为被动存储，仅积累孤立事实，忽略了原始事实间的高阶关联，导致推理碎片化和全局理解能力弱。

Method: 将记忆表示为超图，其中超边对应不同的记忆单元，支持记忆内高阶交互的渐进形成，构建围绕核心问题的集成知识结构。

Result: 在多个全局理解挑战数据集上的实验表明，HGMem能持续改进多步RAG性能，显著优于强基线系统。

Conclusion: HGMem将记忆从简单存储扩展为动态表达结构，能有效提升复杂推理和全局理解能力。

Abstract: Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.

Motivation: 长上下文场景中全注意力计算成本高昂，需要一种能在有限计算预算下实现高效长序列处理的稀疏注意力方法。

Method: 提出LongCat ZigZag Attention (LoZA)稀疏注意力方案，通过将全注意力模型转换为稀疏版本，应用于LongCat-Flash模型进行中期训练。

Result: LoZA在预填充密集型和解码密集型任务中均能实现显著加速；LongCat-Flash-Exp模型可高效处理长达100万token的序列，支持长期推理和长视野智能体能力。

Conclusion: LoZA是一种有效的稀疏注意力方案，能显著提升长上下文处理效率，为大规模长序列推理和智能体应用提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce LongCat ZigZag Attention (LoZA), which is a sparse attention scheme designed to transform any existing full-attention models into sparse versions with rather limited compute budget. In long-context scenarios, LoZA can achieve significant speed-ups both for prefill-intensive (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) and decode-intensive (e.g., tool-integrated reasoning) cases. Specifically, by applying LoZA to LongCat-Flash during mid-training, we serve LongCat-Flash-Exp as a long-context foundation model that can swiftly process up to 1 million tokens, enabling efficient long-term reasoning and long-horizon agentic capabilities.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型和有监督方法对新型错误缺乏鲁棒性，且依赖昂贵的标注数据，难以应对现实场景中的大规模中文拼写纠错需求。

Method: 从干净文本合成错误输入，通过语义相似性和候选一致性计算聚类共识奖励，使用PPO算法优化策略，实现无标签的强化学习训练。

Result: 在9个基准测试中，比有监督基线提升10-13个F1分数，比强LLM微调方法提升5-8个F1分数，并提供无偏奖励和收敛的理论保证。

Conclusion: CEC-Zero建立了无标签的鲁棒可扩展中文拼写纠错新范式，释放了大语言模型在噪声文本处理中的潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale Chinese spelling correction (CSC) remains critical for real-world text processing, yet existing LLMs and supervised methods lack robustness to novel errors and rely on costly annotations. We introduce CEC-Zero, a zero-supervision reinforcement learning framework that addresses this by enabling LLMs to correct their own mistakes. CEC-Zero synthesizes errorful inputs from clean text, computes cluster-consensus rewards via semantic similarity and candidate agreement, and optimizes the policy with PPO. It outperforms supervised baselines by 10--13 F$_1$ points and strong LLM fine-tunes by 5--8 points across 9 benchmarks, with theoretical guarantees of unbiased rewards and convergence. CEC-Zero establishes a label-free paradigm for robust, scalable CSC, unlocking LLM potential in noisy text pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督框架RISE，通过稀疏自编码器从大语言模型的激活空间中自动发现并控制推理行为向量，无需人工定义概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工定义词汇级概念（如过度思考、反思）来监督分析推理过程，但难以涵盖所有潜在推理行为，且许多行为难以在词元空间中定义。

Method: 将思维链轨迹分割为句子级'步骤'，在步骤级激活上训练稀疏自编码器（SAE），以发现编码不同推理行为的激活空间方向（即推理向量）。

Result: SAE能分离出可解释的推理行为（如反思、回溯），可视化显示这些行为在解码器列空间中占据可区分区域；通过干预SAE衍生的向量可可控地增强或抑制特定推理行为，还能发现超越人工监督的新行为（如识别置信度相关向量）。

Conclusion: 无监督潜在发现方法具有解释和可控引导大语言模型推理的潜力，为理解模型内部推理机制提供了新途径。

Abstract: Despite the growing reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), their internal mechanisms during the reasoning process remain underexplored. Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有基于显式文本规划的推理方法存在幻觉问题且难以泛化，受人类潜意识认知启发，希望让LLM学习紧凑的隐式规划模式。

Method: 1. 从现有推理轨迹中蒸馏显式规划；2. 通过向量量化自编码器学习规划的离散表示；3. 微调LLM使其能同时生成潜在规划和推理步骤。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务上，iCLP显著提升了准确率和效率，并展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 潜在空间规划使LLM能够进行隐式推理规划，在保持链式思维可解释性的同时，提高了性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), when guided by explicit textual plans, can perform reliable step-by-step reasoning during problem-solving. However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: Distinguishing fake or untrue news from satire or humor poses a unique challenge due to their overlapping linguistic features and divergent intent. This study develops WISE (Web Information Satire and Fakeness Evaluation) framework which benchmarks eight lightweight transformer models alongside two baseline models on a balanced dataset of 20,000 samples from Fakeddit, annotated as either fake news or satire. Using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, we evaluate models across comprehensive metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, MCC, Brier score, and Expected Calibration Error. Our evaluation reveals that MiniLM, a lightweight model, achieves the highest accuracy (87.58%) among all models, while RoBERTa-base achieves the highest ROC-AUC (95.42%) and strong accuracy (87.36%). DistilBERT offers an excellent efficiency-accuracy trade-off with 86.28\% accuracy and 93.90\% ROC-AUC. Statistical tests confirm significant performance differences between models, with paired t-tests and McNemar tests providing rigorous comparisons. Our findings highlight that lightweight models can match or exceed baseline performance, offering actionable insights for deploying misinformation detection systems in real-world, resource-constrained settings.

Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗、法律、金融等关键决策领域应用日益广泛，但其可靠性存在不确定性，常出现过度自信错误、输入扰动下性能下降且缺乏明确的不确定性估计，现有评估方法零散且仅关注孤立方面。

Method: 提出CRS统一框架，通过整合校准性、鲁棒性和不确定性量化三个维度构建综合评分；在五个问答数据集上对十个主流开源大语言模型进行实验，评估其在基线、扰动和校准方法下的表现。

Result: CRS能提供稳定的模型排名，揭示单一指标遗漏的隐藏故障模式，并表明最可靠的系统需要在准确性、鲁棒性和校准不确定性之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: CRS框架为评估大语言模型可靠性提供了统一且可解释的方法，有助于识别在关键决策应用中更可靠的模型系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma are increasingly used in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, law, and finance, yet their reliability remains uncertain. They often make overconfident errors, degrade under input shifts, and lack clear uncertainty estimates. Existing evaluations are fragmented, addressing only isolated aspects. We introduce the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), a unified framework that integrates calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification into a single interpretable metric. Through experiments on ten leading open-source LLMs across five QA datasets, we assess performance under baselines, perturbations, and calibration methods. CRS delivers stable model rankings, uncovers hidden failure modes missed by single metrics, and highlights that the most dependable systems balance accuracy, robustness, and calibrated uncertainty.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) generate text through an iterative denoising process. They have recently gained attention due to mask-parallel decoding and competitive performance with autoregressive large language models. However, effective mechanisms for inference-time control and steering in MDLMs remain largely unexplored. We present an activation-steering framework for MDLMs that computes layer-wise steering vectors from a single forward pass using contrastive examples, without simulating the denoising trajectory. These directions are applied at every reverse-diffusion step, yielding an efficient inference-time control mechanism. Experiments on LLaDA-8B-Instruct demonstrate reliable modulation of high-level attributes, with ablations examining the effects of steering across transformer sub-modules and token scope (prompt vs.\ response).

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型主要关注物理世界规律，缺乏对情感因素的系统探索，而情感作为世界知识的关键组成部分，对人类决策有重要影响。研究表明移除情感信息会降低推理性能，因此需要构建能建模情感的世界模型。

Method: 基于心理理论启发，构建Emotion-Why-How（EWH）数据集，将情感融入因果关系以推理行为动机和情感驱动；提出LEWM模型，显式建模情感状态、视觉观察和行动，预测未来状态和情感转变。

Result: 实验显示LEWM能更准确预测情感驱动的社会行为，同时在基础任务上保持与通用世界模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 情感是世界理解的重要维度，LEWM通过整合情感建模提升了世界模型对社会动态的预测能力，为情感感知的AI系统发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: World Models serve as tools for understanding the current state of the world and predicting its future dynamics, with broad application potential across numerous fields. As a key component of world knowledge, emotion significantly influences human decision-making. While existing Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown preliminary capability in capturing world knowledge, they primarily focus on modeling physical-world regularities and lack systematic exploration of emotional factors. In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world by showing that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance. Inspired by theory of mind, we further propose a Large Emotional World Model (LEWM). Specifically, we construct the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, which integrates emotion into causal relationships and enables reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states. Based on this dataset, LEWM explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions, allowing the world model to predict both future states and emotional transitions. Experimental results show that LEWM more accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors while maintaining comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.

This technical report mainly presents the underlying training infrastructure that enables reliable and efficient scaling to frontier model sizes. We detail systematic methodologies for operator-level and end-to-end numerical accuracy verification, ensuring consistency across hardware platforms and distributed parallelism strategies. Furthermore, we introduce a suite of performance optimizations, including interleaved pipeline scheduling, attention-aware data scheduling for long-sequence training,hierarchical and overlapped communication for expert parallelism, and DVM-based operator fusion. A systematic parallelization framework, leveraging analytical estimation and integer linear programming, is also proposed to optimize multi-dimensional parallelism configurations. Additionally, we present methodological approaches to cluster-level optimizations, addressing host- and device-bound bottlenecks during large-scale training tasks. These infrastructure advancements yield significant throughput improvements and near-linear scaling on clusters comprising thousands of devices, providing a robust foundation for large-scale language model development on hardware ecosystems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise in clinical diagnosis. However, current models struggle to emulate the iterative, diagnostic hypothesis-driven reasoning of real clinical scenarios. Specifically, current LLMs suffer from three critical limitations: (1) generating hallucinated medical content due to weak grounding in verified knowledge, (2) asking redundant or inefficient questions rather than discriminative ones that hinder diagnostic progress, and (3) losing coherence over multi-turn dialogues, leading to contradictory or inconsistent conclusions. To address these challenges, we propose MedKGI, a diagnostic framework grounded in clinical practices. MedKGI integrates a medical knowledge graph (KG) to constrain reasoning to validated medical ontologies, selects questions based on information gain to maximize diagnostic efficiency, and adopts an OSCE-format structured state to maintain consistent evidence tracking across turns. Experiments on clinical benchmarks show that MedKGI outperforms strong LLM baselines in both diagnostic accuracy and inquiry efficiency, improving dialogue efficiency by 30% on average while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种能同时处理专利和科学文献的语言相似性模型，以更好地分析专利与学术论文之间的关联，并探究不同司法管辖区专利引用行为的差异。

Method: 基于SPECTER2模型在专利数据上进行微调，构建Pat-SPECTER模型；通过马赛式评估比较八种语言相似性模型；在两种实际场景中测试模型性能；验证美国专利引用论文语义相似度较低的假设。

Result: Pat-SPECTER模型在预测专利-论文引用方面表现最佳；验证了美国专利因诚信义务要求，其引用的论文语义相似度低于其他主要司法管辖区。

Conclusion: Pat-SPECTER模型能有效分析专利与学术文献的关联，为学术界和实践者提供了实用工具；研究揭示了不同司法管辖区专利引用行为的系统性差异。

Abstract: We develop a language similarity model suitable for working with patents and scientific publications at the same time. In a horse race-style evaluation, we subject eight language (similarity) models to predict credible Patent-Paper Citations. We find that our Pat-SPECTER model performs best, which is the SPECTER2 model fine-tuned on patents. In two real-world scenarios (separating patent-paper-pairs and predicting patent-paper-pairs) we demonstrate the capabilities of the Pat-SPECTER. We finally test the hypothesis that US patents cite papers that are semantically less similar than in other large jurisdictions, which we posit is because of the duty of candor. The model is open for the academic community and practitioners alike.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DATAMASK框架，用于大规模预训练数据选择，能同时优化质量和多样性指标，显著提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法在万亿规模预训练数据上存在局限：基于质量指标的选择在长期预训练中收益递减，基于多样性指标的选择会丢失高质量样本，且现有方法难以同时考虑多种指标

Method: 将数据选择建模为掩码学习问题，通过迭代采样数据掩码、基于预定义目标计算策略梯度、更新掩码采样对数，采用策略梯度优化和多种加速增强技术

Result: 相比贪婪算法减少98.9%选择时间，从15万亿token的FineWeb数据集中选择约10%子集FineWeb-Mask，在12个任务上使1.5B密集模型提升3.2%，7B MoE模型提升1.9%

Conclusion: DATAMASK框架能高效实现大规模预训练数据的联合选择，平衡质量和多样性，显著提升语言模型能力

Abstract: A fine-grained data recipe is crucial for pre-training large language models, as it can significantly enhance training efficiency and model performance. One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.

TL;DR: 本文针对欧盟分类法合规流程，构建首个公开基准数据集，系统评估大语言模型在定性与定量任务上的表现，发现模型在定性任务中表现中等，在定量任务中完全失败，但可作为专家辅助工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧盟分类法合规流程依赖人工且资源密集，大语言模型虽能提供自动化可能，但缺乏公开基准数据集阻碍了相关研究。

Method: 从190份企业报告中构建结构化数据集，包含真实经济活动与定量关键绩效指标；采用多步骤智能体框架评估大语言模型在合规流程中的表现，包括零样本预测任务。

Result: 模型在定性经济活动识别任务中表现中等，多步骤框架略微提升精度；在定量关键绩效指标预测任务中完全失败；发现简洁元数据常优于非结构化报告，且模型置信度校准较差。

Conclusion: 大语言模型尚未能实现全自动化合规，但可作为人类专家的有力辅助工具；所构建数据集为未来研究提供了公开基准。

Abstract: The manual, resource-intensive process of complying with the EU Taxonomy presents a significant challenge for companies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, research is hindered by a lack of public benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, structured dataset from 190 corporate reports, containing ground-truth economic activities and quantitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We use this dataset to conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs on the core compliance workflow. Our results reveal a clear performance gap between qualitative and quantitative tasks. LLMs show moderate success in the qualitative task of identifying economic activities, with a multi-step agentic framework modestly enhancing precision. Conversely, the models comprehensively fail at the quantitative task of predicting financial KPIs in a zero-shot setting. We also discover a paradox, where concise metadata often yields superior performance to full, unstructured reports, and find that model confidence scores are poorly calibrated. We conclude that while LLMs are not ready for full automation, they can serve as powerful assistive tools for human experts. Our dataset provides a public benchmark for future research.

TL;DR: FIGR通过强化学习将视觉思维融入多轮推理，构建视觉表征以捕捉文本难以表达的全局结构约束，在数学推理基准上显著优于纯文本方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂推理问题常涉及隐含的空间、几何和结构关系，这些关系难以通过纯文本推理有效捕捉，需要一种能处理全局结构约束的方法。

Method: 采用端到端强化学习框架，在问题求解过程中动态构建视觉表征，自适应地调控视觉推理的时机与方式，实现多模态推理。

Result: 在AIME 2025和BeyondAIME基准上，FIGR分别比纯文本思维链基线提升13.12%和11.00%，证明了其在复杂推理中的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合视觉引导的多模态推理能显著提升复杂推理的稳定性与可靠性，为处理隐含结构关系问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Complex reasoning problems often involve implicit spatial, geometric, and structural relationships that are not explicitly encoded in text. While recent reasoning models have achieved strong performance across many domains, purely text-based reasoning struggles to represent global structural constraints in complex settings. In this paper, we introduce FIGR, which integrates active visual thinking into multi-turn reasoning via end-to-end reinforcement learning. FIGR externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving. By adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked, FIGR enables more stable and coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines. In particular, FIGR improves the base model by 13.12% on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME, highlighting the effectiveness of figure-guided multimodal reasoning in enhancing the stability and reliability of complex reasoning.

*Keito Inoshita,Shinnosuke Mizuno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于世界模型推理的讽刺理解方法WM-SAR，通过分解讽刺的认知要素并量化语义不一致性，在保持可解释性的同时提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有讽刺理解方法多为黑盒模型，难以解释认知机制；且缺乏对语义评估与规范期望之间不匹配的显式建模框架。

Method: 将讽刺理解重构为世界模型推理过程，使用基于LLM的智能体分解字面意义、语境、规范期望和意图，通过量化不一致性分数和意图分数，由逻辑回归模型集成预测。

Result: 在多个讽刺检测基准测试中，WM-SAR性能优于现有深度学习和LLM方法；消融实验表明语义不一致性和意图推理对检测效果至关重要。

Conclusion: WM-SAR通过显式建模讽刺的认知要素和量化推理过程，实现了高性能与高可解释性的平衡，为复杂语言现象的理解提供了结构化框架。

Abstract: Sarcasm understanding is a challenging problem in natural language processing, as it requires capturing the discrepancy between the surface meaning of an utterance and the speaker's intentions as well as the surrounding social context. Although recent advances in deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially improved performance, most existing approaches still rely on black-box predictions of a single model, making it difficult to structurally explain the cognitive factors underlying sarcasm. Moreover, while sarcasm often emerges as a mismatch between semantic evaluation and normative expectations or intentions, frameworks that explicitly decompose and model these components remain limited. In this work, we reformulate sarcasm understanding as a world model inspired reasoning process and propose World Model inspired SArcasm Reasoning (WM-SAR), which decomposes literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention into specialized LLM-based agents. The discrepancy between literal evaluation and normative expectation is explicitly quantified as a deterministic inconsistency score, and together with an intention score, these signals are integrated by a lightweight Logistic Regression model to infer the final sarcasm probability. This design leverages the reasoning capability of LLMs while maintaining an interpretable numerical decision structure. Experiments on representative sarcasm detection benchmarks show that WM-SAR consistently outperforms existing deep learning and LLM-based methods. Ablation studies and case analyses further demonstrate that integrating semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning is essential for effective sarcasm detection, achieving both strong performance and high interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了金融领域大模型QianfanHuijin及一种通用的多阶段训练范式，通过持续预训练和细粒度后训练（金融SFT、金融推理RL、金融智能体RL、通用RL）增强模型的知识、推理与智能体能力，在多个权威金融基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融服务的复杂性日益增加，现有模型（如BloombergGPT、Baichuan-Finance）主要关注知识增强，但行业需要同时具备领域知识、金融推理能力和智能体能力的模型。

Method: 采用多阶段训练范式：1. 在金融语料上进行持续预训练（CPT）巩固知识基础；2. 细粒度后训练，依次进行金融SFT、金融推理强化学习（RL）、金融智能体RL，最终进行与真实业务场景对齐的通用RL。

Result: QianfanHuijin在多个权威金融基准测试中表现优异；消融实验证实推理RL和智能体RL阶段分别显著提升了相应能力。

Conclusion: 该细粒度、渐进式的后训练方法验证了研究动机，有望成为各类工业增强大模型的主流范式。

Abstract: Domain-specific enhancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the financial context has long been a focal point of industrial application. While previous models such as BloombergGPT and Baichuan-Finance primarily focused on knowledge enhancement, the deepening complexity of financial services has driven a growing demand for models that possess not only domain knowledge but also robust financial reasoning and agentic capabilities. In this paper, we present QianfanHuijin, a financial domain LLM, and propose a generalizable multi-stage training paradigm for industrial model enhancement.
  Our approach begins with Continual Pre-training (CPT) on financial corpora to consolidate the knowledge base. This is followed by a fine-grained Post-training pipeline designed with increasing specificity: starting with Financial SFT, progressing to Finance Reasoning RL and Finance Agentic RL, and culminating in General RL aligned with real-world business scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate that QianfanHuijin achieves superior performance across various authoritative financial benchmarks. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that the targeted Reasoning RL and Agentic RL stages yield significant gains in their respective capabilities. These findings validate our motivation and suggest that this fine-grained, progressive post-training methodology is poised to become a mainstream paradigm for various industrial-enhanced LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出CREST方法，通过识别并干预大语言模型中的特定注意力头来优化推理过程，在提高准确率的同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的长链推理常存在效率低下问题，如生成过多token导致延迟高，或推理不稳定（思考过浅或过度重复），需要一种能提升效率与稳定性的方法。

Method: CREST方法包含两步：离线校准识别与认知行为相关的注意力头并生成干预向量；推理时通过旋转隐藏表示抑制低效推理行为。该方法无需训练。

Result: 在多种推理基准测试和模型上，CREST将准确率最高提升17.5%，同时减少37.6%的token使用量。

Conclusion: CREST提供了一种简单有效的路径，能显著提升大语言模型推理的速度与可靠性，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学摘要中常包含版权声明、章节标题、作者注释等无关信息，这些信息会扭曲文档相似性分析和文本嵌入等下游任务的结果。

Method: 开发了一个易于集成的开源语言模型，专门用于自动识别并移除英文科学摘要中的无关内容。

Result: 该模型具有保守性和精确性，能够改变清理后摘要的相似性排序，并提升标准长度嵌入的信息含量。

Conclusion: 该模型能有效清理科学摘要中的干扰信息，为基于摘要的文本分析提供更可靠的数据基础。

Abstract: Scientific abstracts are often used as proxies for the content and thematic focus of research publications. However, a significant share of published abstracts contains extraneous information-such as publisher copyright statements, section headings, author notes, registrations, and bibliometric or bibliographic metadata-that can distort downstream analyses, particularly those involving document similarity or textual embeddings. We introduce an open-source, easy-to-integrate language model designed to clean English-language scientific abstracts by automatically identifying and removing such clutter. We demonstrate that our model is both conservative and precise, alters similarity rankings of cleaned abstracts and improves information content of standard-length embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动文本摘要在高资源语言（如英语）中已取得高性能，但对低资源语言的摘要研究关注较少，需要探索适合低资源语言的有效方法。

Method: 比较了多种方法：1）不同规模LLM的零样本提示；2）使用三种数据增强方法和多语言迁移微调mT5模型；3）LLM翻译管道（源语言→英语→摘要→译回）。使用五种指标进行评估。

Result: 1）相似参数规模的LLM性能存在差异；2）多语言微调的mT5基线在多数指标上优于其他方法（包括零样本LLM）；3）LLM作为评估器在低资源语言中可靠性较低。

Conclusion: 对于低资源语言摘要，微调的多语言模型（如mT5）比零样本LLM方法更有效，且需谨慎使用LLM作为低资源语言的评估工具。

Abstract: Automatic text summarization has achieved high performance in high-resourced languages like English, but comparatively less attention has been given to summarization in less-resourced languages. This work compares a variety of different approaches to summarization from zero-shot prompting of LLMs large and small to fine-tuning smaller models like mT5 with and without three data augmentation approaches and multilingual transfer. We also explore an LLM translation pipeline approach, translating from the source language to English, summarizing and translating back. Evaluating with five different metrics, we find that there is variation across LLMs in their performance across similar parameter sizes, that our multilingual fine-tuned mT5 baseline outperforms most other approaches including zero-shot LLM performance for most metrics, and that LLM as judge may be less reliable on less-resourced languages.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于人类略读策略的自监督对比学习框架，通过随机掩码文档段落并使用NLI对比目标来增强长文档表示，在法学和生物医学文本上取得显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在处理法律、医学等领域的长文档时存在困难：稀疏注意力机制资源消耗大且难以捕获全文上下文，分层Transformer模型效率较高但无法明确解释文档不同部分间的关联。受人类略读时聚焦关键段落理解整体内容的策略启发，需要开发更高效且能捕捉文档全局语义的表示方法。

Method: 采用自监督对比学习框架：1）随机掩码文档中的某个段落；2）基于自然语言推理（NLI）设计对比学习目标，使被掩码段落与文档相关部分对齐，同时与不相关部分保持距离；3）模拟人类信息整合过程，生成更丰富且计算高效的文档表示。

Result: 在法学和生物医学文本上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均取得显著提升，验证了其对于长文档表示的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类略读策略设计的自监督对比学习框架，能够生成更高效且语义丰富的长文档表示，为法律、医学等专业领域的长文本处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown strong performance in word- and sentence-level tasks, effectively representing long documents, especially in fields like law and medicine, remains difficult. Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 探究LLMs是否具备自我能力认知，能否预测任务成功率并在多步骤任务中调整预测，以及在失败成本高的场景中能否通过学习经验做出更优决策。

Method: 测试多种LLMs在单步及多步任务中的成功率预测能力，分析模型规模、推理机制的影响，并通过提供失败经验观察模型决策行为的变化。

Result: 所有测试模型均表现过度自信，但多数具备优于随机的判别能力；模型规模与判别能力无明确正相关；多步任务中过度自信加剧；部分模型能从失败经验中降低过度自信并改善决策。

Conclusion: 当前LLM智能体因缺乏自我能力认知而受限，过度乐观的估计导致决策失误；模型对自身能力的认知程度与AI滥用和错位风险相关。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict whether they will succeed on a given task and whether their predictions improve as they progress through multi-step tasks. We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的雅思写作备考方法缺乏针对雅思评分标准的个性化反馈，导致考生难以有效提升写作水平。

Method: 采用设计研究法进行多轮迭代开发：早期使用规则方法，后期转为基于DistilBERT变换器模型（带回归头）的自动评分系统，并结合自适应反馈机制。平台架构将对话指导与写作界面分离以降低认知负荷。

Result: 规则方法效果不佳（负R²值），变换器模型显著提升评分准确性（MAE=0.66，正R²）。自适应反馈使写作成绩平均提高0.06分（p=0.011），但效果因修改策略而异：保守的表层修正比激进的结构调整更可靠。

Conclusion: 自动反馈功能更适合作为人工指导的补充；对高分作文的评估仍存挑战，未来需开展长期实证研究并引入官方考官验证。

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a proposed revision platform assisting candidates for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) writing exam. Traditional IELTS preparation methods lack personalised feedback, catered to the IELTS writing rubric. To address these shortcomings, the platform features an attractive user interface (UI), an Automated Essay Scoring system (AES), and targeted feedback tailored to candidates and the IELTS writing rubric. The platform architecture separates conversational guidance from a dedicated writing interface to reduce cognitive load and simulate exam conditions. Through iterative, Design-Based Research (DBR) cycles, the study progressed from rule-based to transformer-based with a regression head scoring, mounted with adaptive feedback.
  Early cycles (2-3) revealed fundamental limitations of rule-based approaches: mid-band compression, low accuracy, and negative $R^2$ values. DBR Cycle 4 implemented a DistilBERT transformer model with a regression head, yielding substantial improvements with MAE of 0.66 and positive $R^2$. This enabled Cycle 5's adaptive feedback implementation, which demonstrated statistically significant score improvements (mean +0.060 bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504), though effectiveness varied by revision strategy. Findings suggest automated feedback functions are most suited as a supplement to human instruction, with conservative surface-level corrections proving more reliable than aggressive structural interventions for IELTS preparation contexts. Challenges remain in assessing higher-band essays, and future work should incorporate longitudinal studies with real IELTS candidates and validation from official examiners.

Motivation: 现有辩论系统缺乏跨轮次的立场一致性和证据连贯性，需要结合修辞学与记忆研究，实现论据的回忆与适应性复用。

Method: 基于论证记忆的智能体框架：1）构建辩论知识库用于检索类案例证据和历史辩论策略；2）角色化智能体生成跨轮次连贯表述；3）在ORCHID数据集上评估单轮生成与多轮对抗模拟任务。

Result: 1）单轮生成任务在InspireScore（主观/逻辑/事实维度）表现更优；2）多轮模拟在Debatrix评估（论证/来源/语言/整体）得分更高；3）20位专业辩手的人类评估确认其立场一致性与证据使用有效性。

Conclusion: 检索增强与结构化规划的结合能产生更忠实、立场对齐且连贯的多轮辩论，论证记忆机制是提升辩论系统性能的关键。

Abstract: We present R-Debater, an agentic framework for generating multi-turn debates built on argumentative memory. Grounded in rhetoric and memory studies, the system views debate as a process of recalling and adapting prior arguments to maintain stance consistency, respond to opponents, and support claims with evidence. Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.

Conclusion: 该研究的资源和方将段落分割确立为语音处理中标准化、实用的任务，为语音转录的结构化后处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic speech transcripts are often delivered as unstructured word streams that impede readability and repurposing. We recast paragraph segmentation as the missing structuring step and fill three gaps at the intersection of speech processing and text segmentation. First, we establish TEDPara (human-annotated TED talks) and YTSegPara (YouTube videos with synthetic labels) as the first benchmarks for the paragraph segmentation task. The benchmarks focus on the underexplored speech domain, where paragraph segmentation has traditionally not been part of post-processing, while also contributing to the wider text segmentation field, which still lacks robust and naturalistic benchmarks. Second, we propose a constrained-decoding formulation that lets large language models insert paragraph breaks while preserving the original transcript, enabling faithful, sentence-aligned evaluation. Third, we show that a compact model (MiniSeg) attains state-of-the-art accuracy and, when extended hierarchically, jointly predicts chapters and paragraphs with minimal computational cost. Together, our resources and methods establish paragraph segmentation as a standardized, practical task in speech processing.

Motivation: 随着NLP系统日益普及，将伦理考量融入NLP教育变得至关重要，但课程开发面临领域快速发展和培养批判性思维等挑战。

Method: 采用基于主动学习的教学方法，包括互动课程、实践活动和“以教促学”策略，课程经过四年在不同机构、教育层次和跨学科背景下的优化调整。

Result: 课程不仅产生了可重复使用的教学材料，还由学生制作了面向不同受众的实际教育产品，成功适应了多种教育环境。

Conclusion: 通过分享课程方法和经验，为教育工作者将社会影响考量融入课程提供了启发和参考。

Abstract: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems become more pervasive, integrating ethical considerations into NLP education has become essential. However, this presents inherent challenges in curriculum development: the field's rapid evolution from both academia and industry, and the need to foster critical thinking beyond traditional technical training. We introduce our course on Ethical Aspects in NLP and our pedagogical approach, grounded in active learning through interactive sessions, hands-on activities, and "learning by teaching" methods. Over four years, the course has been refined and adapted across different institutions, educational levels, and interdisciplinary backgrounds; it has also yielded many reusable products, both in the form of teaching materials and in the form of actual educational products aimed at diverse audiences, made by the students themselves. By sharing our approach and experience, we hope to provide inspiration for educators seeking to incorporate social impact considerations into their curricula.

*Muhammad Abdullahi Said,Muhammad Sammani Sani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在英语与豪萨语之间的安全性对齐存在复杂干扰现象，而非简单的低资源语言性能下降，揭示安全性受语言和时态框架交互影响的动态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前假设安全对齐能零样本从英语迁移到其他语言存在危险盲点，特别是对全球南方用户面临本土化威胁场景（如西非诈骗）时缺乏系统评估。

Method: 使用基于西非威胁场景的对抗数据集HausaSafety，对GPT-5.1、Gemini 3 Pro和Claude 4.5 Opus进行2（语言：英语/豪萨语）×4（时态框架）因子设计，共1440次评估，分析非线性交互作用。

Result: 发现复杂干扰机制：Claude 4.5 Opus在豪萨语中安全性（45.0%）反超英语（36.7%），但时态推理存在灾难性失败；过去时框架绕过防御（15.6%安全），未来时触发过度保守拒绝（57.2%安全），最安全与最脆弱配置相差9.2倍。

Conclusion: 当前模型依赖表面启发式而非稳健语义理解，形成安全性口袋，使全球南方用户暴露于本土化危害；需转向不变性对齐范式以确保跨语言和时态的安全稳定性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into critical global infrastructure, the assumption that safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages remains a dangerous blind spot. This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the prevailing multilingual safety gap narrative. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a mechanism of Complex Interference where safety is determined by the intersection of variables. While models exhibited a Reverse Linguistic with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HaluNet框架，通过融合多粒度令牌级不确定性和语义表示，实现轻量级可训练的大语言模型幻觉检测，在多个QA数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在问答中常产生幻觉（事实错误或虚构内容），现有方法多关注单一不确定性类型，忽略了不同不确定性来源（特别是令牌级概率不确定性和内部语义表示不确定性）之间的互补性。

Method: 提出HaluNet框架，结合语义嵌入与概率置信度及分布不确定性，通过多分支架构自适应融合模型已知信息与输出中表达的不确定性，实现高效单次幻觉检测。

Result: 在SQuAD、TriviaQA和Natural Questions数据集上的实验表明，HaluNet具有强大的检测性能和良好的计算效率，无论是否访问上下文均表现稳定。

Conclusion: HaluNet展示了在基于LLM的QA系统中进行实时幻觉检测的潜力，其轻量级设计和多不确定性融合策略为幻觉检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at question answering (QA) but often generate hallucinations, including factual errors or fabricated content. Detecting hallucinations from internal uncertainty signals is attractive due to its scalability and independence from external resources. Existing methods often aim to accurately capture a single type of uncertainty while overlooking the complementarity among different sources, particularly between token-level probability uncertainty and the uncertainty conveyed by internal semantic representations, which provide complementary views on model reliability. We present \textbf{HaluNet}, a lightweight and trainable neural framework that integrates multi granular token level uncertainties by combining semantic embeddings with probabilistic confidence and distributional uncertainty. Its multi branch architecture adaptively fuses what the model knows with the uncertainty expressed in its outputs, enabling efficient one pass hallucination detection. Experiments on SQuAD, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions show that HaluNet delivers strong detection performance and favorable computational efficiency, with or without access to context, highlighting its potential for real time hallucination detection in LLM based QA systems.

Abstract: We introduce the Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark (KCL), a benchmark designed to assess language models' legal reasoning capabilities independently of domain-specific knowledge. KCL provides question-level supporting precedents, enabling a more faithful disentanglement of reasoning ability from parameterized knowledge. KCL consists of two components: (1) KCL-MCQA, multiple-choice problems of 283 questions with 1,103 aligned precedents, and (2) KCL-Essay, open-ended generation problems of 169 questions with 550 aligned precedents and 2,739 instance-level rubrics for automated evaluation. Our systematic evaluation of 30+ models shows large remaining gaps, particularly in KCL-Essay, and that reasoning-specialized models consistently outperform their general-purpose counterparts.

Motivation: 现有基于最终轮次对比的偏好数据集难以捕捉多轮对话的细微差别，导致多轮对话自动评估效果不佳，需要更有效的训练数据构建方法。

Method: 提出无监督数据增强策略MUSIC，通过合成跨多轮次存在差异的对比对话对，基于Skywork偏好数据集训练Gemma-2-9B-Instruct多轮奖励模型。

Conclusion: 跨多轮次的对比数据对构建稳健的多轮奖励模型至关重要，MUSIC策略能有效提升多轮对话评估质量，为LLM训练提供可扩展的评估信号。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of multi-turn conversations is crucial for developing capable Large Language Models (LLMs), yet remains a significant challenge, often requiring costly human evaluation. Multi-turn reward models (RMs) offer a scalable alternative and can provide valuable signals for guiding LLM training. While recent work has advanced multi-turn \textit{training} techniques, effective automated \textit{evaluation} specifically for multi-turn interactions lags behind. We observe that standard preference datasets, typically contrasting responses based only on the final conversational turn, provide insufficient signal to capture the nuances of multi-turn interactions. Instead, we find that incorporating contrasts spanning \textit{multiple} turns is critical for building robust multi-turn RMs. Motivated by this finding, we propose \textbf{MU}lti-\textbf{S}tep \textbf{I}nstruction \textbf{C}ontrast (MUSIC), an unsupervised data augmentation strategy that synthesizes contrastive conversation pairs exhibiting differences across multiple turns. Leveraging MUSIC on the Skywork preference dataset, we train a multi-turn RM based on the Gemma-2-9B-Instruct model. Empirical results demonstrate that our MUSIC-augmented RM outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher alignment with judgments from advanced proprietary LLM judges on multi-turn conversations, crucially, without compromising performance on standard single-turn RM benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PrivacyBench基准测试，用于评估AI助手在对话中泄露用户隐私秘密的情况，发现现有RAG架构存在严重隐私泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化AI代理需要访问用户的数字足迹（如私人邮件、聊天记录等），但缺乏社会语境意识的系统可能无意中泄露用户秘密，威胁数字福祉，这构成了根本性的社会和隐私风险。

Method: 1. 构建PrivacyBench基准测试，包含社会情境数据集（嵌入秘密信息）和多轮对话评估框架；2. 测试检索增强生成（RAG）助手在对话中的秘密保留能力；3. 尝试使用隐私意识提示来降低泄露率。

Result: 1. RAG助手在高达26.56%的交互中泄露秘密；2. 使用隐私意识提示后泄露率降至5.12%，但仅提供部分缓解；3. 检索机制仍会无差别访问敏感数据，将隐私保护负担完全转移给生成器，形成单点故障。

Conclusion: 当前AI架构在大规模部署中存在安全隐患，迫切需要结构化的、隐私优先的设计保障措施，以确保为所有人构建道德和包容的网络环境。

Abstract: Personalized AI agents rely on access to a user's digital footprint, which often includes sensitive data from private emails, chats and purchase histories. Yet this access creates a fundamental societal and privacy risk: systems lacking social-context awareness can unintentionally expose user secrets, threatening digital well-being. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and a multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret preservation. Testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants reveals that they leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator. This creates a single point of failure, rendering current architectures unsafe for wide-scale deployment. Our findings underscore the urgent need for structural, privacy-by-design safeguards to ensure an ethical and inclusive web for everyone.

TL;DR: Youtu-LLM是一个1.96B参数的轻量级语言模型，通过从零开始预训练和精心设计的课程学习，在保持高效计算的同时实现了强大的推理和规划能力，支持128k上下文窗口，在多个基准测试中达到同规模模型的最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小型语言模型通常依赖知识蒸馏，缺乏内在的推理和智能体能力，且难以平衡计算效率与复杂任务处理能力。本研究旨在开发一个轻量级但具备原生智能体智能的模型，以证明小型模型也能拥有强大的内在认知能力。

Conclusion: 通过从零开始预训练、精心设计的架构和课程学习策略，轻量级语言模型能够实现高效的推理和规划能力，为资源受限环境下的智能体应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Youtu-LLM, a lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled "Commonsense-STEM-Agent" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多组学研究依赖通路富集分析，但现有方法受限于通路数据库的结构性缺陷（如更新滞后、功能冗余、对分子状态和干预的敏感性有限）。虽然已有研究探索使用大语言模型改进通路富集分析，但缺乏标准化的端到端多组学通路机制阐明基准，阻碍了可重复性进展。

Method: 通过严格的四阶段工作流程构建BIOME-Bench基准，评估大语言模型在多组学分析中的两个核心能力：生物分子相互作用推理和端到端多组学通路机制阐明。开发了针对这两项任务的评估协议，并在多个当代强模型上进行了全面实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有模型在多组学分析中仍存在显著缺陷：难以可靠区分细粒度的生物分子关系类型，也无法生成忠实、稳健的通路层面机制解释。

Conclusion: BIOME-Bench基准的建立揭示了当前大语言模型在多组学分析任务上的局限性，为未来改进模型在生物分子相互作用推理和通路机制阐明方面的能力提供了评估框架和方向。

Abstract: Multi-omics studies often rely on pathway enrichment to interpret heterogeneous molecular changes, but pathway enrichment (PE)-based workflows inherit structural limitations of pathway resources, including curation lag, functional redundancy, and limited sensitivity to molecular states and interventions. Although recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to improve PE-based interpretation, the lack of a standardized benchmark for end-to-end multi-omics pathway mechanism elucidation has largely confined evaluation to small, manually curated datasets or ad hoc case studies, hindering reproducible progress. To address this issue, we introduce BIOME-Bench, constructed via a rigorous four-stage workflow, to evaluate two core capabilities of LLMs in multi-omics analysis: Biomolecular Interaction Inference and end-to-end Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation. We develop evaluation protocols for both tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple strong contemporary models. Experimental results demonstrate that existing models still exhibit substantial deficiencies in multi-omics analysis, struggling to reliably distinguish fine-grained biomolecular relation types and to generate faithful, robust pathway-level mechanistic explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型基准测试存在三个根本局限：易受数据污染影响、仅评估单知识点、依赖昂贵的领域专家标注。需要一种更可靠、全面且成本效益高的评估方法。

Method: 从权威教材提取独立知识陈述作为基本单元，在测试时通过随机抽样动态组合成评估问题（每个问题聚合8-10个陈述），标注者仅需验证格式合规性而无需领域专业知识。

Result: 在50多个大语言模型上的实验显示，Encyclo-K具有强区分能力：最佳模型（OpenAI-GPT-5.1）准确率仅62.07%；推理模型准确率区间为16.04%-62.07%，聊天模型为9.71%-50.40%。

Conclusion: Encyclo-K通过动态评估和多陈述综合理解，建立了可扩展的框架，能有效评估大语言模型对多个细粒度学科知识陈述的综合理解能力。

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.

Abstract: Detecting depression from social media text is still a challenging task. This is due to different language styles, informal expression, and the lack of annotated data in many languages. To tackle these issues, we propose, Semi-SMDNet, a strong Semi-Supervised Multilingual Depression detection Network. It combines teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning, and augmentation of data. Our framework uses a group of teacher models. Their predictions come together through soft voting. An uncertainty-based threshold filters out low-confidence pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve learning stability. We also use a confidence-weighted training method that focuses on reliable pseudo-labelled samples. This greatly boosts robustness across languages. Tests on Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish datasets show that our approach consistently beats strong baselines. It significantly reduces the performance gap between settings that have plenty of resources and those that do not. Detailed experiments and studies confirm that our framework is effective and can be used in various situations. This shows that it is suitable for scalable, cross-language mental health monitoring where labelled resources are limited.

Motivation: 现有超连接方法通过扩展残差流宽度和多样化连接模式提升性能，但破坏了残差连接的恒等映射特性，导致训练不稳定、可扩展性受限和内存访问开销增加。

Method: 提出mHC框架：1）将超连接的残差空间投影到特定流形以恢复恒等映射；2）结合严格的基础设施优化确保效率；3）通过流形约束保持连接多样性同时稳定训练。

Result: 实验证明mHC能有效支持大规模训练，提供显著性能提升和更优的可扩展性，同时减少内存开销。

Conclusion: mHC作为超连接的灵活实用扩展，有助于深化对拓扑架构设计的理解，为基础模型的演进提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are demonstrating rapid improvements on complex reasoning benchmarks, particularly when allowed to utilize intermediate reasoning steps before converging on a final solution. However, current literature often overlooks the significant computational burden associated with generating long reasoning sequences. For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute. Beyond a certain threshold, accuracy gains diminish, indicating that while extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations regarding specific complexities.

### [197] [Triangulation as an Acceptance Rule for Multilingual Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24842)
*Yanan Long*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“三角验证”的因果标准，用于在多语言环境中验证语言模型的机制解释，要求电路在保持语义的变体上同时满足必要性、充分性和不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言模型在整体表现上强劲，但其跨语言、文字和文化的机制行为难以预测且缺乏可靠的因果解释标准。

Method: 引入“参考族”作为保持谓词意义的变体集合，提出三角验证标准（必要性、充分性、跨参考族的不变性），结合自动电路发现与基于因果抽象的干预分布评分。

Result: 三角验证能够过滤掉在单一环境中有效但在跨语言变体中失效的虚假电路，为机制性主张提供了可证伪的标准。

Conclusion: 三角验证通过多环境因果干预与跨语言不变性检验，为多语言模型的机制解释提供了更严谨、可复现的评估框架。

Abstract: Multilingual language models achieve strong aggregate performance yet often behave unpredictably across languages, scripts, and cultures. We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.

TL;DR: 本文提出BEDA框架，通过将信念估计转化为生成约束，实现了战略对话中对抗与对齐行为的可靠执行，在多种对话场景中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽能准确估计对话信念，但缺乏在生成过程中系统利用这些信念的机制，导致战略对话行为执行不充分。

Method: 提出BEDA框架：1) 形式化对抗与对齐两种核心对话行为；2) 通过概率约束将信念估计转化为生成限制；3) 包含世界集合、信念估计器和条件生成器三个组件。

Result: 在CKBG（对抗）、Mutual Friends（合作）、CaSiNo（协商）三个任务中，BEDA均显著优于基线：CKBG任务成功率提升5.0-20.6点；Mutual Friends平均提升9.3点；CaSiNo达成最优协议。

Conclusion: 将信念估计转化为约束条件是一种简单通用的机制，能有效提升战略对话的可靠性，为对话系统提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步LLM管道性能严重依赖各步骤提示，但由于缺乏步骤级监督和步骤间依赖关系，联合优化这些提示非常困难，现有端到端优化方法效果不佳。

Method: ADOPT框架：1）显式建模每个LLM步骤与最终任务结果的依赖关系；2）实现类似解析导数的精确文本梯度估计；3）将文本梯度估计与梯度更新解耦；4）使用基于Shapley值的机制自适应分配优化资源。

Result: 在真实数据集和多样化管道结构上的实验表明，ADOPT有效且鲁棒，持续优于最先进的提示优化基线方法。

Conclusion: ADOPT通过依赖感知的梯度估计和自适应资源分配，成功解决了多步LLM管道提示优化的挑战，为复杂任务提供了可靠的优化框架。

Abstract: Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.

*Chao Peng,Bin Wang,Zhilei Long,Jinfang Sheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出AdaGReS框架，通过结合查询相关性和冗余惩罚的集合级目标，在token预算约束下进行贪婪选择，优化检索增强生成中的上下文质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准top-k检索常返回冗余或近似重复的文本块，浪费token预算并降低下游生成质量，需要更智能的上下文选择方法。

Method: 设计冗余感知的上下文选择框架，使用结合查询-块相关性和集合内冗余惩罚的目标函数，在token预算下进行贪婪选择，并引入自适应校准机制调整相关性与冗余的权衡参数。

Result: 在开放域问答和生物医学语料库上的实验表明，该框架能有效控制冗余、提升上下文质量，从而改善端到端答案质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaGReS通过理论分析和实验验证，为token预算约束下的检索增强生成提供了有效的冗余感知上下文选择方案，无需手动调参即可适应不同数据统计和预算限制。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.

### [203] [Modeling Language as a Sequence of Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25026)
*Nasim Borazjanizadeh,James McClelland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Thought Gestalt模型，一种双层次抽象的循环Transformer，通过句子级“思想”状态提升语言模型的全局一致性和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer主要依赖表层共现统计，缺乏对实体和事件的全局一致潜在表示，导致关系方向泛化脆弱、上下文错误和数据效率低下。受人类认知将语言流转换为紧凑事件表征的启发，研究旨在构建更接近人类理解过程的语言模型。

Method: 设计循环Transformer，在词符和句子级“思想”状态两个抽象层次建模语言。模型逐句生成词符，通过交叉注意力访问历史句子表征记忆。使用同一组参数生成词符和句子表征，仅通过下一词符交叉熵损失训练，梯度通过记忆中的计算图反向传播优化句子向量生成。

Result: 缩放实验中，TG相比匹配的GPT-2基线持续提升效率，拟合曲线表明GPT-2需要增加约5-8%的数据和33-42%的参数才能达到同等损失。在父子关系反转诅咒测试中，TG减少了关系方向泛化错误。

Conclusion: Thought Gestalt模型通过引入持久化的句子级抽象表征，增强了语言模型的全局一致性、数据效率和关系泛化能力，为构建更接近人类认知过程的语言理解系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level "thought" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.

Conclusion: 结合局部传感与物理约束的因子图框架能有效解决触觉感知中的病态问题，提升操作任务中的姿态与接触估计精度。

Abstract: Prehensile autonomous manipulation, such as peg insertion, tool use, or assembly, require precise in-hand understanding of the object pose and the extrinsic contacts made during interactions. Providing accurate estimation of pose and contacts is challenging. Tactile sensors can provide local geometry at the sensor and force information about the grasp, but the locality of sensing means resolving poses and contacts from tactile alone is often an ill-posed problem, as multiple configurations can be consistent with the observations. Adding visual feedback can help resolve ambiguities, but can suffer from noise and occlusions. In this work, we propose a method that pairs local observations from sensing with the physical constraints of contact. We propose a set of factors that ensure local consistency with tactile observations as well as enforcing physical plausibility, namely, that the estimated pose and contacts must respect the kinematic and force constraints of quasi-static rigid body interactions. We formalize our problem as a factor graph, allowing for efficient estimation. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing geometric and contact-informed estimation pipelines, especially when only tactile information is available.

Abstract: This paper introduces SHIELD, a Spherical-Projection Hybrid-Frontier Integration for Efficient LiDAR-based Drone exploration method. Although laser LiDAR offers the advantage of a wide field of view, its application in UAV exploration still faces several challenges. The observation quality of LiDAR point clouds is generally inferior to that of depth cameras. Traditional frontier methods based on known and unknown regions impose a heavy computational burden, especially when handling the wide field of view of LiDAR. In addition, regions without point cloud are also difficult to classify as free space through raycasting. To address these problems, the SHIELD is proposed. It maintains an observation-quality occupancy map and performs ray-casting on this map to address the issue of inconsistent point-cloud quality during exploration. A hybrid frontier method is used to tackle both the computational burden and the limitations of point-cloud quality exploration. In addition, an outward spherical-projection ray-casting strategy is proposed to jointly ensure flight safety and exploration efficiency in open areas. Simulations and flight experiments prove the effectiveness of SHIELD. This work will be open-sourced to contribute to the research community.

Abstract: Significant challenges are posed by simulation and testing in the field of low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) traffic due to the high costs associated with large-scale UAV testing and the complexity of establishing low-altitude traffic test scenarios. Stringent safety requirements make high fidelity one of the key metrics for simulation platforms. Despite advancements in simulation platforms for low-altitude UAVs, there is still a shortage of platforms that feature rich traffic scenarios, high-precision UAV and scenario simulators, and comprehensive testing capabilities for low-altitude traffic. Therefore, this paper introduces an integrated high-fidelity simulation platform for low-altitude UAV traffic. This platform simulates all components of the UAV traffic network, including the control system, the traffic management system, the UAV system, the communication network , the anomaly and fault modules, etc. Furthermore, it integrates RflySim/AirSim and Unreal Engine 5 to develop full-state models of UAVs and 3D maps that model the real world using the oblique photogrammetry technique. Additionally, the platform offers a wide range of interfaces, and all models and scenarios can be customized with a high degree of flexibility. The platform's source code has been released, making it easier to conduct research related to low-altitude traffic.

Abstract: A single service robot can present two distinct agencies: its onboard autonomy and an operator-mediated agency, yet users experience them through one physical body. We formalize this dual-agency structure as a User-Robot-Operator triad in an autonomous remote-control setting that combines autonomous execution with remote human support. Prior to the recent surge of language-based and multimodal interfaces, we developed and evaluated an early-stage prototype in 2020 that combined natural-language text chat with freehand sketch annotations over the robot's live camera view to support remote intervention. We evaluated three modes - autonomous, remote, and hybrid - in controlled fetch-and-carry tasks using a domestic mobile manipulator (HSR) on a World Robot Summit 2020 rule-compliant test field. The results show systematic mode-dependent differences in user-rated affinity and additional insights on perceived security, indicating that switching or blending agency within one robot measurably shapes human impressions. These findings provide empirical guidance for designing human-in-the-loop mobile manipulation in domestic physical tasks.

Conclusion: 理解物理接触对于构建鲁棒的、具备触觉感知能力的机器人智能体至关重要；通过预测未来触觉状态，模型能够获得丰富的接触物理模型，并基于实际观察和想象结果调整行动。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable generalization by mapping web-scale knowledge to robotic control, yet they remain blind to physical contact. Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.

Conclusion: ERIQ与FACT为诊断和解决推理-精度权衡提供了系统框架，推动了鲁棒通用机器人操作的发展。

Abstract: General-purpose robotic systems operating in open-world environments must achieve both broad generalization and high-precision action execution, a combination that remains challenging for existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) improve semantic generalization, insufficient embodied reasoning leads to brittle behavior, and conversely, strong reasoning alone is inadequate without precise control. To provide a decoupled and quantitative assessment of this bottleneck, we introduce Embodied Reasoning Intelligence Quotient (ERIQ), a large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark in robotic manipulation, comprising 6K+ question-answer pairs across four reasoning dimensions. By decoupling reasoning from execution, ERIQ enables systematic evaluation and reveals a strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and end-to-end VLA generalization. To bridge the gap from reasoning to precise execution, we propose FACT, a flow-matching-based action tokenizer that converts continuous control into discrete sequences while preserving high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction. The resulting GenieReasoner jointly optimizes reasoning and action in a unified space, outperforming both continuous-action and prior discrete-action baselines in real-world tasks. Together, ERIQ and FACT provide a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming the reasoning-precision trade-off, advancing robust, general-purpose robotic manipulation.

Abstract: On the way towards full autonomy, sharing roads between automated vehicles and human actors in so-called mixed traffic is unavoidable. Moreover, even if all vehicles on the road were autonomous, pedestrians would still be crossing the streets. We propose social robots as moderators between autonomous vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRU). To this end, we identify four enablers requiring integration: (1) advanced perception, allowing the robot to see the environment; (2) vehicular communications allowing connected vehicles to share intentions and the robot to send guiding commands; (3) social human-robot interaction allowing the robot to effectively communicate with VRUs and drivers; (4) formal specification allowing the robot to understand traffic and plan accordingly. This paper presents an overview of the key enablers and report on a first proof-of-concept integration of the first three enablers envisioning a social robot advising pedestrians in scenarios with a cooperative automated e-bike.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have enabled language-conditioned, long-horizon robot manipulation, but most existing systems are limited to grippers. Scaling VLA policies to bimanual robots with high degree-of-freedom (DoF) dexterous hands remains challenging due to the expanded action space, frequent hand-object occlusions, and the cost of collecting real-robot data. We present GR-Dexter, a holistic hardware-model-data framework for VLA-based generalist manipulation on a bimanual dexterous-hand robot. Our approach combines the design of a compact 21-DoF robotic hand, an intuitive bimanual teleoperation system for real-robot data collection, and a training recipe that leverages teleoperated robot trajectories together with large-scale vision-language and carefully curated cross-embodiment datasets. Across real-world evaluations spanning long-horizon everyday manipulation and generalizable pick-and-place, GR-Dexter achieves strong in-domain performance and improved robustness to unseen objects and unseen instructions. We hope GR-Dexter serves as a practical step toward generalist dexterous-hand robotic manipulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本目标导航方法严重依赖模拟器提供的精确深度和位姿信息，且缺乏上下文学习能力，难以快速适应新环境。

Method: 基于3D基础模型构建框架，包含关键帧3D重建、语义点云生成、视觉语言模型驱动的探索价值估计、自适应航点选择和底层动作执行。

Conclusion: RANGER实现了不依赖深度/位姿的零样本语义导航，通过短视频观察即可提升任务效率，为现实世界具身应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently finding targets in complex environments is fundamental to real-world embodied applications. While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have enabled zero-shot object goal navigation, allowing robots to search for arbitrary objects without fine-tuning, existing methods face two key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on precise depth and pose information provided by simulators, which restricts applicability in real-world scenarios; and (2) lack of in-context learning (ICL) capability, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new environments, as in leveraging short videos. To address these challenges, we propose RANGER, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that operates using only a monocular camera. Leveraging powerful 3D foundation models, RANGER eliminates the dependency on depth and pose while exhibiting strong ICL capability. By simply observing a short video of a new environment, the system can also significantly improve task efficiency without requiring architectural modifications or fine-tuning. The framework integrates several key components: keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, vision-language model (VLM)-driven exploration value estimation, high-level adaptive waypoint selection, and low-level action execution. Experiments on the HM3D benchmark and real-world environments demonstrate that RANGER achieves competitive performance in terms of navigation success rate and exploration efficiency, while showing superior ICL adaptability, with no previous 3D mapping of the environment required.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play an important role in various applications, where precise trajectory tracking is crucial. However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters. Through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to SOTA methods, it improves the position accuracy by 24.7% to 42.9%, and the angular accuracy by 40.9% to 78.4%.

Abstract: Constrained motion planning is a common but challenging problem in robotic manipulation. In recent years, data-driven constrained motion planning algorithms have shown impressive planning speed and success rate. Among them, the latent motion method based on manifold approximation is the most efficient planning algorithm. Due to errors in manifold approximation and the difficulty in accurately identifying collision conflicts within the latent space, time-consuming path validity checks and path replanning are required. In this paper, we propose a method that trains a neural network to predict the minimum distance between the robot and obstacles using latent vectors as inputs. The learned distance gradient is then used to calculate the direction of movement in the latent space to move the robot away from obstacles. Based on this, a local path optimization algorithm in the latent space is proposed, and it is integrated with the path validity checking process to reduce the time of replanning. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in multiple planning scenarios, demonstrating the fastest planning speed

Conclusion: 所提框架通过时序建模与自适应多模态融合，显著提升了无人车在动态环境中的导航性能。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have demonstrated potential for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in crowded environments. Most existing approaches rely on single-frame observation and employ simple concatenation for multi-modal fusion, which limits their ability to capture temporal context and hinders dynamic adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based navigation framework, DRL-TH, which leverages temporal graph attention and hierarchical graph pooling to integrate historical observations and adaptively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a temporal-guided graph attention network (TG-GAT) that incorporates temporal weights into attention scores to capture correlations between consecutive frames, thereby enabling the implicit estimation of scene evolution. In addition, we design a graph hierarchical abstraction module (GHAM) that applies hierarchical pooling and learnable weighted fusion to dynamically integrate RGB and LiDAR features, achieving balanced representation across multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DRL-TH outperforms existing methods in various crowded environments. We also implemented DRL-TH control policy on a real UGV and showed that it performed well in real world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有真实世界强化学习方法通常假设人类干预是最优的，但实际中人类操作者可能提供次优动作或犯错。简单混合干预数据与机器人收集数据会导致样本效率低，而单纯模仿干预数据又会限制最终性能。如何有效利用可能次优且带噪声的人类干预来加速学习而不受其限制，是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 提出SiLRI算法，将在线操作问题建模为约束强化学习优化问题，其中每个状态的约束边界由人类干预的不确定性决定。引入状态依赖的拉格朗日乘子，通过最小-最大优化联合优化策略与拉格朗日乘子，达到鞍点。算法基于人机协同遥操作系统实现。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach to training precise and dexterous robotic manipulation policies in an online manner, enabling robots to learn from their own experience while gradually reducing human labor. However, prior real-world RL methods often assume that human interventions are optimal across the entire state space, overlooking the fact that even expert operators cannot consistently provide optimal actions in all states or completely avoid mistakes. Indiscriminately mixing intervention data with robot-collected data inherits the sample inefficiency of RL, while purely imitating intervention data can ultimately degrade the final performance achievable by RL. The question of how to leverage potentially suboptimal and noisy human interventions to accelerate learning without being constrained by them thus remains open. To address this challenge, we propose SiLRI, a state-wise Lagrangian reinforcement learning algorithm for real-world robot manipulation tasks. Specifically, we formulate the online manipulation problem as a constrained RL optimization, where the constraint bound at each state is determined by the uncertainty of human interventions. We then introduce a state-wise Lagrange multiplier and solve the problem via a min-max optimization, jointly optimizing the policy and the Lagrange multiplier to reach a saddle point. Built upon a human-as-copilot teleoperation system, our algorithm is evaluated through real-world experiments on diverse manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that SiLRI effectively exploits human suboptimal interventions, reducing the time required to reach a 90% success rate by at least 50% compared with the state-of-the-art RL method HIL-SERL, and achieving a 100% success rate on long-horizon manipulation tasks where other RL methods struggle to succeed.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training is fundamental for generalization in language and vision models, but data for dexterous hand manipulation remains limited in scale and diversity, hindering policy generalization. Limited scenario diversity, misaligned modalities, and insufficient benchmarking constrain current human manipulation datasets. To address these gaps, we introduce World In Your Hands (WiYH), a large-scale open-source ecosystem for human-centric manipulation learning. WiYH includes (1) the Oracle Suite, a wearable data collection kit with an auto-labeling pipeline for accurate motion capture; (2) the WiYH Dataset, featuring over 1,000 hours of multi-modal manipulation data across hundreds of skills in diverse real-world scenarios; and (3) extensive annotations and benchmarks supporting tasks from perception to action. Furthermore, experiments based on the WiYH ecosystem show that integrating WiYH's human-centric data significantly enhances the generalization and robustness of dexterous hand policies in tabletop manipulation tasks. We believe that World In Your Hands will bring new insights into human-centric data collection and policy learning to the community.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and flight test results of two novel 3D path-following guidance algorithms based on nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), with specific application to fixed-wing small uncrewed aircraft systems. To enable MPC, control-augmented modelling and system identification of the RAAVEN small uncrewed aircraft is presented. Two formulations of MPC are then showcased. The first schedules a static reference path rate over the MPC horizon, incentivizing a constant inertial speed. The second, with inspiration from model predictive contouring control, dynamically optimizes for the reference path rate over the controller horizon as the system operates. This allows for a weighted tradeoff between path progression and distance from path, two competing objectives in path-following guidance. Both controllers are formulated to operate over general smooth 3D arc-length parameterized curves. The MPC guidance algorithms are flown over several high-curvature test paths, with comparison to a baseline lookahead guidance law. The results showcase the real-world feasibility and superior performance of nonlinear MPC for 3D path-following guidance at ground speeds up to 36 meters per second.

Abstract: Multi-session map merging is crucial for extended autonomous operations in large-scale environments. In this paper, we present GMLD, a learning-based local descriptor framework for large-scale multi-session point cloud map merging that systematically aligns maps collected across different sessions with overlapping regions. The proposed framework employs a keypoint-aware encoder and a plane-based geometric transformer to extract discriminative features for loop closure detection and relative pose estimation. To further improve global consistency, we include inter-session scan matching cost factors in the factor-graph optimization stage. We evaluate our framework on the public datasets, as well as self-collected data from diverse environments. The results show accurate and robust map merging with low error, and the learned features deliver strong performance in both loop closure detection and relative pose estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the automated simulation and reporting pipeline implemented for our autonomous racing stack, ur.autopilot. The backbone of the simulation is based on a high-fidelity model of the vehicle interfaced as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU). The pipeline can execute the software stack and the simulation up to three times faster than real-time, locally or on GitHub for Continuous Integration/- Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). As the most important input of the pipeline, there is a set of running scenarios. Each scenario allows the initialization of the ego vehicle in different initial conditions (position and speed), as well as the initialization of any other configuration of the stack. This functionality is essential to validate efficiently critical modules, like the one responsible for high-speed overtaking maneuvers or localization, which are among the most challenging aspects of autonomous racing. Moreover, we describe how we implemented a fault injection module, capable of introducing sensor delays and perturbations as well as modifying outputs of any node of the stack. Finally, we describe the design of our automated reporting process, aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of the simulation analysis.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have improved the interpretability of end-to-end autonomous driving by generating intermediate reasoning traces. Yet these models primarily describe what they perceive and intend to do, rarely questioning whether their planned actions are safe or appropriate. This work introduces Counterfactual VLA (CF-VLA), a self-reflective VLA framework that enables the model to reason about and revise its planned actions before execution. CF-VLA first generates time-segmented meta-actions that summarize driving intent, and then performs counterfactual reasoning conditioned on both the meta-actions and the visual context. This step simulates potential outcomes, identifies unsafe behaviors, and outputs corrected meta-actions that guide the final trajectory generation. To efficiently obtain such self-reflective capabilities, we propose a rollout-filter-label pipeline that mines high-value scenes from a base (non-counterfactual) VLA's rollouts and labels counterfactual reasoning traces for subsequent training rounds. Experiments on large-scale driving datasets show that CF-VLA improves trajectory accuracy by up to 17.6%, enhances safety metrics by 20.5%, and exhibits adaptive thinking: it only enables counterfactual reasoning in challenging scenarios. By transforming reasoning traces from one-shot descriptions to causal self-correction signals, CF-VLA takes a step toward self-reflective autonomous driving agents that learn to think before they act.

Abstract: 3D meshes are a fundamental representation widely used in computer science and engineering. In robotics, they are particularly valuable because they capture objects in a form that aligns directly with how robots interact with the physical world, enabling core capabilities such as predicting stable grasps, detecting collisions, and simulating dynamics. Although automatic 3D mesh generation methods have shown promising progress in recent years, potentially offering a path toward real-time robot perception, two critical challenges remain. First, generating high-fidelity meshes is prohibitively slow for real-time use, often requiring tens of seconds per object. Second, mesh generation by itself is insufficient. In robotics, a mesh must be contextually grounded, i.e., correctly segmented from the scene and registered with the proper scale and pose. Additionally, unless these contextual grounding steps remain efficient, they simply introduce new bottlenecks. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end system that addresses these challenges, producing a high-quality, contextually grounded 3D mesh from a single RGB-D image in under one second. Our pipeline integrates open-vocabulary object segmentation, accelerated diffusion-based mesh generation, and robust point cloud registration, each optimized for both speed and accuracy. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world manipulation task, showing that it enables meshes to be used as a practical, on-demand representation for robotics perception and planning.

Abstract: The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous and remotely supervised maritime vessels to detect departures from their operational design domain, enter a predefined fallback that notifies the operator, permit immediate human override, and avoid changing the voyage plan without approval. Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained vision-language model (VLM) fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation. These results support VLMs as semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with the draft IMO MASS Code, within practical latency budgets, and motivate future work on domain-adapted, hybrid autonomy that pairs foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor bird's-eye-view perception and short-horizon replanning.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的表面拟合抓取规划算法DISF，通过解耦抓取姿态优化为旋转对齐、平移细化和夹爪开度调整三步，在保持几何兼容性的同时提升接触点分布的稳定性，从而提高抓取成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于表面拟合的抓取规划算法主要关注夹爪与物体表面的几何对齐，但忽略了接触点分布的稳定性，导致因接触配置不佳而产生不稳定抓取。

Method: 受人类抓取行为启发，将抓取姿态优化分解为三个顺序步骤：1）旋转优化以对齐接触法线；2）平移细化以改善夹爪坐标系原点与物体质心的对齐；3）夹爪开度调整以优化接触点分布。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人实验中验证，DISF在保持几何兼容性的同时减少了质心错位，相比基线方法在仿真和真实世界抓取中均获得更高的成功率。

Conclusion: 所提出的DISF算法通过整合接触稳定性到表面拟合过程中，有效解决了传统方法因忽略接触配置而导致的抓取不稳定问题，提升了抓取性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the limitation of surface fitting-based grasp planning algorithm, which primarily focuses on geometric alignment between the gripper and object surface while overlooking the stability of contact point distribution, often resulting in unstable grasps due to inadequate contact configurations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel surface fitting algorithm that integrates contact stability while preserving geometric compatibility. Inspired by human grasping behavior, our method disentangles the grasp pose optimization into three sequential steps: (1) rotation optimization to align contact normals, (2) translation refinement to improve the alignment between the gripper frame origin and the object Center of Mass (CoM), and (3) gripper aperture adjustment to optimize contact point distribution. We validate our approach in simulation across 15 objects under both Known-shape (with clean CAD-derived dataset) and Observed-shape (with YCB object dataset) settings, including cross-platform grasp execution on three robot--gripper platforms. We further validate the method in real-world grasp experiments on a UR3e robot. Overall, DISF reduces CoM misalignment while maintaining geometric compatibility, translating into higher grasp success in both simulation and real-world execution compared to baselines.

TL;DR: 提出PAM（自适应工作记忆的视觉运动策略），通过两阶段训练支持300帧历史窗口，解决机器人操作中的状态模糊问题，同时保持高推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作中常见状态模糊问题——相同观测可能对应多个有效行为轨迹。现有方法简单扩展历史窗口会导致计算成本高和过拟合，需要更高效的历史信息提取机制。

Method: 1. 分层帧特征提取器生成运动基元和时序消歧两种表示；2. 使用带范围特定查询的上下文路由器生成紧凑的跨历史长度上下文特征；3. 引入历史信息重建的辅助目标确保路由器作为有效瓶颈；4. 两阶段训练最小化额外成本。

Result: 在精心设计的7个任务中验证PAM能同时处理多种状态模糊场景，支持约10秒历史窗口（300帧），保持稳定训练且推理速度高于20Hz。

Conclusion: PAM通过自适应工作记忆机制有效解决了长历史窗口下的状态模糊问题，在保持实时性能的同时显著提升了策略的时序推理能力。

Abstract: State ambiguity is common in robotic manipulation. Identical observations may correspond to multiple valid behavior trajectories. The visuomotor policy must correctly extract the appropriate types and levels of information from the history to identify the current task phase. However, naively extending the history window is computationally expensive and may cause severe overfitting. Inspired by the continuous nature of human reasoning and the recoding of working memory, we introduce PAM, a novel visuomotor Policy equipped with Adaptive working Memory. With minimal additional training cost in a two-stage manner, PAM supports a 300-frame history window while maintaining high inference speed. Specifically, a hierarchical frame feature extractor yields two distinct representations for motion primitives and temporal disambiguation. For compact representation, a context router with range-specific queries is employed to produce compact context features across multiple history lengths. And an auxiliary objective of reconstructing historical information is introduced to ensure that the context router acts as an effective bottleneck. We meticulously design 7 tasks and verify that PAM can handle multiple scenarios of state ambiguity simultaneously. With a history window of approximately 10 seconds, PAM still supports stable training and maintains inference speeds above 20Hz. Project website: https://tinda24.github.io/pam/

Conclusion: 全局路径引导与语义感知局部控制的结合，能显著提升自主机器人在复杂人机共存环境中的导航安全性与可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots operating in complex, dynamic environments face the dual challenge of navigating large-scale, structurally diverse spaces with static obstacles while safely interacting with various moving agents. Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.

Abstract: Humanoid robots toward human-level dexterity require robotic hands capable of simultaneously providing high grasping force, rapid actuation speeds, multiple degrees of freedom, and lightweight structures within human-like size constraints. Meeting these conflicting requirements remains challenging, as satisfying this combination typically necessitates heavier actuators and bulkier transmission systems, significantly restricting the payload capacity of robot arms. In this letter, we present a lightweight anthropomorphic hand actuated by Bowden cables, which uniquely combines rolling-contact joint optimization with antagonistic cable actuation, enabling single-motor-per-joint control with negligible cable-length deviation. By relocating the actuator module to the torso, the design substantially reduces distal mass while maintaining anthropomorphic scale and dexterity. Additionally, this antagonistic cable actuation eliminates the need for synchronization between motors. Using the proposed methods, the hand assembly with a distal mass of 236g (excluding remote actuators and Bowden sheaths) demonstrated reliable execution of dexterous tasks, exceeding 18N fingertip force and lifting payloads over one hundred times its own mass. Furthermore, robustness was validated through Cutkosky taxonomy grasps and trajectory consistency under perturbed actuator-hand transformations.

Abstract: While data-driven imitation learning has revolutionized robotic manipulation, current approaches remain constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse real-world demonstrations. Consequently, the ability of existing models to generalize across long-horizon bimanual tasks and mobile manipulation in unstructured environments remains limited. To bridge this gap, we present RoboMIND 2.0, a comprehensive real-world dataset comprising over 310K dual-arm manipulation trajectories collected across six distinct robot embodiments and 739 complex tasks. Crucially, to support research in contact-rich and spatially extended tasks, the dataset incorporates 12K tactile-enhanced episodes and 20K mobile manipulation trajectories. Complementing this physical data, we construct high-fidelity digital twins of our real-world environments, releasing an additional 20K-trajectory simulated dataset to facilitate robust sim-to-real transfer. To fully exploit the potential of RoboMIND 2.0, we propose MIND-2 system, a hierarchical dual-system frame-work optimized via offline reinforcement learning. MIND-2 integrates a high-level semantic planner (MIND-2-VLM) to decompose abstract natural language instructions into grounded subgoals, coupled with a low-level Vision-Language-Action executor (MIND-2-VLA), which generates precise, proprioception-aware motor actions.

Abstract: Target search and tracking (SAT) is a fundamental problem for various robotic applications such as search and rescue and environmental exploration. This paper proposes an informative trajectory planning approach, namely ReSPIRe, for SAT in unknown cluttered environments under considerably inaccurate prior target information and limited sensing field of view. We first develop a novel sigma point-based approximation approach to fast and accurately estimate mutual information reward under non-Gaussian belief distributions, utilizing informative sampling in state and observation spaces to mitigate the computational intractability of integral calculation. To tackle significant uncertainty associated with inadequate prior target information, we propose the hierarchical particle structure in ReSPIRe, which not only extracts critical particles for global route guidance, but also adjusts the particle number adaptively for planning efficiency. Building upon the hierarchical structure, we develop the reusable belief tree search approach to build a policy tree for online trajectory planning under uncertainty, which reuses rollout evaluation to improve planning efficiency. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that ReSPIRe outperforms representative benchmark methods with smaller MI approximation error, higher search efficiency, and more stable tracking performance, while maintaining outstanding computational efficiency.

Abstract: An important function of autonomous microrobots is the ability to perform robust movement over terrain. This paper explores an edge ML approach to microrobot locomotion, allowing for on-device, lower latency control under compute, memory, and power constraints. This paper explores the locomotion of a sub-centimeter quadrupedal microrobot via reinforcement learning (RL) and deploys the resulting controller on an ultra-small system-on-chip (SoC), SC$μ$M-3C, featuring an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller running at 5 MHz. We train a compact FP32 multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy with two hidden layers ($[128, 64]$) in a massively parallel GPU simulation and enhance robustness by utilizing domain randomization over simulation parameters. We then study integer (Int8) quantization (per-tensor and per-feature) to allow for higher inference update rates on our resource-limited hardware, and we connect hardware power budgets to achievable update frequency via a cycles-per-update model for inference on our Cortex-M0. We propose a resource-aware gait scheduling viewpoint: given a device power budget, we can select the gait mode (trot/intermediate/gallop) that maximizes expected RL reward at a corresponding feasible update frequency. Finally, we deploy our MLP policy on a real-world large-scale robot on uneven terrain, qualitatively noting that domain-randomized training can improve out-of-distribution stability. We do not claim real-world large-robot empirical zero-shot transfer in this work.

Conclusion: CREPES-X框架通过硬件-算法协同设计，实现了无需全局信息的高效多机器人相对定位，为复杂环境下的自主机器人协作提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Relative localization is critical for cooperation in autonomous multi-robot systems. Existing approaches either rely on shared environmental features or inertial assumptions or suffer from non-line-of-sight degradation and outliers in complex environments. Robust and efficient fusion of inter-robot measurements such as bearings, distances, and inertials for tens of robots remains challenging. We present CREPES-X (Cooperative RElative Pose Estimation System with multiple eXtended features), a hierarchical relative localization framework that enhances speed, accuracy, and robustness under challenging conditions, without requiring any global information. CREPES-X starts with a compact hardware design: InfraRed (IR) LEDs, an IR camera, an ultra-wideband module, and an IMU housed in a cube no larger than 6cm on each side. Then CREPES-X implements a two-stage hierarchical estimator to meet different requirements, considering speed, accuracy, and robustness. First, we propose a single-frame relative estimator that provides instant relative poses for multi-robot setups through a closed-form solution and robust bearing outlier rejection. Then a multi-frame relative estimator is designed to offer accurate and robust relative states by exploring IMU pre-integration via robocentric relative kinematics with loosely- and tightly-coupled optimization. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of CREPES-X, showing robustness to up to 90% bearing outliers, proving resilience in challenging conditions, and achieving RMSE of 0.073m and 1.817° in real-world datasets.

Abstract: Generating dynamic motions for legged robots remains a challenging problem. While reinforcement learning has achieved notable success in various legged locomotion tasks, producing highly dynamic behaviors often requires extensive reward tuning or high-quality demonstrations. Leveraging reduced-order models can help mitigate these challenges. However, the model discrepancy poses a significant challenge when transferring policies to full-body dynamics environments. In this work, we introduce a continuation-based learning framework that combines simplified model pretraining and model homotopy transfer to efficiently generate and refine complex dynamic behaviors. First, we pretrain the policy using a single rigid body model to capture core motion patterns in a simplified environment. Next, we employ a continuation strategy to progressively transfer the policy to the full-body environment, minimizing performance loss. To define the continuation path, we introduce a model homotopy from the single rigid body model to the full-body model by gradually redistributing mass and inertia between the trunk and legs. The proposed method not only achieves faster convergence but also demonstrates superior stability during the transfer process compared to baseline methods. Our framework is validated on a range of dynamic tasks, including flips and wall-assisted maneuvers, and is successfully deployed on a real quadrupedal robot.

Conclusion: 语言引导的潜在分类为自动驾驶语义安全监控提供了高效可部署的机制，平衡了语义理解能力与实时性需求。

Abstract: Real-world autonomous driving must adhere to complex human social rules that extend beyond legally codified traffic regulations. Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.

Yet, it remains a challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation.

Abstract: 3D scene graphs have empowered robots with semantic understanding for navigation and planning, yet they often lack the functional information required for physical manipulation, particularly regarding articulated objects. Existing approaches for inferring articulation mechanisms from static observations are prone to visual ambiguity, while methods that estimate parameters from state changes typically rely on constrained settings such as fixed cameras and unobstructed views. Furthermore, fine-grained functional elements like small handles are frequently missed by general object detectors. To bridge this gap, we present ArtiSG, a framework that constructs functional 3D scene graphs by encoding human demonstrations into structured robotic memory. Our approach leverages a robust articulation data collection pipeline utilizing a portable setup to accurately estimate 6-DoF articulation trajectories and axes even under camera ego-motion. We integrate these kinematic priors into a hierarchical and open-vocabulary graph while utilizing interaction data to discover inconspicuous functional elements missed by visual perception. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that ArtiSG significantly outperforms baselines in functional element recall and articulation estimation precision. Moreover, we show that the constructed graph serves as a reliable functional memory that effectively guides robots to perform language-directed manipulation tasks in real-world environments containing diverse articulated objects.

Abstract: Deformable linear objects (DLOs) manipulation presents significant challenges due to DLOs' inherent high-dimensional state space and complex deformation dynamics. The wide-populated obstacles in realistic workspaces further complicate DLO manipulation, necessitating efficient deformation planning and robust deformation tracking. In this work, we propose a novel framework for DLO manipulation in constrained environments. This framework combines hierarchical deformation planning with neural tracking, ensuring reliable performance in both global deformation synthesis and local deformation tracking. Specifically, the deformation planner begins by generating a spatial path set that inherently satisfies the homotopic constraints associated with DLO keypoint paths. Next, a path-set-guided optimization method is applied to synthesize an optimal temporal deformation sequence for the DLO. In manipulation execution, a neural model predictive control approach, leveraging a data-driven deformation model, is designed to accurately track the planned DLO deformation sequence. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in extensive constrained DLO manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold great promise for operating in human-centric environments, yet achieving robust whole-body coordination across the head, hands, and legs remains a major challenge. We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Non-terrestrial base stations (NTBSs), including high-altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and hot-air balloons (HABs), are integral to next-generation wireless networks, offering coverage in remote areas and enhancing capacity in dense regions. In this paper, we propose a distributed beamforming framework for a massive MIMO network with a constellation of aerial platform stations (APSs). Our approach leverages an entropy-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, where each APS operates as an independent agent using imperfect channel state information (CSI) in both training and testing phases. Unlike conventional methods, our model does not require CSI sharing among APSs, significantly reducing overhead. Simulations results demonstrate that our method outperforms zero forcing (ZF) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT) techniques, particularly in high-interference scenarios, while remaining robust to CSI imperfections. Additionally, our framework exhibits scalability, maintaining stable performance over an increasing number of users and various cluster configurations. Therefore, the proposed method holds promise for dynamic and interference-rich NTBS networks, advancing scalable and robust wireless solutions.

Abstract: Neural networks have become a dominant computational workload across cloud and edge platforms, but rapid growth in model size and deployment diversity has exposed hardware bottlenecks increasingly dominated by memory movement, communication, and irregular operators rather than peak arithmetic throughput. This survey reviews the technology landscape for hardware acceleration of deep learning, spanning GPUs and tensor-core architectures; domain-specific accelerators (e.g., TPUs/NPUs); FPGA-based designs; ASIC inference engines; and emerging LLM-serving accelerators such as LPUs (language processing units), alongside in-/near-memory computing and neuromorphic/analog approaches. We organize the space using a unified taxonomy across (i) workloads (CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers/LLMs), (ii) execution settings (training vs.\ inference; datacenter vs.\ edge), and (iii) optimization levers (reduced precision, sparsity and pruning, operator fusion, compilation and scheduling, and memory-system/interconnect design). We synthesize key architectural ideas including systolic arrays, vector and SIMD engines, specialized attention and softmax kernels, quantization-aware datapaths, and high-bandwidth memory, and we discuss how software stacks and compilers bridge model semantics to hardware. Finally, we highlight open challenges -- including efficient long-context LLM inference (KV-cache management), robust support for dynamic and sparse workloads, energy- and security-aware deployment, and fair benchmarking -- and point to promising directions for the next generation of neural acceleration.

Abstract: This paper investigates the economic and technical feasibility of integrating Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology in the Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) sector. These often-idling assets, with their substantial battery capacities, present a unique opportunity to participate in energy markets, providing grid services and generating additional revenue. A novel methodology is introduced that integrates Bayesian Optimization (BO) to optimize the energy infrastructure together with an operating strategy optimization to reduce the electricity costs while enhancing grid interaction.

However, the study is limited by the availability of real-world data on the usage of electric NRMM and does not address regulatory challenges of V2G. Further research is needed to extend the model accuracy and validate these findings.

TL;DR: 提出一种能量感知弹性分割计算算法，通过动态任务卸载实现资源受限节点的持续感知，解决AIoT在荒野监测中的可用性缺口问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荒野监测（如盗猎监视、森林火灾检测）需要大规模部署免维护、无电池的AIoT节点，但传统间歇操作模式会导致节点在能量缓冲期间休眠，从而错过转瞬即逝的关键事件，形成'可用性缺口'。

Method: 设计能量感知弹性分割计算算法，通过动态将计算任务卸载到能量充足的相邻节点，优先保障持续感知能力，而非单纯追求计算吞吐量。

Result: 初步实验表明，该方法能稳定监测额外2496平方米区域，每天多捕获约103个关键事件。

Conclusion: 该算法为在资源受限节点上构建弹性、故障安全的监测系统奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Wilderness monitoring tasks, such as poaching surveillance and forest fire detection, require pervasive and high-accuracy sensing. While AIoT offers a promising path, covering vast, inaccessible regions necessitates the massive deployment of maintenance-free, battery-less nodes with limited computational resources. However, these constraints create a critical `Availability Gap.' Conventional intermittent operations prioritize computation throughput, forcing sensors to sleep during energy buffering. Consequently, systems miss ephemeral, `now-or-never' events (e.g., Vocalizations of natural monuments or Fire), which is fatal for detecting rare but high-stakes anomalies. To address this, we propose an Energy-aware Elastic Split Computing Algorithm that prioritizes continuous sensing by dynamically offloading tasks to energy-rich neighbors. Preliminary results demonstrate stable monitoring of an additional $2,496\;\text{m}^2$ and the capture of approximately 103 more critical events per day. Ultimately, this algorithm establishes a robust foundation for building resilient, fail-safe surveillance systems even on resource-constrained nodes.

Abstract: DC microgrids provide an efficient framework for the interconnection of DC distributed energy resources (DERs) and DC loads. To continue to supply legacy single-phase AC loads, DC/AC converters can be integrated in the DC microgrid. The oscillatory instantaneous power of the single-phase AC load translates into a harmonic current on the converter's DC side, which increases the losses and causes unwanted voltage harmonics in the DC microgrid. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid voltage and current control method (HCM) for DERs. This scheme consists of an inner current control loop and an outer control layer which determines the reference for the inner loop. The outer control layer combines the DC voltage control loop with an output harmonic current control loop. This hybrid structure enables simultaneous regulation of the DC components of the DER output voltage and control of the harmonic component of the DER output current in accordance with the local single-phase AC load's demand. Frequency-domain analysis of the proposed method is presented to demonstrate the DC voltage and harmonic current loops are decoupled and there is no unwanted interaction between them. Additionally, time-domain response of the proposed scheme is validated through hardware-in-the-loop test results.

Motivation: 针对小型海洋机器人和表面船舶在强环境扰动（风、浪、流）下导航时，需要同时保证安全性、鲁棒性和计算效率的挑战，特别是在计算资源有限的情况下。

Method: 采用滑模控制（SMC）处理匹配扰动，高阶控制屏障函数（HOCBF）确保避障约束的前向不变性，结合快速半空间投影方法在需要时调整控制，减少抖振。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该框架在非线性海洋平台模型上实现了鲁棒导航、保证避障，且计算效率高，适合实时嵌入式应用。

Conclusion: SMC-HOCBF框架是安全关键控制的强有力候选方案，特别适用于计算资源有限的小型海洋机器人。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel safe control framework that integrates Sliding Mode Control (SMC), High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) with state-dependent adaptiveness and a lightweight projection for collision-free navigation of an over-actuated 3-DOF marine surface vessel subjected to strong environmental disturbances (wind, waves, and current). SMC provides robustness to matched disturbances common in marine operations, while HOCBFs enforce forward invariance of obstacle-avoidance constraints. A fast half-space projection method adjusts the SMC control only when needed, preserving robustness and minimizing chattering. The approach is evaluated on a nonlinear marine platform model that includes added mass, hydrodynamic damping, and full thruster allocation. Simulation results show robust navigation, guaranteed obstacle avoidance, and computational efficiency suitable for real-time embedded use. For small marine robots and surface vessels with limited onboard computational resources-where execution speed and computational efficiency are critical-the SMC-HOCBF framework constitutes a strong candidate for safety-critical control.

Abstract: A systematic method for the design of linear residual generators for combined fault detection and estimation in nonlinear systems is developed. The proposed residual generator is a linear functional observer built for an extended system that incorporates the fault dynamics from a linear exo-system, and in addition possesses disturbance-decoupling properties. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such residual generators for nonlinear systems are derived. As long as these conditions are satisfied, we obtain explicit design formulas for the residual generator. The results are illustrated through a chemical reactor case study, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文研究了动态乘子对Lurye系统稳定性和性能的保证作用，证明了乘子可以量化闭环功率增益，并探讨了在周期激励下保证唯一周期解的条件和限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态乘子能保证斜率受限非线性Lurye系统的稳定性，但无法保证系统具有有限增量增益，且对噪声敏感性和周期激励下的响应特性缺乏理论保证。

Method: 采用动态乘子理论，结合稳态偏置项分析功率增益，并重新审视一类能保证唯一周期解的乘子，利用经典工具推导其形式，分析相位限制和适用条件。

Result: 证明动态乘子可量化闭环功率增益（需非线性非奇函数），在恒定外信号下能降低系统对噪声的敏感性；但周期激励下可能产生次谐波或混沌响应，特定乘子类可保证唯一、吸引且保周期的解。

Conclusion: 动态乘子能有效保证Lurye系统的功率增益和噪声鲁棒性，但其对周期解的保证受限于相位特性，且仅当圆判据同时适用时才能覆盖全频率范围，这与增量稳定性的已知结论一致。

Abstract: Dynamic multipliers can be used to guarantee the stability of Lurye systems with slope-restricted nonlinearities, but give no guarantee that the closed-loop system has finite incremental gain. We show that multipliers guarantee the closed-loop power gain to be bounded and quantifiable. Power may be measured about an appropriate steady state bias term, provided the multiplier does not require the nonlinearity to be odd. Hence dynamic multipliers can be used to guarantee such Lurye systems have low sensitivity to noise, provided other exogenous signals have constant steady state. For periodic excitation, the closed-loop response can apparently have a subharmonic or chaotic response. We revisit a class of multipliers that can guarantee a unique, attractive and period-preserving solution. We show the multipliers can be derived using classical tools and reconsider assumptions required for their application. Their phase limitations are inherited from those of discrete-time multipliers. The multipliers cannot be used at all frequencies unless the circle criterion can also be applied; this is consistent with known results about dynamic multipliers and incremental stability.

Conclusion: EB-CBFs能够有效利用高斯过程学习到的哈密顿结构，为动力学系统提供概率能量安全保证，同时最小化对名义控制器的干扰。

Abstract: We study safe control for dynamical systems whose continuous-time dynamics are learned with Gaussian processes (GPs), focusing on mechanical and port-Hamiltonian systems where safety is naturally expressed via energy constraints. The availability of a GP Hamiltonian posterior naturally raises the question of how to systematically exploit this structure to design an energy-aware control barrier function with high-probability safety guarantees. We address this problem by developing a Bayesian-CBF framework and instantiating it with energy-aware Bayesian-CBFs (EB-CBFs) that construct conservative energy-based barriers directly from the Hamiltonian and vector-field posteriors, yielding safety filters that minimally modify a nominal controller while providing probabilistic energy safety guarantees. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring system demonstrate that the proposed EB-CBFs achieve high-probability safety under noisy sampled GP-learned dynamics.

Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出一种基于博弈论的时间-频率无遗憾跳频算法，用于解决汽车FMCW雷达间的相互干扰问题，通过联合优化频谱和时间资源分配，显著提升信干噪比和距离-多普勒分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车FMCW雷达密度增加导致相互干扰风险加剧，现有干扰抑制技术在可扩展性、侧信道通信依赖或分辨率损失等方面存在局限，需要一种能同时适应频谱和时间资源的去中心化解决方案。

Method: 将干扰避免问题建模为重复反协调博弈，每个雷达通过遗憾最小化动态自主更新频率子带和啁啾级时间偏移的混合策略，提出时间-频率无遗憾跳频算法，理论分析其在联合域的遗憾边界。

Result: 算法实现外部遗憾和交换遗憾趋近于零，经验博弈收敛至ε-粗相关均衡或相关均衡；数值实验显示相比随机跳频和集中式纳什基准，在多雷达场景中信干噪比、碰撞率和距离-多普勒质量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过时间自适应隐式正则化频率选择，增强了对异步干扰的鲁棒性，为高密度雷达网络提供了一种可扩展、去中心化的干扰协调方案。

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars are indispensable to modern ADAS and autonomous-driving systems, but their increasing density has intensified the risk of mutual interference. Existing mitigation techniques, including reactive receiver-side suppression, proactive waveform design, and cooperative scheduling, often face limitations in scalability, reliance on side-channel communication, or degradation of range-Doppler resolution. Building on our earlier work on decentralized Frequency-Domain No-Regret hopping, this paper introduces a unified time-frequency game-theoretic framework that enables radars to adapt across both spectral and temporal resources. We formulate the interference-avoidance problem as a repeated anti-coordination game, in which each radar autonomously updates a mixed strategy over frequency subbands and chirp-level time offsets using regret-minimization dynamics. We show that the proposed Time-Frequency No-Regret Hopping algorithm achieves vanishing external and swap regret, and that the induced empirical play converges to an $\varepsilon$-coarse correlated equilibrium or a correlated equilibrium. Theoretical analysis provides regret bounds in the joint domain, revealing how temporal adaptation implicitly regularizes frequency selection and enhances robustness against asynchronous interference. Numerical experiments with multi-radar scenarios demonstrate substantial improvements in SINR, collision rate, and range-Doppler quality compared with time-frequency random hopping and centralized Nash-based benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Ring-LWE加密的线性动态控制器高效实现方法，通过系统理论方法显著降低了递归乘法的计算和存储复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加密控制器在递归乘法运算中存在时间和空间复杂度高的问题，需要更高效的实现方案以提升加密控制器的实用性。

Method: 1. 将控制器状态矩阵转换为有理标准形式，利用其稀疏和循环结构仅加密非平凡列；2. 提出输入输出矩阵的'打包'方法，将矩阵编码为单个多项式；3. 基于Ring-LWE密码系统实现同态运算优化。

Abstract: This paper aims to provide an efficient implementation of encrypted linear dynamic controllers that perform recursive multiplications on a Ring-Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) based cryptosystem. By adopting a system-theoretical approach, we significantly reduce both time and space complexities, particularly the number of homomorphic operations required for recursive multiplications. Rather than encrypting the entire state matrix of a given controller, the state matrix is transformed into its rational canonical form, whose sparse and circulant structure enables that encryption and computation are required only on its nontrivial columns. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to ``pack'' each of the input and the output matrices into a single polynomial, thereby reducing the number of homomorphic operations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design enables a remarkably fast implementation of encrypted controllers.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出并评估了一种集成废物发电与AI数据中心配置，将冷却作为首要能源服务而非电力负担，通过能量品位匹配实现热电联产，为电网压力下的城市AI走廊提供选址可行性条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI数据中心的扩张受到可供电力和散热（冷却）能力的双重制约，需要寻找可持续的能源解决方案以缓解电网压力。

Method: 采用输入输出'黑箱'模型，通过能量品位匹配机制，利用低品位废热驱动吸收式冷却替代传统机械制冷，建立可计算原型（LCOC）和ESG评估通道。

Result: 热经济优势取决于三个关键因素：冷却对IT热负荷的覆盖率、传输与辅助设备的寄生电力消耗、距离驱动的能量衰减；研究确定了净效益消失的临界距离走廊。

Conclusion: 该框架为电网压力下的城市AI走廊中废物发电与AI数据中心的耦合提供了选址可行性条件，无需重新推导全生命周期清单即可实现决策支持。

Abstract: AI data-center expansion is increasingly constrained by the coupled availability of deliverable electricity and heat-rejection (cooling) capacity. We propose and evaluate an integrated Waste-to-Energy-AI Data Center configuration that treats cooling as a first-class energy service rather than an unavoidable electricity burden. The coupled system is modeled as an input-output 'black box' with transparent boundaries and a standalone benchmark in which mechanical chilling is powered by grid electricity. The central mechanism is energy-grade matching: low-grade WtE thermal output drives absorption cooling to deliver chilled service, thereby displacing baseline cooling electricity. We show that thermoeconomic superiority is governed by three first-order determinants, (i) cooling coverage of IT heat load, (ii) parasitic electricity for transport and auxiliaries, and (iii) distance-driven delivery decay, yielding a break-even corridor beyond which net benefits vanish. Comparative statics characterize sensitivity to IT utilization, feedstock quality (waste LHV and throughput), climate parameterization, and corridor distance. We translate these accounting gains into decision language through a computable prototype for Levelized Cost of Computing (LCOC) and an ESG valuation channel grounded in measurable mechanisms, without re-deriving full lifecycle inventories. The framework provides siting-ready feasibility conditions for WtE-AIDC coupling in urban AI corridors under grid stress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模多智能体系统在资源受限的有向网络中需要通信高效的精确平均共识算法，现有方法通常需要无限精度或渐进比特增加，难以在严格比特预算下保证性能

Method: 集成Push-Pull（盈余）共识动态与结合缩放和中点偏移的动态量化框架，采用完全分布式同步有限时间终止机制检测ε收敛

Result: PP-ACDC在任何强连通有向图上实现渐近精确平均共识，在有限迭代次数内检测到ε收敛，数值模拟验证其在严格比特预算下的可靠性和通信效率

Conclusion: PP-ACDC算法适用于大规模资源受限的多智能体系统，在定向网络上实现精确平均共识，为有限通信资源下的分布式计算提供有效解决方案

Abstract: This paper proposes a deterministic distributed algorithm, referred to as PP-ACDC, that achieves exact average consensus over possibly unbalanced directed graphs using only a fixed and a priori specified number of quantization bits. The method integrates Push-Pull (surplus) consensus dynamics with a dynamic quantization framing scheme combining zooming and midpoint shifting, enabling agents to preserve the true global average while progressively refining their quantization precision. We establish a rigorous convergence theory showing that PP-ACDC achieves asymptotic (exact) average consensus on any strongly connected digraph under appropriately chosen quantization parameters. Moreover, we develop a fully distributed and synchronized finite-time termination mechanism, and we provide a formal proof on the detection of $ε$-convergence to the average within a finite number of iterations. Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate that PP-ACDC achieves reliable, communication-efficient, and precise average consensus even under very tight bit budgets, underscoring its suitability for large-scale and resource-constrained multi-agent systems operating over directed networks.

Motivation: 异构多智能体系统中存在的不同通信延迟会阻碍相邻节点间的即时信息传递，严重降低标准分布式控制方案的性能，因此需要开发能够补偿这些延迟的控制方法。

Conclusion: 提出的预测框架能有效补偿异构多智能体系统中的通信延迟，实现输出同步，并在大规模流行病控制中展现出显著的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the output synchronization problem for discrete-time heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to distinct communication delays. The presence of such delays prevents the instantaneous delivery of information from neighboring nodes, thereby severely degrading the performance of standard distributed control schemes. To overcome this, we propose a prediction-based framework for exact delay compensation. Specifically, we introduce predictors combined with a mechanism of distributed predictors, which enables the recursive reconstruction of future state information across the communication network. Building upon these predictors, we construct prediction-based distributed observers and formulate both prediction-based distributed state-feedback and dynamic output-feedback controllers. Theoretical analysis confirms that the proposed strategy eliminates the impact of delays after a finite number of steps, ensuring output synchronization. The effectiveness of the methods is validated through a numerical example and a Koopman operator-based linear Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model. Notably, for a population of 4 million, the proposed delay compensation strategy achieves a reduction of over 200,000 infected individuals at the peak, underscoring its potential significance in epidemic mitigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测性维护需要准确的异常检测和可信的解释，但研究发现简单的多模态融合策略可能反而降低性能，因此需要更有效的融合方法。

Method: 采用级联框架：第一阶段使用基于LSTM的传感器编码器进行检测，第二阶段激活基于CNN的热成像编码器进行故障定位，并集成SHAP、时空注意力等可解释性分析。

Result: 传感器单独检测的F1分数为93.08%，优于完全融合的84.79%；发现融合模型存在模态偏差，将65-87%的权重分配给较弱的热成像模态。

Conclusion: 级联方法在真实轴承数据集上实现了最先进的准确率，同时提供了可操作的诊断信息，证明了检测与定位解耦策略的有效性。

Abstract: Predictive maintenance demands accurate anomaly detection and trustable explanations. Although multimodal fusion of sensor time-series and thermal imagery shows promise, we demonstrate that naive fusion strategies can paradoxically degrade performance. This paper introduces a Cascaded Anomaly Detection framework that decouples detection and localization. Stage 1 employs an LSTM-based sensor encoder with temporal attention for high-accuracy detection, while Stage 2 activates a CNN-based thermal encoder for post-detection fault localization. Our results reveal that sensor-only detection outperforms full fusion by 8.3 percentage points (93.08% vs. 84.79% F1-score), challenging the assumption that additional modalities invariably improve performance. We further contribute an explainability pipeline integrating SHAP, temporal/spatial attention, and gate weight analysis. This analysis uncovers a "modality bias" where fusion models assign 65-87% weight to the weaker thermal modality. Validated on a real-world bearing dataset (78,397 samples), our cascaded approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing actionable diagnostics for maintenance decision-making.

Abstract: Multi-agent target tracking in the presence of nonlinear dynamics and agent heterogeneity, where state-space dimensions may differ, is a challenging problem that traditional graph Laplacian methods cannot easily address. This work leverages the framework of cellular sheaves, a mathematical generalization of graph theory, to natively model such heterogeneous systems. While existing coordination sheaf frameworks focus on cooperative problems like consensus, this work extends them to the non-cooperative target-tracking problem. The tracking of multiple, unknown targets is formulated as a harmonic extension problem on a cellular sheaf, accommodating nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances for all agents. A decentralized control law is developed using the sheaf Laplacian, and a corresponding Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee tracking error convergence, with results validated by simulation.

Conclusion: 该硬件需求极低的方法为普通用户提供了实现高质量高速增材制造的可及性方案，无需复杂设置即可提升标准3D打印机性能。

Abstract: Off-the-shelf fused filament fabrication 3D printers are widely accessible and convenient, yet they exhibit quality loss at high speeds due to dynamic mis-synchronization between printhead motion and material extrusion systems, notably corner over-extrusion. Existing methods require specialized hardware, extensive calibration, or firmware modifications that are inaccessible to most users. This work presents a practical, end-to-end optimization framework that enhances high-speed printing using only standard 3D printers and a phone camera, without requiring additional complex setup. The method employs a one-shot calibration approach in which two simple printed patterns, captured by a phone camera, enable identification of extrusion dynamics and cornering behavior. The identified systems enable a model-based constrained optimal control strategy that generates optimized G-code, synchronizing motion and extrusion. Experiments show reduced width tracking error, mitigated corner defects, and lower surface roughness, achieving surface quality at 3600 mm/min comparable to conventional printing at 1600 mm/min, effectively doubling production speed while maintaining print quality. This accessible, hardware-minimal approach enables a wide range of fused filament fabrication users to achieve high-quality, high-speed additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are one of the most devastating climate change induced hazards. Existing remote monitoring approaches often prioritise maximising spatial coverage to train generalistic models or rely on optical imagery hampered by persistent cloud coverage. This paper presents an end-to-end, automated deep learning pipeline for the targeted monitoring of high-risk Himalayan glacial lakes using time-series Sentinel-1 SAR. We introduce a "temporal-first" training strategy, utilising a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B3 backbone trained on a curated dataset of a cohort of 4 lakes (Tsho Rolpa, Chamlang Tsho, Tilicho and Gokyo Lake). The model achieves an IoU of 0.9130 validating the success and efficacy of the "temporal-first" strategy required for transitioning to Early Warning Systems. Beyond the model, we propose an operational engineering architecture: a Dockerised pipeline that automates data ingestion via the ASF Search API and exposes inference results via a RESTful endpoint. This system shifts the paradigm from static mapping to dynamic and automated early warning, providing a scalable architectural foundation for future development in Early Warning Systems.

Abstract: Digital humanities are significantly transforming how Egyptologists study ancient Egyptian texts. The OCR-PT-CT project proposes a recognition method for hieroglyphs based on images of Coffin Texts (CT) from Adriaan de Buck (1935-1961) and Pyramid Texts (PT) from Middle Kingdom coffins (James Allen, 2006). The system identifies hieroglyphs and transcribes them into Gardiner's codes. A web tool organizes them by spells and witnesses, storing the data in CSV format for integration with the MORTEXVAR dataset, which collects Coffin Texts with metadata, transliterations, and translations for research. Recognition has been addressed in two ways: a Mobilenet neural network trained on 140 hieroglyph classes achieved 93.87 \% accuracy but struggled with underrepresented classes. A novel Deep Metric Learning approach improves flexibility for new or data-limited signs, achieving 97.70 \% accuracy and recognizing more hieroglyphs. Due to its superior performance under class imbalance and adaptability, the final system adopts Deep Metric Learning as the default classifier.

Abstract: Whether a video can be compressed at an extreme compression rate as low as 0.01%? To this end, we achieve the compression rate as 0.02% at some cases by introducing Generative Video Compression (GVC), a new framework that redefines the limits of video compression by leveraging modern generative video models to achieve extreme compression rates while preserving a perception-centric, task-oriented communication paradigm, corresponding to Level C of the Shannon-Weaver model. Besides, How we trade computation for compression rate or bandwidth? GVC answers this question by shifting the burden from transmission to inference: it encodes video into extremely compact representations and delegates content reconstruction to the receiver, where powerful generative priors synthesize high-quality video from minimal transmitted information. Is GVC practical and deployable? To ensure practical deployment, we propose a compression-computation trade-off strategy, enabling fast inference on consume-grade GPUs. Within the AI Flow framework, GVC opens new possibility for video communication in bandwidth- and resource-constrained environments such as emergency rescue, remote surveillance, and mobile edge computing. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that GVC offers a viable path toward a new effective, efficient, scalable, and practical video communication paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先天性心脏病是最常见的先天性异常，也是新生儿发病和死亡的主要原因。孕早期胎儿超声心动图虽能早期检测，但自动化分析面临心脏结构小、信噪比低、操作者间差异大等挑战，需要更鲁棒的分类方法。

Conclusion: 自监督超声基础模型USF-MAE在孕早期胎儿心脏视图分类任务中表现优异，优于传统监督学习方法，为早期先天性心脏病自动化检测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Congenital heart disease remains the most common congenital anomaly and a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Although first-trimester fetal echocardiography offers an opportunity for earlier detection, automated analysis at this stage is challenging due to small cardiac structures, low signal-to-noise ratio, and substantial inter-operator variability. In this work, we evaluate a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model, USF-MAE, for first-trimester fetal heart view classification. USF-MAE is pretrained using masked autoencoding modelling on more than 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images spanning over 40 anatomical regions and is subsequently fine-tuned for downstream classification. As a proof of concept, the pretrained Vision Transformer encoder was fine-tuned on an open-source dataset of 6,720 first-trimester fetal echocardiography images to classify five categories: aorta, atrioventricular flows, V sign, X sign, and Other. Model performance was benchmarked against supervised convolutional neural network baselines (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) model pretrained on natural images (ImageNet-1k). All models were trained and evaluated using identical preprocessing, data splits, and optimization protocols. On an independent test set, USF-MAE achieved the highest performance across all evaluation metrics, with 90.57% accuracy, 91.15% precision, 90.57% recall, and 90.71% F1-score. This represents an improvement of +2.03% in accuracy and +1.98% in F1-score compared with the strongest baseline, ResNet-18. The proposed approach demonstrated robust performance without reliance on aggressive image preprocessing or region-of-interest cropping and showed improved discrimination of non-diagnostic frames.

Abstract: We present a new approach for representing and reconstructing multidimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Our method builds on a novel, learned feature-based image representation that disentangles different types of features, such as geometry and contrast, into distinct low-dimensional latent spaces, enabling better exploitation of feature correlations in multidimensional images and incorporation of pre-learned priors specific to different feature types for reconstruction. More specifically, the disentanglement was achieved via an encoderdecoder network and image transfer training using large public data, enhanced by a style-based decoder design. A latent diffusion model was introduced to impose stronger constraints on distinct feature spaces. New reconstruction formulations and algorithms were developed to integrate the learned representation with a zero-shot selfsupervised learning adaptation and subspace modeling. The proposed method has been evaluated on accelerated T1 and T2 parameter mapping, achieving improved performance over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, without task-specific supervised training or fine-tuning. This work offers a new strategy for learning-based multidimensional image reconstruction where only limited data are available for problem-specific or task-specific training.
