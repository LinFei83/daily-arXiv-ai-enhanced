Traditional control techniques often rely on\nprecise system models and are sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external\nperturbations. To overcome these limitations, we first develop a SAC-based\nexpert controller that demonstrates improved resilience against actuator\nfailures, sensor noise, and attitude misalignments, outperforming our previous\nresults in several challenging scenarios. We then use GAIL to train a learner\npolicy that imitates the expert's trajectories, thereby reducing training costs\nand improving generalization through expert demonstrations. Preliminary\nexperiments under single and combined perturbations show that the SAC expert\ncan rotate the antenna to a specified direction and keep the antenna\norientation reliably stable in most of the listed perturbations. Additionally,\nthe GAIL learner can imitate most of the features from the trajectories\ngenerated by the SAC expert. Comparative evaluations and ablation studies\nconfirm the effectiveness of the SAC algorithm and reward shaping.

While recent\nadvances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models\nare computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that\ncombines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs.\nLike biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast\ncues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel\nDifference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently,\nPDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues\nare extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference\nconvolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard\nconvolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.\nAdditionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for\nvideo SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast\ncapture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve\nsignificant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin\ndevice, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on\nstreamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in\nour experiments by more than $2\\times$ and $3\\times$ in speed with superior\naccuracy.

Residual vibrations in these systems not only degrade\noperational efficiency but also pose risks to structural integrity and\nlongevity. Traditional input shaping techniques, while effective, often suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to parameter inaccuracies and environmental\ndisturbances. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative\nunscented Kalman filter-based zero vibration derivative input shaping (UZS)\nmethod.

However, the segmented vascular structure is often\ndiscontinuous due to its slender nature and inadequate prior modeling. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Serpentine Window Mamba (SWinMamba) to achieve\naccurate vascular segmentation. The proposed SWinMamba innovatively models the\ncontinuity of slender vascular structures by incorporating serpentine window\nsequences into bidirectional state space models. The serpentine window\nsequences enable efficient feature capturing by adaptively guiding global\nvisual context modeling to the vascular structure. Specifically, the Serpentine\nWindow Tokenizer (SWToken) adaptively splits the input image using overlapping\nserpentine window sequences, enabling flexible receptive fields (RFs) for\nvascular structure modeling.

However, directly training policies to\nsimultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due\nto unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address\nthis, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving\npriors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple\nstages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors\nthrough iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER\nprogressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration\nand policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or\nhandcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured\nthree-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation\nspace, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust\nmonopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the\nresulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional\nmethods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly\nspaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm.\nJumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing\nlocomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains.", "AI": {"tldr": "JumpER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u5355\u8db3\u8df3\u8dc3\u4efb\u52a1\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "JumpER\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u6f14\u5316\uff09\u3002", "result": "JumpER\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u5355\u8db3\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u5bf960\u5398\u7c73\u5bbd\u95f4\u9699\u3001\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u697c\u68af\u548c15-35\u5398\u7c73\u95f4\u8ddd\u7684\u8e0f\u77f3\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "JumpER\u4e3a\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,\nStable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing\nmethods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,\nan Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure\nvalues, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is\ntime-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce\nthis overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to\nabout 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by\ntraining a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the\niterative process.

Most of the current designs of motion\nprediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines,\nwhich limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic\nrules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting\nmodel informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and\nroad edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of\ndriving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to\nmerge information in different vector map components, where the model learns\nholistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents.\nSince encoding more information about the road environment increases memory\nusage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning\nmechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent,\nensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and\nsemantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the\nlimitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more\ninformative and efficient representation of the driving environment and\nadvances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We\nverify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion\nforecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while\nachieving improved performance.\n  Index Terms-Autonomous driving, trajectory prediction, vector map elements,\nroad topology, connection pruning, Argoverse 2.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u5730\u56fe\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u8f66\u9053\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u9053\u8def\u8fb9\u7f18\u7b49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f66\u9053\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u9053\u8def\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u5411\u91cf\u5730\u56fe\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\u7b5b\u9009\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u5728Argoverse 2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9053\u8def\u73af\u5883\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This article is a significantly extended version of a paper\n  presented by the authors at IJCAI-2022", "summary": "Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem\nsolving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples.

Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is\nessential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB\nsystems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than\naccurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved\nAWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera\nsensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has\nexplored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral\nwhite balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic\nconsistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms\nneutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a\ncamera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any\nneutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across\nunseen cameras.

We\nhypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in\npreference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or\nlack rigorous quality control.

Although\nAI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application\nto prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on\nimage-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing\nless emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level\nmultiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane\nlocalization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.\nOur contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts\nmodule (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes.

LCS programs herald a\ngenerational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related\nearly-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of\nradiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a\ncomputationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT\nanalysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can\nbe fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with\nlimited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained\nfrom scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning,\nthereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label\nefficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of\nfine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000\nthoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public\ndatasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease\nclassification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases,\nwhile generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a\nmasked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable\nsolution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive\nmodels by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest\ncomputational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays\nthe foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools\nthat could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular\nfocus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management\nin high-risk populations.", "AI": {"tldr": "TANGERINE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u4f4e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\uff08LDCT\uff09\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u77ed\u7f3a\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89e3\u8bfbLDCT\u626b\u63cf\u6210\u4e3a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "TANGERINE\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u8fc798,000\u4e2a\u80f8\u90e8LDCT\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc73D\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u572814\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u80ba\u764c\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u547c\u5438\u7cfb\u7edf\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "TANGERINE\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5c06\u80ba\u764c\u7b5b\u67e5\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u547c\u5438\u7cfb\u7edf\u75be\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant\ncolor background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a\ndiffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called\nDocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space,\nenabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the\nissue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM).\nIt is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions\nspecially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion\nmodule (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by\nsupervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a\nshadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in\ndocument images.

While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity\nverification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient\nrobustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated\nremarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of\nwatermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel\nrobust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By\nmodifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and\nwatermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise\nand generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial\ncondition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that\ngradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus\nbetter adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the\nfusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)\nmodule that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract\nwatermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.\nTo enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we\nintegrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake\nmanipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that\nemploys specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling\nprocess to generate more robust watermarked images.

Many\nendeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and\ngenerate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate\nthe drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and\napplications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to\nretrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods\noften fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this\nchallenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and\nfind the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the\nobservation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next\ntoken, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec\ngenerates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate\nthe next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token\nand the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which\ncan be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks.

Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising\napproach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial\neffectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies\non mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by\nsimulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the\nreal world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training\nimages, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial\ncamouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,\nprior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse\nviewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework\nbased on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and\nprecise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering\ncapabilities.

To handle\nthis, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic\nThreshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and\nimproves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also\nleverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and\nDINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise\nbounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's\nzero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The\nquality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance\nto our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an\nobject matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the\naverage maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,\ncalculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance\nbetween each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image\ngrid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and\nmask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.\nWe empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,\noutperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the\nBOP 2023 challenge for the \"Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects\"\ntask.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOCTIS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Grounded-SAM 2\u548cDINOv2\uff0c\u5728BOP 2023\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Grounded-SAM 2\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d0\u8bae\u548c\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0cDINOv2\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u9608\u503c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4f18\u5316\u5339\u914d\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728BOP 2023\u6311\u6218\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RGB\u548cRGB-D\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NOCTIS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Toward\nthis end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the\nfirst to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.\nFinally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthis benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5Activation RMs\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bfc\u5411\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bfc\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u51faActivation RMs\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1PreferenceHack\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "Activation RMs\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u548cPreferenceHack\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7GPT-4o\u3002", "conclusion": "Activation RMs\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In this study, we conduct a systematic\nevaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect\nstance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.\nSurprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,\nwith macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\\%.

However, existing\nmethods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA),\nparticularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous\napproaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity\ninformation embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information\ncan be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper\nintroduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both\nissues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an\nEnhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information\nfrom motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads.\nTo address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes\nthe leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the\nartifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixTalk effectively mitigates\nIL and RA, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FixTalk\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7EMI\u548cEDI\u89e3\u51b3\u8eab\u4efd\u6cc4\u6f0f\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u6cc4\u6f0f\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEMI\u89e3\u8026\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cEDI\u5229\u7528\u6cc4\u6f0f\u4fe1\u606f\u8865\u5145\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFixTalk\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8eab\u4efd\u6cc4\u6f0f\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FixTalk\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor\nattacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured\nin the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the\nfirst system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition\nsystems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of\nDNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the\nfirst time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and\nface landmark shift attacks.

However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative\nvision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated\ncaptions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the\nproperties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot\nsmoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given\nthis challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single\ncaptioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach\nquantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and\nuniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.\nGiven the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two\nendpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very\nshort caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output\ncaptions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines.

This suboptimal approach, combined with the unnatural placement\nof the excessively long screws, lead to complications such as screw\nmisplacement, extended surgery times, and increased radiation exposure due to\nrepeated X-ray images taken ensure to safety of procedure. To address these\nchallenges, in this paper, we present the design and development of a unique 4\ndegree-of-freedom (DoF) pelvic concentric tube steerable drilling robot (pelvic\nCT-SDR).

Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive\nevaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples,\nthereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness.\nExtensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the\nvarying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained\nanalyses of model-specific weaknesses.

Existing methods using maximal clique search in\ncompatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time\ncomplexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel\nlightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided\nSearch (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a\nhighly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique\nallows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained\ncompatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable\ntransformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$\nscores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with\nhigher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity\nand is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with\nexponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with\nsubstantial speed improvements.

Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly\nscores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment\nanomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant\nchallenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations\namong pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)\nvariabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing\nglobal thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or\nmiss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel\nmulti-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these\nlimitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO\ncombines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level\nsegmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we\npropose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that\nsequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual\nrepresentations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection\nmodel's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we\ndevelop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically\ngenerates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs\nand pixel-wise anomaly scores.

Meanwhile,\nmany existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing\npotential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,\nonboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane\nenhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited\nonboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on\nefficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,\nCEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a\nMag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art\nalgorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection\npotential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).\nOur results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both\nacceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally\nefficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the\nother more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than\noriginal Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and\nevaluate three band selection strategies.

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required.

We address these\nchallenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable\nand API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized\nbenchmarking framework.\n  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art\nspecialist models at any task.

Specifically,\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and\n3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and\nGSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform\na quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more\nclosely aligned with base SLM distributions. Our insights pave the way for\nfuture research into long-CoT data distillation for SLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiCoTA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u957f\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u56e0\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MiCoTA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7b49\u957f\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "result": "SLMs\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5982Qwen2.5-7B\u548c3B\u6a21\u578b\u5728AIME2024\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u63d0\u9ad83.47\u548c3.93\u3002", "conclusion": "MiCoTA\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e3aSLMs\u7684\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u94fa\u8def\u3002"}}

Consequently,\nsegmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of\nlarge-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise\nlocalization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).\nHowever, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,\nwhich excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its\ninherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic\nsegmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models\nexcel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms\nthat the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability\nto learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models\nexhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided\nsolely by the original image.

This map and the original image are fed\ninto a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation\nsubsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the\ncoarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic\nsegmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our\nframework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results\nfrom diverse discriminative architectures.

We first analyze different vision\nnetwork architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature\nattribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning\npromotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving\nunsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while\npreserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the\nalignment between model representations and human perception, investigating\nwhether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to\nhumans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse\nmodels exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human\nalignment.

To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{HCNQA}, a 3D VQA\nmodel leveraging a hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision method. By\nmimicking the human process of gradually focusing from a broad area to specific\nobjects while searching for answers, our method guides the model to perform\nthree phases of concentration narrowing through hierarchical supervision. By\nsupervising key checkpoints on a general reasoning pathway, our method can\nensure the development of a rational and effective reasoning pathway. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure that\nthe model develops a rational reasoning pathway and performs better.

However, in real-world scenarios where\nannotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with\nscarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)\nproblem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing\nLReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from\nlimited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy\nknowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we\npioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing\nPrototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key\ninnovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic\nprototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative\npurification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,\nlearnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the\nidentity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the\ndual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and\nhistorical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this\ncyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve\ncurrent-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term\nlearning.

To address this, patient-specific digital twins\n(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of\nDIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D\nsequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published\nanalytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,\nincluding six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,\nand three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were\nassessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from\nindependent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six\ndifferent DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity\ncoefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics\nand voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans\nfrom patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were\nwarped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of\nDIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error\nestimation.

However,\ncurrent approaches conventionally separate image customization into\nposition-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal\nframework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various\nscenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image\ncustomization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference\nimages with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal\nattention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the\nIn-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented\nregister tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to\ncorrectly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in\npolyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a\nhigh-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world\nsources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and\nover-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial\napplications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and\ncreative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench\nand the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly\noutperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art\nopen-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human\npreference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment\nmetrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters.

Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,\nautomated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has\nsignificant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term\ncolorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features\nto achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local\nparadigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color\nconsistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can\nbe achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically\nextracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.\nSpecifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly\nincludes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color\nConsistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support\nthe DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to\ndynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with\nthe current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce\na Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency\nfusion to smooth the video segment transition.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an\n8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge\nperformance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust\ngeneral-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on\ntwo core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens\nwith a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe\nfeatures a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,\nfollowed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first\npost-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction\nfollowing, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In\nthis second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data\nmixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think\nwith image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to\ndecide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and\nalignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct\nabnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,\nwe conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly\ncompetitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1).

Unlike existing\nmethods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by\ntime constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers\nhigh-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite\ntheir efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in\nmaintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step\ndenoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In\nthis paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating\ntwo key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical\ninterpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images\nby modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and\nensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We\nfurther introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention\nmodules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent\ntransitions that respect both inputs.
