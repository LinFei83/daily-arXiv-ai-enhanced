### [1] [Think Clearly: Improving Reasoning via Redundant Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08806)
*Daewon Choi,Jimin Lee,Jihoon Tack,Woomin Song,Saket Dingliwal,Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi,Bhavana Ganesh,Jinwoo Shin,Aram Galstyan,Sravan Babu Bodapati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过去除推理过程中的冗余注意力来提高大语言模型性能的方法，显著提升了数学竞赛等推理密集型任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到当前大语言模型在长链推理中存在注意力分散和冗余问题，尤其是在错误答案中表现更明显。

Method: 通过测量特殊结束标记的注意力分数识别冗余，提出结构感知剪枝方法去除低贡献推理块，随后恢复推理生成。

Result: 方法在无需训练的情况下显著提升了推理密集型任务的准确性，尤其在数学竞赛基准测试中表现突出。

Conclusion: 去除推理冗余能有效提升模型性能，尤其在复杂推理任务中效果显著。

Abstract: Recent large language models have shown promising capabilities in long-form
reasoning, following structured chains of thought before arriving at a final
answer. However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include
substantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention
scores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater
attention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing
this redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance
through clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we
systematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention
scores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit
instruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,
we propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in
low-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting
redundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then
resume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly
improves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any
training involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on
challenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where
reasoning redundancy is more prevalent.

### [2] [A New Approach for Multicriteria Assessment in the Ranking of Alternatives Using Cardinal and Ordinal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08875)
*Fuh-Hwa Franklin Liu,Su-Chuan Shih*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合两种虚拟差距分析（VGA）模型的新型多准则评估（MCA）方法，以提高评估的效率和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多准则评估方法（如DEA、SFA、MCDM）中依赖假设和主观判断的问题，并整合定量与定性标准。

Method: 结合两种VGA模型，基于线性编程框架，提出新的MCA方法。

Result: 通过两个数值示例验证了方法的准确性和透明度。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化决策系统提供了全面可靠的解决方案，推动了决策支持系统的进步。

Abstract: Modern methods for multi-criteria assessment (MCA), such as Data Envelopment
Analysis (DEA), Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), and Multiple Criteria
Decision-Making (MCDM), are utilized to appraise a collection of
Decision-Making Units (DMUs), also known as alternatives, based on several
criteria. These methodologies inherently rely on assumptions and can be
influenced by subjective judgment to effectively tackle the complex evaluation
challenges in various fields. In real-world scenarios, it is essential to
incorporate both quantitative and qualitative criteria as they consist of
cardinal and ordinal data. Despite the inherent variability in the criterion
values of different alternatives, the homogeneity assumption is often employed,
significantly affecting evaluations. To tackle these challenges and determine
the most appropriate alternative, we propose a novel MCA approach that combines
two Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models. The VGA framework, rooted in linear
programming, is pivotal in the MCA methodology. This approach improves
efficiency and fairness, ensuring that evaluations are both comprehensive and
dependable, thus offering a strong and adaptive solution. Two comprehensive
numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and transparency of our proposed
method. The goal is to encourage continued advancement and stimulate progress
in automated decision systems and decision support systems.

### [3] [Multi-Actor Generative Artificial Intelligence as a Game Engine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08892)
*Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets,Jayd Matyas,Logan Cross,Davide Paglieri,Minsuk Chang,William A. Cunningham,Simon Osindero,William S. Isaac,Joel Z. Leibo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于桌游角色扮演游戏（TTRPGs）的灵活场景定义框架，用于支持生成式AI在多角色环境中的多样化应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足生成式AI在模拟、叙事和评估等多样化应用中的需求，需要一个灵活的框架来定义场景。

Method: 采用实体-组件架构模式，将游戏管理员（GM）设计为可配置的实体，由组件构成，实现工程师与设计师的分工协作。

Result: 通过Concordia库的实践，展示了该框架如何支持用户快速配置符合特定目标的场景。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分离关注点，实现了快速迭代、模块化和可扩展性，适用于多样化的生成式AI应用。

Abstract: Generative AI can be used in multi-actor environments with purposes ranging
from social science modeling to interactive narrative and AI evaluation.
Supporting this diversity of use cases -- which we classify as Simulationist,
Dramatist, and Evaluationist -- demands a flexible scenario definition
framework. We argue here that a good approach is to take inspiration from
tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), where a Game Master (GM) is responsible
for the environment and generates all parts of the story not directly
determined by the voluntary actions of player characters. We argue that the
Entity-Component architectural pattern is useful here. In such a system, the GM
is not a hardcoded computer game but is itself a configurable entity, composed
of components just like any other actor. By design, the approach allows for a
separation between the underlying implementation details handled by an
engineer, the creation of reusable components, and their composition and
configuration managed by a designer who constructs entities from the
components. This separation of concerns is instrumental for achieving rapid
iteration, maintaining modularity, and ultimately to ensure scalability. We
describe the ongoing evolution of the Concordia library in terms of this
philosophy, demonstrating how it allows users to effectively configure
scenarios that align with their specific goals.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BioAnalyst是一个基于Transformer架构的基础模型，专为生物多样性分析和保护规划设计，通过多模态数据预训练，适用于多种下游任务，如物种分布建模和栖息地评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物多样性快速丧失对生态研究和保护策略提出严峻挑战，需要新的监测和预测工具。AI基础模型在科学领域的成功应用为生物多样性保护提供了新思路。

Method: BioAnalyst采用Transformer架构，预训练于多模态数据集（物种记录、遥感数据、气候变量等），可微调用于多种下游任务。

Result: 在数据稀缺场景下，BioAnalyst在两种用例中表现出优于现有方法的泛化能力，为生态预测设立了新的准确性基准。

Conclusion: BioAnalyst的开放发布旨在促进生物多样性建模的合作，推动AI解决生态挑战。

Abstract: The accelerating loss of biodiversity presents critical challenges for
ecological research and conservation strategies. The preservation of
biodiversity is paramount for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the
sustainability of ecosystems. However, biodiversity faces numerous threats,
including habitat loss, climate change, and the proliferation of invasive
species. Addressing these and other ecology-related challenges, both at local
and global scales, requires comprehensive monitoring, predictive and
conservation planning capabilities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation
Models (FMs) have gained significant momentum in numerous scientific domains by
leveraging vast datasets to learn general-purpose representations adaptable to
various downstream tasks. This paradigm holds immense promise for biodiversity
conservation. In response, we introduce BioAnalyst, the first Foundation Model
tailored for biodiversity analysis and conservation planning. BioAnalyst
employs a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on extensive multi-modal
datasets encompassing species occurrence records, remote sensing indicators,
climate and environmental variables. BioAnalyst is designed for adaptability,
allowing for fine-tuning of a range of downstream tasks, such as species
distribution modelling, habitat suitability assessments, invasive species
detection, and population trend forecasting. We evaluate the model's
performance on two downstream use cases, demonstrating its generalisability
compared to existing methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios for two
distinct use-cases, establishing a new accuracy baseline for ecological
forecasting. By openly releasing BioAnalyst and its fine-tuning workflows to
the scientific community, we aim to foster collaborative efforts in
biodiversity modelling and advance AI-driven solutions to pressing ecological
challenges.

### [5] [Measuring the Impact of Early-2025 AI on Experienced Open-Source Developer Productivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09089)
*Joel Becker,Nate Rush,Elizabeth Barnes,David Rein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管开发者预期AI工具能缩短任务完成时间，但实际使用AI工具反而增加了19%的完成时间，与经济学和ML专家的预测相反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI工具在现实软件开发中对开发者生产力的实际影响。

Method: 通过随机对照试验（RCT），16名有中等AI经验的开发者在成熟项目中完成246项任务，随机允许或禁止使用2025年的AI工具（如Cursor Pro和Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet）。

Result: 使用AI工具导致任务完成时间增加19%，与开发者预期的20%缩短和专家预测的38-39%缩短相反。

Conclusion: AI工具在实际开发中可能并未如预期提升生产力，甚至可能减缓开发速度，这一现象需要进一步研究以排除实验设计的影响。

Abstract: Despite widespread adoption, the impact of AI tools on software development
in the wild remains understudied. We conduct a randomized controlled trial
(RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the
productivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate
AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an
average of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow
or disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers
primarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet.
Before starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce
completion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that
allowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing
AI actually increases completion time by 19%--AI tooling slowed developers
down. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39%
shorter) and ML (38% shorter). To understand this result, we collect and
evaluate evidence for 20 properties of our setting that a priori could
contribute to the observed slowdown effect--for example, the size and quality
standards of projects, or prior developer experience with AI tooling. Although
the influence of experimental artifacts cannot be entirely ruled out, the
robustness of the slowdown effect across our analyses suggests it is unlikely
to primarily be a function of our experimental design.

*Ronghua Shi,Yiou Liu,Xinyu Ying,Yang Tan,Yuchun Feng,Lynn Ai,Bill Shi,Xuhui Wang,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体强化学习（MARL）的框架，用于检测去中心化金融（DeFi）中的市场操纵行为，通过动态对抗游戏建模操纵者与检测器的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeFi的无许可创新带来了市场操纵问题，缺乏中心化监管导致恶意行为频发。

Method: 采用MARL框架，结合GRPO优化、理论驱动的奖励函数和多模态智能体管道，整合语义特征、社交图信号和链上数据。

Result: 在真实数据和对抗模拟中验证，Hide-and-Shill系统在检测准确性和因果归因方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为去中心化市场情报提供了新范式，推动了多智能体系统与金融监管的结合。

Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new era of permissionless
financial innovation but also led to unprecedented market manipulation. Without
centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and
pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation
detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a
dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using
delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces
three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance
learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a
theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information
asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a
multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social
graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The
framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent
architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning
through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony
promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust
manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time
surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world
discourse episodes and validated in adversarial simulations, Hide-and-Shill
achieves top performance in detection accuracy and causal attribution. This
work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, advancing a new
paradigm for decentralized market intelligence. All resources are available at
the Hide-and-Shill GitHub repository to promote open research and
reproducibility.

*Matous Kozak,Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam,Siva Sivaraman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文首次系统评估了基于LLM的编程代理的安全性，发现21%的操作存在安全隐患，并提出了检测系统和缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解基于LLM的编程代理在软件开发中的安全影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 分析了12,000多个操作，涉及5种先进模型（如GPT-4o、GPT-4.1等）在93个实际软件任务中的表现。

Result: 21%的操作存在安全隐患，信息泄露（CWE-200）最常见；GPT-4.1的缓解成功率高达96.8%。

Conclusion: 研究为评估编程代理安全性提供了框架，并强调下一代LLM编程代理需注重安全设计。

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents are rapidly being deployed in software development,
yet their security implications remain poorly understood. These agents, while
capable of accelerating software development, may inadvertently introduce
insecure practices. We conducted the first systematic security evaluation of
autonomous coding agents, analyzing over 12,000 actions across five
state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude variants) on 93 real-world
software setup tasks. Our findings reveal significant security concerns: 21% of
agent trajectories contained insecure actions, with models showing substantial
variation in security behavior. We developed a high-precision detection system
that identified four major vulnerability categories, with information exposure
(CWE-200) being the most prevalent one. We also evaluated mitigation strategies
including feedback mechanisms and security reminders with various effectiveness
between models. GPT-4.1 demonstrated exceptional security awareness with 96.8%
mitigation success. Our work provides the first comprehensive framework for
evaluating coding agent security and highlights the need for security-aware
design of next generation LLM-based coding agents.

Abstract: This report presents a taxonomy and examples of potential omnicidal events
resulting from AI: scenarios where all or almost all humans are killed. These
events are not presented as inevitable, but as possibilities that we can work
to avoid. Insofar as large institutions require a degree of public support in
order to take certain actions, we hope that by presenting these possibilities
in public, we can help to support preventive measures against catastrophic
risks from AI.

*Chenglin Zhu,Tao Zhang,Chong Li,Mingan Lin,Zenan Zhou,Jian Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EduFlow是一个端到端框架，旨在提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在科学任务中的推理能力，通过EduPRM和EduMCTS实现多步推理和自校正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在科学任务中表现不佳，缺乏多步推理和自校正能力，EduFlow旨在解决这些问题。

Method: EduFlow结合EduPRM（过程感知奖励模型）和EduMCTS（领域适应搜索框架），通过课程学习和自反射机制优化推理。

Result: 实验表明EduFlow显著提升了推理的一致性和连贯性。

Conclusion: EduFlow为科学教育任务提供了一种有效的端到端解决方案，未来将公开代码、数据和模型。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still perform poorly on scientific
tasks, particularly those requiring multi-step and interpretable reasoning.
Their limitations include insufficient scientific reasoning patterns, lack of
global coherence in multi-step inference, and the absence of reflective
self-correction, making them unreliable in structured scientific contexts. We
introduce EduFlow, the first end-to-end framework that covers the full pipeline
of educational scientific reasoning, including data selection, MCTS-based
trajectory construction, model training, and output optimization. At its core
is EduPRM, a process-aware reward model that critiques reasoning steps with
tags and justifications. EduPRM is trained via curriculum learning on three
complementary supervision sources: MCTS-guided trajectories, error-injected
critiques, and teacher-student dialogues, enabling dynamic adaptation to
multi-stage problem solving and iterative refinement during inference. We
further propose EduMCTS, a domain-adapted search framework that introduces
bootstrapping actions specifically designed for educational reasoning, such as
a self-reflection mechanism that promotes reflective error correction. It
further leverages EduPRM's fine-grained feedback to guide the search toward
higher-quality reasoning trajectories. By applying self-consistency and
rejection sampling, we constructed EduMCTS-160K, a large-scale dataset of
educational reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
EduFlow enhances reasoning consistency and coherence. Code, data, and models
will be released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何结合可解释性和适应性，设计可迁移且可解释的神经符号AI系统。

Method: 系统评估了知识表示的结构和复杂性对LLM查询三元组存储的影响。

Result: 结果表明，不同知识表示方法对查询效果有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究为设计更高效的Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Explainability and interpretability are cornerstones of frontier and
next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This is especially true
in recent systems, such as large language models (LLMs), and more broadly,
generative AI. On the other hand, adaptability to new domains, contexts, or
scenarios is also an important aspect for a successful system. As such, we are
particularly interested in how we can merge these two efforts, that is,
investigating the design of transferable and interpretable neurosymbolic AI
systems. Specifically, we focus on a class of systems referred to as ''Agentic
Retrieval-Augmented Generation'' systems, which actively select, interpret, and
query knowledge sources in response to natural language prompts. In this paper,
we systematically evaluate how different conceptualizations and representations
of knowledge, particularly the structure and complexity, impact an AI agent (in
this case, an LLM) in effectively querying a triplestore. We report our
results, which show that there are impacts from both approaches, and we discuss
their impact and implications.

TL;DR: LLM-Stackelberg游戏框架将大型语言模型（LLM）融入领导者与追随者的战略互动中，通过结构化提示和概率行为生成，定义了两类均衡概念，展示了在网络安全等领域的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Stackelberg游戏假设完全信息和理性行为，而现实中的决策者往往受限于信息不对称和有限理性，因此需要一种新框架来模拟更真实的战略互动。

Method: 提出LLM-Stackelberg游戏框架，利用LLM生成行为并通过结构化提示进行推理，定义推理与行为均衡及推测推理均衡。

Result: 通过钓鱼攻击案例展示了框架的认知丰富性和对抗潜力，验证了其在网络安全等领域的适用性。

Conclusion: LLM-Stackelberg游戏为建模有限理性、信息不对称和认知适应的决策问题提供了新范式。

Abstract: We introduce the framework of LLM-Stackelberg games, a class of sequential
decision-making models that integrate large language models (LLMs) into
strategic interactions between a leader and a follower. Departing from
classical Stackelberg assumptions of complete information and rational agents,
our formulation allows each agent to reason through structured prompts,
generate probabilistic behaviors via LLMs, and adapt their strategies through
internal cognition and belief updates. We define two equilibrium concepts:
reasoning and behavioral equilibrium, which aligns an agent's internal
prompt-based reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning
equilibrium, which accounts for epistemic uncertainty through parameterized
models over an opponent's response. These layered constructs capture bounded
rationality, asymmetric information, and meta-cognitive adaptation. We
illustrate the framework through a spearphishing case study, where a sender and
a recipient engage in a deception game using structured reasoning prompts. This
example highlights the cognitive richness and adversarial potential of
LLM-mediated interactions. Our results show that LLM-Stackelberg games provide
a powerful paradigm for modeling decision-making in domains such as
cybersecurity, misinformation, and recommendation systems.

*Hang Wang,Junshan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出从反应式到主动式多智能体强化学习的范式转变，利用生成式AI实现前瞻性决策和协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在多智能体强化学习中面临指数级增长的动作空间、非静态环境和部分可观测性等挑战，无法应对新场景。

Method: 通过生成式AI重构智能体为生成模型，预测环境演变和其他智能体行为，生成协调动作序列，实现战略推理。

Result: 该方法利用生成式AI的识别与生成能力，实现主动决策、无缝协调和动态适应。

Conclusion: 这一范式转变有望解决传统框架难以处理的协作问题，推动分布式智能和集体行为的发展。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning faces fundamental challenges that
conventional approaches have failed to overcome: exponentially growing joint
action spaces, non-stationary environments where simultaneous learning creates
moving targets, and partial observability that constrains coordination. Current
methods remain reactive, employing stimulus-response mechanisms that fail when
facing novel scenarios. We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from
reactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based
reinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as
isolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of
synthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions
based on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than
responding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model
environment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated
action sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term
dynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation
capabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless
coordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving
scenarios. We envision this paradigm shift will unlock unprecedented
possibilities for distributed intelligence, moving beyond individual
optimization toward emergent collective behaviors representing genuine
collaborative intelligence. The implications extend across autonomous systems,
robotics, and human-AI collaboration, promising solutions to coordination
challenges intractable under traditional reactive frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在规划中计算成本高，CTP旨在通过单步轨迹生成解决这一问题。

Method: 利用一致性轨迹模型（CTM）进行高效轨迹优化，支持快速单步生成。

Result: 在D4RL测试中表现优异，性能接近且推理速度快120倍。

Conclusion: CTP高效实用，适用于高性能、低延迟的离线规划。

Abstract: This paper introduces Consistency Trajectory Planning (CTP), a novel offline
model-based reinforcement learning method that leverages the recently proposed
Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM) for efficient trajectory optimization. While
prior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong
performance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative
sampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation
without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL
benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based
planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves
higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In
particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup
in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for
high-performance, low-latency offline planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Metropolis-Hastings采样的框架，用于训练SNN在RL任务中，无需依赖梯度方法，表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN在实时控制系统中具有生物启发和高效能优势，但其训练因脉冲通信的不可微分性而面临挑战。

Method: 采用Metropolis-Hastings采样，通过迭代提议和概率接受参数更新，绕过反向传播限制。

Result: 在AcroBot和CartPole基准测试中，该方法在累积奖励和资源效率上优于传统DQL和SNN方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为SNN在RL任务中的训练提供了高效且资源优化的解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer biologically inspired, energy-efficient
alternatives to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for real-time control
systems. However, their training presents several challenges, particularly for
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, due to the non-differentiable nature of
spike-based communication. In this work, we introduce what is, to our
knowledge, the first framework that employs Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling,
a Bayesian inference technique, to train SNNs for dynamical agent control in RL
environments without relying on gradient-based methods. Our approach
iteratively proposes and probabilistically accepts network parameter updates
based on accumulated reward signals, effectively circumventing the limitations
of backpropagation while enabling direct optimization on neuromorphic
platforms. We evaluated this framework on two standard control benchmarks:
AcroBot and CartPole. The results demonstrate that our MH-based approach
outperforms conventional Deep Q-Learning (DQL) baselines and prior SNN-based RL
approaches in terms of maximizing the accumulated reward while minimizing
network resources and training episodes.

Motivation: 解决企业在AI应用中面临的数据安全和知识保留问题，同时提升团队效率。

Method: 平台集成结构化文档处理、混合向量检索和无代码编排，支持多种LLM，并通过THOR Agent处理SQL查询。

Result: 实验显示，512令牌分块检索精度最高（Top-3准确率91.3%），生成质量提升23%。

Conclusion: eSapiens在高风险领域（如法律和金融）中实现了可信、可审计的AI工作流程。

Abstract: We present eSapiens, an AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) platform engineered around a
business-oriented trifecta: proprietary data, operational workflows, and any
major agnostic Large Language Model (LLM). eSapiens gives businesses full
control over their AI assets, keeping everything in-house for AI knowledge
retention and data security. eSapiens AI Agents (Sapiens) empower your team by
providing valuable insights and automating repetitive tasks, enabling them to
focus on high-impact work and drive better business outcomes.
  The system integrates structured document ingestion, hybrid vector retrieval,
and no-code orchestration via LangChain, and supports top LLMs including
OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. A key component is the THOR Agent, which
handles structured SQL-style queries and generates actionable insights over
enterprise databases.
  To evaluate the system, we conduct two experiments. First, a retrieval
benchmark on legal corpora reveals that a chunk size of 512 tokens yields the
highest retrieval precision (Top-3 accuracy: 91.3%). Second, a generation
quality test using TRACe metrics across five LLMs shows that eSapiens delivers

compute access, and the hidden energy burden of cybersecurity systems. Drawing
from recent studies and institutional reports, the paper highlights systemic
issues such as high emissions from model training, rising hardware turnover,
global infrastructure disparities, and the energy demands of securing AI. By
connecting these concerns, the review contributes to Responsible AI discourse
by identifying key research gaps and advocating for sustainable, transparent,
and equitable development practices. Ultimately, it argues that AI's progress
must align with ethical responsibility and environmental stewardship to ensure
a more inclusive and sustainable technological future.

Motivation: 当前服务机器人系统依赖专有硬编码方案，难以跨平台适配和扩展，而知识图谱和多模态语言模型各有局限。

Method: 结合多模态语言模型的感知能力和知识图谱的结构化表示，生成符合本体论的知识图谱以指导机器人行为。

Result: GPT-o1和LLaMA 4 Maverick表现最优，但新模型不一定更好，集成策略对生成符合本体论的知识图谱至关重要。

Conclusion: 神经符号框架有效支持机器人互操作性，但模型选择和集成策略是关键因素。

Abstract: Personal service robots are deployed to support daily living in domestic
environments, particularly for elderly and individuals requiring assistance.
These robots must perceive complex and dynamic surroundings, understand tasks,
and execute context-appropriate actions. However, current systems rely on
proprietary, hard-coded solutions tied to specific hardware and software,
resulting in siloed implementations that are difficult to adapt and scale
across platforms. Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution to
enable interoperability across systems, through structured and standardized
representations of knowledge and reasoning. However, symbolic systems such as
KGs and ontologies struggle with raw and noisy sensory input. In contrast,
multimodal language models are well suited for interpreting input such as
images and natural language, but often lack transparency, consistency, and
knowledge grounding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that
combines the perceptual strengths of multimodal language models with the
structured representations provided by KGs and ontologies, with the aim of
supporting interoperability in robotic applications. Our approach generates
ontology-compliant KGs that can inform robot behavior in a platform-independent
manner. We evaluated this framework by integrating robot perception data,
ontologies, and five multimodal models (three LLaMA and two GPT models), using
different modes of neural-symbolic interaction. We assess the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated KGs across multiple runs and configurations, and
perform statistical analyzes to evaluate performance. Results show that GPT-o1
and LLaMA 4 Maverick consistently outperform other models. However, our
findings also indicate that newer models do not guarantee better results,
highlighting the critical role of the integration strategy in generating
ontology-compliant KGs.

Method: 开发了一个基于PyTorch的工具包，利用随机控制技术建模AI系统与代理的交互，并以闭环方式评估公平性和鲁棒性。

Result: 工具包简化了多代理系统闭环模型中公平性保证的复杂性，并提供了先验保证。

Conclusion: 该工具包为AI系统在多代理环境中的公平性和鲁棒性提供了有效的建模和保证手段。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems often interact with multiple agents. The
regulation of such AI systems often requires that {\em a priori\/} guarantees
of fairness and robustness be satisfied. With stochastic models of agents'
responses to the outputs of AI systems, such {\em a priori\/} guarantees
require non-trivial reasoning about the corresponding stochastic systems. Here,
we present an open-source PyTorch-based toolkit for the use of stochastic
control techniques in modelling interconnections of AI systems and properties
of their repeated uses. It models robustness and fairness desiderata in a
closed-loop fashion, and provides {\em a priori\/} guarantees for these
interconnections. The PyTorch-based toolkit removes much of the complexity
associated with the provision of fairness guarantees for closed-loop models of
multi-agent systems.

Result: 总结了优化LRMs推理效率的现有方法，并指出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文为研究者提供了该领域的全面概述，旨在启发新的自适应推理方法，以更好地利用LRMs。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 have
demonstrated impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks like mathematics
and programming with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning sequences
(slow-thinking), compared with traditional large language models
(fast-thinking). However, these reasoning models also face a huge challenge
that generating unnecessarily lengthy and redundant reasoning chains even for
trivial questions. This phenomenon leads to a significant waste of inference
resources, increases the response time for simple queries, and hinders the
practical application of LRMs in real-world products. To this end, it is
crucial to shorten lengthy reasoning chains and learn adaptive reasoning
between fast and slow thinking based on input difficulty. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in concise and adaptive
thinking for efficient reasoning of LRMs, including methodologies, benchmarks,
and challenges for future exploration. We hope this survey can help researchers
quickly understand the landscape of this field and inspire novel adaptive
thinking ideas to facilitate better usage of LRMs.

Result: Causal DQ显著减少了异常检测时间，适用于大规模实时数据流。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于传感器布局，还可推广到其他强化学习问题，为工程应用中的因果机器学习提供新思路。

Abstract: Nowadays, as AI-driven manufacturing becomes increasingly popular, the volume
of data streams requiring real-time monitoring continues to grow. However, due
to limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to
detect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal
sensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system
while detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been
proposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider
only variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,
although a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on
interventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which
is impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we
introduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for
partially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating
causal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves
faster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the
trained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for
anomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor
placement in large-scale, real-world data streams. Beyond the current
implementation, our technique's fundamental insights can be applied to various
reinforcement learning problems, opening up new possibilities for real-world
causality-informed machine learning methods in engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在自然语言理解和生成方面表现出色，但其输出存在逻辑不一致问题，需要一种方法在形式推理中利用其广泛知识。

Method: 将LLM直接整合到一种矛盾容忍逻辑的形式语义解释函数中，并通过实验验证其可行性。

Result: 实验证明该方法可行，且不同于以往工作，它提供了一个理论框架，既能利用LLM知识，又能保持逻辑的可靠性和完备性。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经符号推理提供了一个理论框架，解决了LLM的逻辑不一致问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation, but they exhibit problems with
logical consistency in the output they generate. How can we harness LLMs'
broad-coverage parametric knowledge in formal reasoning despite their
inconsistency? We present a method for directly integrating an LLM into the
interpretation function of the formal semantics for a paraconsistent logic. We
provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of the method by evaluating
the function using datasets created from several short-form factuality
benchmarks. Unlike prior work, our method offers a theoretical framework for
neuro-symbolic reasoning that leverages an LLM's knowledge while preserving the
underlying logic's soundness and completeness properties.

Result: 微调后的模型性能超越更大规模的模型，但非推理模型或人工标注的CoT数据效果较差。

Conclusion: 高质量的专家CoT数据难以复制，但少量精心设计的人工标注数据仍能激活基础模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in
diverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
traces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning
traces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like
DeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without
fine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be
induced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20
long CoT examples from the reasoning model \texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly
fine-tune the base model \texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms
the much larger \texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of
high-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further
explore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced
with prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However,
neither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that
certain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze
key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and
answer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain,
we are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small
quantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models. We release our
human-authored dataset across refinement stages and invite further
investigation into what makes small-scale reasoning supervision so effective.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) systems combine neural network and
classical symbolic AI mechanisms to exploit the complementary strengths of
large scale, generalizable learning and robust, verifiable reasoning. Numerous
classifications of neurosymbolic AI illustrate how these two components can be
integrated in distinctly different ways. In this work, we propose
reinterpreting instruction tuned large language models as model grounded
symbolic AI systems where natural language serves as the symbolic layer and
grounding is achieved through the models internal representation space. Within
this framework, we investigate and develop novel learning and reasoning
approaches that preserve structural similarities to traditional learning and
reasoning paradigms. Preliminary evaluations across axiomatic deductive
reasoning procedures of varying complexity provide insights into the
effectiveness of our approach in improving learning efficiency and reasoning
reliability.

Method: 构建包含4,000个专家级问题的VerifyBench，设计四维实验框架比较专业验证器和通用LLM的性能。

Conclusion: 验证器技术存在瓶颈，需进一步优化输入结构和跨领域能力，为RLVR发展提供关键见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback. A critical challenge
is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference
answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced.
Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based
verifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM
judges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building
better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers'
performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable
development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address
this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for
systematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions
covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is
equipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the
evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a
multidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental
framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized
verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs.
complete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers
fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve
leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show
stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover
verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in
cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks
of current verifier technology.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OMDPG算法通过引入最优边际Q函数和广义Q批评器，解决了异构多智能体强化学习中单调改进与部分参数共享的冲突，实验证明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构多智能体强化学习（MARL）中，单调改进对性能提升至关重要，但部分参数共享（ParPS）与现有方法（如HAPPO）存在冲突，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出OMDPG算法：1) 用最优边际Q函数替代顺序计算的Q函数；2) 引入广义Q批评器优化Q值估计；3) 采用集中式批评器分组执行器架构（CCGA）。

Result: 在SMAC和MAMuJoCo环境中，OMDPG优于多种最先进的MARL基线方法。

Conclusion: OMDPG成功解决了单调改进与ParPS的冲突，为异构MARL提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving
monotonic improvement plays a pivotal role in enhancing performance. The HAPPO
algorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update
scheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS).
However, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing
(ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our
experiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update
scheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to
achieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and
ParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)
algorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$
with the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\phi_{\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived
from Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating
the conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential
policy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC)
as the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to
optimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for
OMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a
Centralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously
achieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function
computation. Experimental results in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments demonstrate
that OMDPG outperforms various state-of-the-art MARL baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于意图和意向性在科技领域的研究较少，论文旨在提供一种低成本、实用的方法来理解和识别数据中的潜在意向性。

Method: 利用Promise Theory的语义时空模型，通过多尺度异常检测和时空一致性分析，将内容分为“意图”和“背景”。

Result: 该方法能以极低的计算成本识别数据中的潜在意向性，适用于基本生物体，无需大规模人工概率批量处理。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种简单但实用的方法，为理解数据中的意向性提供了新的视角，但其概念形成能力受限于代理的记忆容量。

Abstract: Since Searle's work deconstructing intent and intentionality in the realm of
philosophy, the practical meaning of intent has received little attention in
science and technology. Intentionality and context are both central to the
scope of Promise Theory's model of Semantic Spacetime, used as an effective
Tiny Language Model. One can identify themes and concepts from a text, on a low
level (without knowledge of the specific language) by using process coherence
as a guide. Any agent process can assess superficially a degree of latent
`intentionality' in data by looking for anomalous multi-scale anomalies and
assessing the work done to form them. Scale separation can be used to sort
parts into `intended' content and `ambient context', using the spacetime
coherence as a measure. This offers an elementary but pragmatic interpretation
of latent intentionality for very low computational cost, and without reference
to extensive training or reasoning capabilities. The process is well within the
reach of basic organisms as it does not require large scale artificial
probabilistic batch processing. The level of concept formation depends,
however, on the memory capacity of the agent.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning has demonstrated remarkable deep reasoning
capabilities in both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, its reliability is often undermined by the
accumulation of errors in intermediate steps. This paper introduces an novel
approach to calibrate the CoT reasoning accuracy by leveraging the model's
intrinsic veracity encoding. We discover that specific attention head
activations reliably reflect the truthfulness of reasoning steps in CoT. Based
on this insight, we train a confidence predictor to evaluate the correctness of
each reasoning step using these truthfulness-sensitive activations, dynamically
selecting the most plausible reasoning path via beam search. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., Few-Shot CoT, Self-Consistency, and
Self-Evaluation Guided Beam Search) across the mathematical, symbolic, and
commonsense reasoning tasks, exhibiting superior accuracy and reliability in
both unimodal and multimodal settings. We further validate the approach on
large reasoning models, confirming its applicability to specialized reasoning
models. Additionally, we explore the role of the model's self-correction
ability in CoT reasoning. This work provides a novel reliability improvement
path for CoT reasoning with broad application potential.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)
can automatically translate SPARQL between popular Knowledge Graph (KG)

later on DBLP and OpenAlex KG. This study addresses a notable gap in KG
interoperability research by rigorously evaluating LLM performance on
SPARQL-to-SPARQL translation. Two benchmarks are assembled, where the first
align 100 DBpedia-Wikidata queries from QALD-9-Plus; the second contains 100
DBLP queries aligned to OpenAlex, testing generalizability beyond encyclopaedic
KGs. Three open LLMs: Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, and
Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 are selected based on their sizes and architectures
and tested with zero-shot, few-shot, and two chain-of-thought variants. Outputs
were compared with gold answers, and resulting errors were categorized. We find
that the performance varies markedly across models and prompting strategies,
and that translations for Wikidata to DBpedia work far better than translations
for DBpedia to Wikidata.

Abstract: In computational argumentation, gradual semantics are fine-grained
alternatives to extension-based and labelling-based semantics . They ascribe a
dialectical strength to (components of) arguments sanctioning their degree of
acceptability. Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract,
bipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as,
to a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this
has not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it
being a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications
where gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and
propose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which
are the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths. To do
so, we use bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of
(potentially non-flat) ABA frameworks and generalise state-of-the-art modular
gradual semantics for QBAFs. We show that our gradual ABA semantics satisfy
suitable adaptations of desirable properties of gradual QBAF semantics, such as
balance and monotonicity. We also explore an argument-based approach that
leverages established QBAF modular semantics directly, and use it as baseline.
Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic ABA frameworks to compare our
gradual ABA semantics with its argument-based counterpart and assess
convergence.

Motivation: 随着AI系统的能力增强和普及，确保其安全性变得至关重要，但现有工具无法单独提供全面保障，需要集成化的方法。

Method: 提出了BlueGlass框架，提供统一基础设施以整合和组合多样化的安全工具，覆盖模型内部和输出。

Result: 通过三项分析验证了框架的实用性：分布评估、基于探针的层次动态分析和稀疏自编码器识别可解释概念。

Conclusion: BlueGlass为构建更稳健可靠的AI系统提供了基础架构和发现。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly capable and ubiquitous, ensuring the safety
of these systems is critical. However, existing safety tools often target
different aspects of model safety and cannot provide full assurance in
isolation, highlighting a need for integrated and composite methodologies. This
paper introduces BlueGlass, a framework designed to facilitate composite AI
safety workflows by providing a unified infrastructure enabling the integration
and composition of diverse safety tools that operate across model internals and
outputs. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of this framework, we present
three safety-oriented analyses on vision-language models for the task of object
detection: (1) distributional evaluation, revealing performance trade-offs and
potential failure modes across distributions; (2) probe-based analysis of layer
dynamics highlighting shared hierarchical learning via phase transition; and
(3) sparse autoencoders identifying interpretable concepts. More broadly, this
work contributes foundational infrastructure and findings for building more
robust and reliable AI systems.

analyze the compared models also through this lense. The aim is to understand
available techniques capable of orchestrating such application migration in
emerging computing continuum environments.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用人类心理学中的元认知提示（如“你可能是错的吗？”）来减少大型语言模型（LLM）中的偏见，展示了这种方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM仍在发展中，当前的偏见问题可能随时间变化，因此需要通用的去偏见策略。人类决策中的去偏见方法为此提供了灵感。

Method: 采用人类决策文献中的元认知提示（如“你可能是错的吗？”）来引导LLM反思其回答中的偏见和错误。

Result: 元认知提示能有效引导LLM揭示初始回答中未提及的偏见、错误和矛盾信息，改善模型输出。

Conclusion: 人类心理学为提示工程提供了新思路，利用元认知提示可显著提升LLM的自我反思和去偏见能力。

Abstract: Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing. Because they are still in development,
what is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies
for debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for
debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they
incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge
into awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of
information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and
contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if
prompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making
literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show
promise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?"
Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional
information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,
contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their
initial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and
users interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a
set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including
implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. "Could you be
wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent
metacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing
but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive
prompt. In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for
prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based
improvements to human decision making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在野火监测中至关重要，但现有的深度强化学习方法（如DRL）存在采样效率低、仿真与现实的差距以及训练复杂等问题，不适合时间敏感的应用。

Method: FRSICL利用自然语言任务描述和环境反馈，动态生成数据收集计划和飞行速度控制，无需大量重新训练。

Result: 仿真结果显示，FRSICL在最小化平均AoI方面优于PPO和最近邻基线方法。

Conclusion: FRSICL是一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，适用于无人机辅助的野火监测系统。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are vital for public safety, particularly in
wildfire monitoring, where early detection minimizes environmental impact. In
UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems, joint optimization of sensor
transmission scheduling and velocity is critical for minimizing Age of
Information (AoI) from stale sensor data. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
been used for such optimization; however, its limitations such as low sampling
efficiency, simulation-to-reality gaps, and complex training render it
unsuitable for time-critical applications like wildfire monitoring. This paper
introduces a new online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled
In-Context Learning (FRSICL) to jointly optimize the UAV's flight control and
data collection schedule along the trajectory in real time, thereby
asymptotically minimizing the average AoI across ground sensors. In contrast to
DRL, FRSICL generates data collection schedules and controls velocity using
natural language task descriptions and feedback from the environment, enabling
dynamic decision-making without extensive retraining. Simulation results
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed FRSICL compared to Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出多智能体强化学习（MARL）在动态现实环境中的适应性评估框架，以解决其实际部署的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实多智能体系统（MAS）的复杂性和动态性限制了MARL的实际应用，需评估其适应变化的能力。

Method: 提出适应性概念，并构建包含学习适应性、策略适应性和场景驱动适应性的三维框架。

Result: 通过适应性视角，支持更系统的MARL性能评估，超越传统基准测试。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于开发更适合动态现实MAS的MARL算法。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown clear effectiveness in
coordinating multiple agents across simulated benchmarks and constrained
scenarios. However, its deployment in real-world multi-agent systems (MAS)
remains limited, primarily due to the complex and dynamic nature of such
environments. These challenges arise from multiple interacting sources of
variability, including fluctuating agent populations, evolving task goals, and
inconsistent execution conditions. Together, these factors demand that MARL
algorithms remain effective under continuously changing system configurations
and operational demands. To better capture and assess this capacity for
adjustment, we introduce the concept of \textit{adaptability} as a unified and
practically grounded lens through which to evaluate the reliability of MARL
algorithms under shifting conditions, broadly referring to any changes in the
environment dynamics that may occur during learning or execution. Centred on
the notion of adaptability, we propose a structured framework comprising three
key dimensions: learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven
adaptability. By adopting this adaptability perspective, we aim to support more
principled assessments of MARL performance beyond narrowly defined benchmarks.
Ultimately, this survey contributes to the development of algorithms that are
better suited for deployment in dynamic, real-world multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动饮食评估系统常忽略非视觉因素（如成分替代对营养的影响）和个性化需求（如过敏、文化习惯）。瑞士缺乏整合相关营养信息的集中资源。

Method: 构建SwissFKG，结合LLM增强图谱内容，并评估四种LLM的表现。开发Graph-RAG应用展示图谱在回答用户营养查询中的作用。

Result: LLM能有效丰富图谱营养信息。SwissFKG提供成分级信息（如过敏原）和营养指南，支持个性化查询。

Conclusion: SwissFKG为融合视觉、上下文和文化维度的下一代饮食评估工具提供了基础。

Abstract: AI has driven significant progress in the nutrition field, especially through
multimedia-based automatic dietary assessment. However, existing automatic
dietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as
recipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter
nutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including
allergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In
Switzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains
fragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant
nutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we
introduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our
best knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with
nutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national
nutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment
pipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first
benchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge
augmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the
graph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe
recommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and
dietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional
guidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the
SwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer
user-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by
comparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers. As such,
our work lays the foundation for the next generation of dietary assessment
tools that blend visual, contextual, and cultural dimensions of eating.

Motivation: 探讨决策变换器（DT）在稀疏奖励环境中的适用性，并验证更简单的FBC方法是否更具优势。

Method: 在Robomimic和D4RL基准上实验比较DT和FBC的性能，FBC通过过滤低质量轨迹后进行行为克隆。

Result: FBC在稀疏奖励环境中表现优于DT，且更高效。

Conclusion: DT在稀疏奖励环境中并非优选，其适用性受到质疑。

Abstract: In recent years, extensive work has explored the application of the
Transformer architecture to reinforcement learning problems. Among these,
Decision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of
offline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned
policy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al.
(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based
offline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative
Q-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in
sparse-reward and low-quality data settings.
  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks
(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered
Behavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
DT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing
trajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on
the filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also
requires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results
therefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments.
From prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward
environments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?

Abstract: Research into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for data analysis
tasks suffer from a large number of contradictions and lack of concrete design
recommendations stemming from gaps in understanding the tasks that require AI
assistance. In this paper, we drew on multiple fields such as visual analytics,
cognition, and dashboard design to propose a method for categorising and
comparing XAI studies under three dimensions: what, why, and who. We identified
the main problems as: inadequate descriptions of tasks, context-free studies,
and insufficient testing with target users. We propose that studies should
specifically report on their users' domain, AI, and data analysis expertise to
illustrate the generalisability of their findings. We also propose study
guidelines for designing and reporting XAI tasks to improve the XAI community's
ability to parse the rapidly growing field. We hope that our contribution can
help researchers and designers better identify which studies are most relevant
to their work, what gaps exist in the research, and how to handle contradictory
results regarding XAI design.

Semantic Understanding, C3: Table Retrieval and Compression, C4: Executable
Reasoning with Traceability, and C5: Cross-Domain Generalization--to analyze
and compare current approaches. In addition, a detailed examination of the

actionable insights to improve the robustness, generalization, and efficiency
of LLM-based Table Agents in practical settings.

Abstract: School dropout is a serious problem in distance learning, where early
detection is crucial for effective intervention and student perseverance.
Predicting student dropout using available educational data is a widely
researched topic in learning analytics. Our partner's distance learning
platform highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources,
including socio-demographic data, behavioral data, and sentiment analysis, to
accurately predict dropout risks. In this paper, we introduce a novel model
that combines sentiment analysis of student comments using the Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with socio-demographic
and behavioral data analyzed through Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We
fine-tuned BERT on student comments to capture nuanced sentiments, which were
then merged with key features selected using feature importance techniques in
XGBoost. Our model was tested on unseen data from the next academic year,
achieving an accuracy of 84\%, compared to 82\% for the baseline model.
Additionally, the model demonstrated superior performance in other metrics,
such as precision and F1-score. The proposed method could be a vital tool in
developing personalized strategies to reduce dropout rates and encourage
student perseverance

Abstract: The ability to transfer knowledge from prior experiences to novel tasks
stands as a pivotal capability of intelligent agents, including both humans and
computational models. This principle forms the basis of transfer learning,
where large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream
tasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of
task adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where,
due to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational
models is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational
immunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our
work focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of
priors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we
demonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on
non-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that
our hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire
more generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model
Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene
generation, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a
handful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We
then extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel
scenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed
scenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a
pre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction,
addressing critical challenges in computational immunology

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VIL的视角不变学习策略，用于增强视觉语言导航在连续环境中的鲁棒性，通过对比学习和师生框架实现，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言导航中导航策略对视角变化敏感的问题，提出V2-VLNCE场景和VIL方法。

Method: 采用对比学习框架学习稀疏且视角不变的特征，并引入师生框架优化Waypoint Predictor Module，通过端到端训练联合优化。

Result: 在V2-VLNCE上性能提升8-15%，在标准VLNCE设置下也表现优异，尤其在RxR-CE数据集上达到最优。

Conclusion: VIL是一种即插即用的后训练方法，既能提升视角变化的鲁棒性，又不影响标准视角性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent
follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research
problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to
viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that
alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized
scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View
Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the
robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL
employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant
features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the
Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a
view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student
model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these
components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets
R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE
setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often
still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method
also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to
other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the
standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training
method.

Method: 开发了一种基于面部生物特征异常模式的机器学习技术。

Result: 在大规模数据集上评估了该技术，并验证了其对视频篡改的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测深度伪造视频，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually
compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it
relatively easy to create a video of anyone saying anything. Today, such
deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political
disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the
detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in
facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of
deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to
video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake
generators.

*Mahdiyar Molahasani,Azadeh Motamedi,Michael Greenspan,Il-Min Kim,Ali Etemad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一种无需数据且任务无关的方法，用于减少视觉语言模型（如CLIP）中的隐式偏差，通过两阶段方法生成场景描述并学习投影以减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）常因训练数据中的偏差而产生偏斜预测，PRISM旨在无需额外数据或预定义偏差类别的情况下解决这一问题。

Method: PRISM分两阶段：1）用LLM生成包含虚假相关性的场景描述；2）使用对比式去偏差损失学习投影，将嵌入映射到减少虚假相关性的潜在空间。

Result: PRISM在Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上优于现有去偏差方法。

Conclusion: PRISM提供了一种有效且通用的去偏差解决方案，代码已公开。

Abstract: We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in
vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for
bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in
their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias
VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data.
It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts
to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM
uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps
the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while
preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the
commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合时空和运动学信息的HMR-ViT方法，通过构建时空-运动学特征图像并使用Vision Transformer，显著提升了人体网格恢复的准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有HMR方法仅利用时空或运动学信息，缺乏同时利用两者的方法，导致性能受限。

Method: 构建时空-运动学特征图像，使用通道重排矩阵（CRM）优化特征排列，通过Vision Transformer和回归网络推断SMPL参数。

Result: 在3DPW和Human3.6M数据集上表现优异，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HMR-ViT通过结合时空和运动学信息，显著提升了人体网格恢复的准确性。

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of
the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either
temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but
there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human
Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account
both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic
Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames
by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel
Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located
spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using
Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred
using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M
datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

Motivation: 解决在无法直接测量的情况下，通过视觉观测表征颗粒材料特性的问题。

Method: 生成合成实验数据，用NeRF重建3D几何，MPM模拟未知摩擦角，通过贝叶斯优化最小化图像损失。

Result: 摩擦角估计误差在2度以内，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为颗粒材料特性表征提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material
properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating
synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The
experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations.
These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state
and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct
the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability
to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The
reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for
the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images
of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed
images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to
estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction
angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the
effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This
approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in
real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.

Result: 在开放词汇图像分割领域的两个基准数据集上，通过定量和定性分析验证了VISTA的有效性。

Conclusion: VISTA通过提升数据质量，显著增强了多模态模型在下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA)
have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model
performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object
detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less
studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This
is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a
considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited
metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or
apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the
full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the
performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain
of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data
validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify,
understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through
detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate
VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

Motivation: 类别不平衡数据导致尾部类别图像合成多样性不足，需在不影响头部类别的情况下提升尾部类别多样性。

Method: 引入无监督InfoNCE损失和MSE损失，通过对比学习和条件-无条件对齐增强尾部类别多样性。

Result: 方法在多个数据集（如CIFAR10/100-LT等）上优于标准DDPM和其他替代方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架简单有效，成功应用于类别不平衡扩散模型，显著提升尾部类别多样性。

Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a
long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an
imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images
for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced
data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising
the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing
two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions.
Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to
increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for
tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss
is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional
generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process
insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail
classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional
alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are
the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully
leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our
contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard
DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across
various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and
ImageNetLT.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）和多模态扩展（MLLMs）在视频理解方面取得进展，但处理超长视频时仍面临计算、内存和时序一致性问题。

Method: 提出将无限视频理解作为研究方向，强调需要创新的流式架构、持久内存机制、分层表示和事件中心推理。

Result: 论文未提供具体实验结果，但提出了未来研究的核心挑战和方向。

Conclusion: 无限视频理解是多媒体和AI研究的重要目标，需跨领域合作推动技术创新。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding.
However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and
comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent
efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for
extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and
VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive
contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant
computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual
tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence,
tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended
periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning
systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical,
albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video
Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand,
and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We
argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research
objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI,
research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming
architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive
representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms.
Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and
several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research
directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

Result: 在Qwen2-VL等模型上测试，FLOPs减少32%-41%，准确率变化在-2%到+2%之间。

Conclusion: BlindSight是一种高效且无需训练的方法，显著减少VLM推理的计算开销。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and
images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt
length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this
results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck
is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our
analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion
of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink
tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct
categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on
this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference
using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a
dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention
head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL,
Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on
average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated
multi-image understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion aims to estimate continuous surface
variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from
satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon
accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems
and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way
to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper
systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques,
from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods
(e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models
(e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application
scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM
advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and
cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical
interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty
quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation
foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling
capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过可控生成视频模型的因果提示是一种高效且可扩展的光流提取方法。

Abstract: Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem.
Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen
self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be
prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or
illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical
for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a
sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,
which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer
perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we
extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular
architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner
is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future
frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat
each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that
can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely
present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.
Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that
injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one
step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and
unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS
dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid
Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual
prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective
alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

Abstract: With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities
including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to
the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why
the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc
visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing
from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces
saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual
information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear
combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal
interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim
to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model
inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all
state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of
qualitative and quantitative measures. The implementation of proposed method

Conclusion: 有效整合领域专家知识（如眼动信息）可显著增强通用模型在临床任务中的能力，RadEyeVideo为医学图像分析提供了可扩展的人本方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance
in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several
studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or
textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of
eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the
areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we
propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists'
eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial
dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and
disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video
input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance
improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for
both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an
open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs
such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work
highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case),
when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance
general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step
toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image
analytics.

Result: 实验表明，PointSD能有效提升点云自监督学习性能。

Conclusion: 利用大规模预训练的扩散模型可以显著增强3D点云表示学习。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven
effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been
extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point
generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains
constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D
datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of
text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is
trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the
SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text
encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that
allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the
trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input
and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D
backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating
direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud
tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point
cloud self-supervised learning. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 传统自回归方法在推理阶段无法避免误差累积，而扩散模型因迭代性质不适用于实时任务。

Method: 采用混合自回归和扩散模型的方法，设计多尺度姿态表示模块和置信感知因果注意力机制。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和How2Sign数据集上验证了方法的生成质量和实时流效率。

Conclusion: 混合方法有效结合了两种模型的优势，提升了手语生成的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on
autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently
provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can
prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of
error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that
stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage
step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the
iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire
sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it,
we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP
for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential
dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body
movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately
extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a
Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal
Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically
guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive
experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI检测模型在真实世界中的性能因环境干扰（如遮挡、噪声等）而下降，缺乏针对鲁棒性的评估标准。

Method: 提出了RoHOI基准，包含20种干扰类型，并设计了SAMPL策略，通过动态调整模型优化来学习鲁棒特征。

Result: 实验表明SAMPL策略显著提升了模型在干扰条件下的性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RoHOI为HOI检测的鲁棒性评估提供了新标准，SAMPL策略有效提升了模型在复杂环境中的表现。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human
assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean
datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions,
leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first
robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under
diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with
environmental variability, occlusion, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes
20 corruption types based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new
robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the
related field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To
improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive
Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic
and partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance
robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.

*Linlan Huang,Xusheng Cao,Haori Lu,Yifan Meng,Fei Yang,Xialei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出MG-CLIP方法，通过分析CLIP模型中的模态间隙变化，改进其在持续学习中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用CLIP模型在持续学习中的潜力，并解决现有方法忽视模态间隙的问题。

Method: 提出MG-CLIP方法，通过保持模态间隙减少遗忘，并通过补偿模态间隙增强新数据学习能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且无需额外回放数据。

Conclusion: 模态间隙是持续学习中的关键因素，MG-CLIP方法简单有效。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from
continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned
tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting
strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing
interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most
existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its
generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in
the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models.
Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent
to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we
propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's
performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap
preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance
the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective
for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring
additional replay data. Our code is available at

*Zhiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DAA*的新方法，通过引入路径角度自由度（PAF）改进A*算法，提升路径平滑性和相似性，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路径平滑性在模仿学习中被忽视，需要一种方法在路径相似性和平滑性之间找到平衡。

Method: 结合PAF的DAA*算法，通过联合优化路径缩短和平滑性（分别对应启发式距离和PAF）来改进路径最优性。

Result: 在7个数据集上验证，DAA*在路径相似性上显著优于神经A*和TransPath，SPR、ASIM和PSIM指标分别提升9.0%、6.9%和3.9%。

Conclusion: DAA*在路径最优性和搜索效率之间取得平衡，显著提升了模仿学习中的路径生成质量。

Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed
deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom
(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The
PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding
the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high
adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely
aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening
and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.
Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,
2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2
scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in
path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path
length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,
and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path
loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also
discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where
applicable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到动作生成方法受限于短文本或通用提示，缺乏细粒度控制和泛化能力。

Method: 提出SnapMoGen数据集，包含20K动作片段和122K详细文本描述；改进MoMask++模型，使用多尺度标记序列和单一生成掩码变换器。

Result: MoMask++在HumanML3D和SnapMoGen基准测试中达到最优性能，并能处理用户输入的随意提示。

Conclusion: SnapMoGen和MoMask++为文本到动作生成提供了更细粒度的控制和更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent
years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from
short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This
limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen
prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset
featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive
textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,
accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per
description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips
preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,
facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also
improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,
MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better
exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single
generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the
ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs
to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于提示的单目深度估计框架，用于生成高分辨率数字高程模型（DEM），显著提升了分辨率（从30米到30厘米），并在多种地形中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率高程估计对水文、城市形态和生态系统研究至关重要，但现有方法（如超分辨率技术和单目深度估计）存在局限性。

Method: 利用低分辨率SRTM数据作为提示，结合高分辨率RGB图像，通过微调视觉变换器编码器实现DEM估计、填补和更新。

Result: 框架实现了100倍分辨率提升，误差低于5米，优于SRTM达18%，适用于水文和环境研究。

Conclusion: 该框架具有强泛化能力和可扩展性，为全球高程测绘提供了新范式。

Abstract: High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment
and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the
growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning
approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have
been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and
monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its
conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of
prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract
estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a
framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for
absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and
high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program
(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived
DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM
estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x
resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of
magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust
generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with
< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological
analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We
demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.
and Israel. All code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseLLM提出了一种基于大型语言模型的姿态估计框架，通过非线性MLP视觉语言连接器提升定位精度，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统姿态估计方法依赖关键点先验，泛化能力有限；语言引导方法如LocLLM的线性投影器无法捕捉复杂空间-文本交互。

Method: PoseLLM用非线性MLP替换线性投影器，实现跨模态特征分层转换，增强视觉与文本描述的融合。

Result: 在COCO验证集上达到77.8 AP，优于LocLLM 0.4 AP，同时在Human-Art和MPII上保持强零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 非线性连接器显著提升定位精度且不牺牲泛化能力，推动了语言引导姿态估计的先进水平。

Abstract: Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode
keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen
keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint
localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization
through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to
capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision
localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language
Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector
with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP
with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation,
enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions.
Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO
validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong
zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a
simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization
accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in
language-guided pose estimation. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Spatial Lifting（SL）的新方法，通过将输入提升到更高维度（如3D）并使用相应网络处理，在密集预测任务中表现优异，同时减少模型参数和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密集预测方法通常计算成本高且模型参数多，SL旨在通过维度提升实现高效、准确的预测。

Method: 将2D输入（如图像）提升到更高维度（如3D），并使用对应维度的网络（如3D U-Net）处理，生成结构化输出。

Result: 在19个基准数据集（13个语义分割和6个深度估计）上验证，模型参数减少98%以上，推理成本降低，性能仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: SL为密集预测任务提供了一种高效、准确且可靠的新范式。

Abstract: We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction
tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a
higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks
designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively,
this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark
tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and
significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework
produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This
emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables
robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time.
We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic
segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense
prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in
the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new
vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient,
accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.

*Zhimin Liao,Ping Wei,Ruijie Zhang,Shuaijia Chen,Haoxuan Wang,Ziyang Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为$I^{2}$-World的高效4D占用预测框架，通过解耦场景标记化实现动态3D场景建模，性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中3D场景演化的预测和生成问题，尤其是处理复杂3D场景的标记化挑战。

Method: 采用双标记器设计（场景内和场景间），结合编码器-解码器架构，实现高效4D占用预测。

Result: 在4D占用预测任务中，mIoU和IoU分别提升25.1%和36.9%，训练内存仅需2.9GB，推理速度达37.0FPS。

Conclusion: $I^{2}$-World在性能和效率上均表现出色，为自动驾驶系统提供了强大的场景建模工具。

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via
occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner
cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized
image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a
critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose
$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method
decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The
intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to
hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The
inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across
timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while
retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only
GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and
predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene
generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,
ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that
$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while
exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of
training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS. Our code is

*Tao Tang,Chengxu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPNet提出了一种基于内容自适应卷积的遥感图像融合方法，通过RAPConv和PAN-DFF模块提升空间细节和光谱保真度，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在遥感图像融合中因卷积核均匀应用而忽略局部内容变化，限制了性能。

Method: RAPNet采用RAPConv生成空间自适应卷积核，并结合PAN-DFF模块通过注意力机制平衡空间细节与光谱保真度。

Result: 在公开数据集上，RAPNet在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，消融实验验证了自适应组件的有效性。

Conclusion: RAPNet通过自适应卷积和动态特征融合，显著提升了遥感图像融合的精度和效果。

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution
panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to
generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the
effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently
constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all
spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this
issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive
convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive
Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive
kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of
spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the
Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an
attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail
enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly
available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared
to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the
effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为稳定分数蒸馏（SSD）的新框架，通过简化优化过程提升文本引导图像和3D编辑的稳定性和对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Delta Denoising Score在稳定性、空间控制和编辑强度方面存在不足，主要由于依赖复杂的辅助结构导致优化信号冲突和局部编辑受限。

Method: SSD通过固定一个分类器到源提示，利用Classifier-Free Guidance（CFG）方程实现跨提示对齐，并引入常数项空文本分支稳定优化过程。此外，还加入了提示增强分支以提升编辑强度。

Result: SSD在2D和3D编辑任务（如NeRF和文本驱动风格编辑）中取得了最先进的结果，具有更快的收敛速度和更低的复杂度。

Conclusion: SSD为文本引导编辑提供了一个高效且稳健的解决方案，能够保持原始内容结构并实现平滑的提示特定修改。

Abstract: Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models,
yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial
control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex
auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and
restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation
(SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the
editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt.
Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves
cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to
stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original
content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned
with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while
maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a
prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style
transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D
editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster
convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution
for text-guided editing.

Abstract: Depth information is robust to scene appearance variations and inherently
carries 3D spatial details. In this paper, a visual backbone based on the
vision transformer is proposed to fuse RGB and depth modalities for enhancing
generalization. Different modalities are first processed by separate CNN stems,
and the combined convolutional features are delivered to the scalable vision
transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive
unsupervised learning scheme is designed with masked and unmasked tokens to
accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning progress.
For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to

Result: 实验表明LGSP-Prompt在多个FSCIL基准测试中达到最优性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LGSP-Prompt通过空间提示解决了FSCIL中的性能下降问题，为增量学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data
scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based
prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental
learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper
presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,
revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.
Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from
token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for
task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,
we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively
shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial
dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining
local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight
key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling
dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively
learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing
significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental
learning. Our implementation is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中的幻觉问题主要由多模态特征未对齐引起，而RoPE的长距离衰减加剧了这一问题。

Method: 提出基于曼哈顿距离的MCA-LLaVA，将一维序列顺序与二维空间位置结合建模，改善图像-指令交互。

Result: 实验表明MCA-LLaVA在幻觉和通用基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MCA-LLaVA通过优化空间位置建模，有效缓解了图像对齐偏差，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models
(LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key
contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term
decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in
LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction
tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions
within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the
bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are
positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to
insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.
We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's
perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose
MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a
two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the
one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image
tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image
alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination
and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景理解在自动驾驶、监控和体育分析等应用中需求迫切，但现有方法在空间细节和时序一致性上表现不足。

Method: 提出THYME方法，结合层次特征聚合和循环时序优化，建模多尺度空间上下文并保持时序一致性。

Result: 在ASPIRe和AeroEye-v1.0数据集上，THYME优于现有方法，提升了场景理解的准确性。

Conclusion: THYME方法有效解决了动态场景图生成的挑战，为复杂场景理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving,
surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic
scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and
early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer
from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial
details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME)
approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation
with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular,
THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal
consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In
addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with
five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets
and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation.
Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that
the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering
improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

thickness and stiffness of a structure from just a video of waves on its
surface. Our method works by extracting a dispersion relation from the video
and then solving a physics-based optimization problem to find the best-fitting
thickness and stiffness parameters. We validate our method on both simulated
and real data, in both cases showing strong agreement with ground-truth
measurements. Our technique provides a proof-of-concept for at-home health
monitoring of medically-informative tissue properties, and it is further
applicable to fields such as human-computer interaction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Expert-CFG的专家参与框架，无需额外训练即可将医学视觉语言模型与临床专业知识对齐，显著提升了性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学视觉语言模型存在概率不确定性，可能产生错误或未经核实的回答，影响医疗应用。现有方法依赖训练，成本高且临床对齐不足。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the
development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress,
current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing
erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical
applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision
Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with
high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these
training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment
with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an
expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance
(Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional
training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to
identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist
experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to
refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are
correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical
visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG,
with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms
state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for
clinical use.

Conclusion: S3AD算法和KITTI-AR数据集为3D异常检测提供了有效的解决方案，增强了模型在开放场景中的适用性。

Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving,
with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to
open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,
3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect
anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the
generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes
and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D
detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the
insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This
paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,
which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the
generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an
anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving
target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the
generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize
two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named
KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k
pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories
as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.
Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not
used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely
for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm
and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be
obtained at https://github.com/xxxx/xxx).

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模全景图像数据集，现有任务依赖二维预训练模型，但这些模型无法处理全景图像的失真和间断问题。

Method: 采用基于预训练模型权重的球形离散采样方法，减少失真并获得良好初始训练值；应用于全景图像分割任务。

Result: 在Stanford2D3D室内数据集上取得了良好效果。

Conclusion: 球形采样方法有效解决了全景图像处理中的失真问题，并提升了任务性能。

Abstract: Due to the current lack of large-scale datasets at the million-scale level,
tasks involving panoramic images predominantly rely on existing two-dimensional
pre-trained image benchmark models as backbone networks. However, these
networks are not equipped to recognize the distortions and discontinuities
inherent in panoramic images, which adversely affects their performance in such
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical sampling method for
panoramic images that enables the direct utilization of existing pre-trained
models developed for two-dimensional images. Our method employs spherical
discrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively
mitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values.
Additionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image
segmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for
specific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used
indoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在线点跟踪方法Track-On，利用视觉基础模型和Transformer架构，在无需未来帧信息的情况下实现长期跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景需要在线预测，但现有方法多为离线处理，无法满足实时需求。视觉基础模型虽缺乏时序推理，但能提供稳健的空间特征。

Method: 结合视觉基础模型和Transformer架构，提出Track-On模型，将每个跟踪点视为查询，逐帧处理视频。

Result: Track-On在七个公开基准测试中达到新最优性能，证明了无需未来帧信息的长期跟踪可行性。

Conclusion: Track-On为在线点跟踪提供了有效解决方案，展示了视觉基础模型与Transformer结合在时序任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames
and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation
supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by
enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term
tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are
available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,
real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate
causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in
streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based
on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes
essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,
offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack
temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines
to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term
point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially
without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating
the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they
can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.
However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design
is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this
causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across
frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that
treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.
Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,
demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StaRFM是一个统一框架，通过Fisher信息惩罚和置信度对齐惩罚，解决了基础模型在视觉分类和医学分割任务中的分布偏移和置信度不匹配问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型（如CLIP和SAM）在低样本迁移学习中表现出色，但面临训练与测试数据分布偏移和置信度不匹配问题，现有解决方案多为领域特定。

Method: 提出StaRFM框架，包含Fisher信息惩罚（FIP）和置信度不匹配惩罚（CMP），分别用于减少分布偏移和校准不确定性。

Result: 在19个视觉数据集和医学分割任务中，StaRFM显著提升了性能（如准确率+3.5%，DSC 84.7%），并降低了跨域性能差距。

Conclusion: StaRFM是一个即插即用的通用框架，可无缝集成到基础模型中，解决分布偏移和置信度问题。

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and
medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these
models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between
training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to
overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in
vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing
solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified
framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information
penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to
reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence
misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,
calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes
bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP
minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows
consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19
vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in
medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain
performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is
plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration
with foundation models. Code and models will be released at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从第一人称视角重建虚拟形象时的遮挡和身体比例失真问题，同时减少对多视角数据集的依赖。

Method: 使用ControlNet和Stable Diffusion框架，从遮挡的俯视图像生成真实的正视图，再输入到图像到动作模型中生成虚拟形象动作。

Result: 实现了从单张俯视图像生成真实正视图，并进一步生成虚拟形象动作，为更易用和泛化的远程呈现系统铺平道路。

Conclusion: 该方法首次利用生成先验从第一人称视角重建虚拟形象，显著减少了训练负担并提高了泛化能力。

Abstract: An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a
person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements
into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,
which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without
front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as
occlusions and distorted body proportions.
  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,
and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars
from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view
datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a
generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.
Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves
generalizability.
  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree
reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates
realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a
Stable Diffusion backbone.
  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic
frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables
generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more
accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

Abstract: Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer
vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets
and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However,
most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the
dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address
this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting
processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset
(PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting
process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes.
Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based
model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous
mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering
new insights into computational creativity and art education.

Conclusion: AGCD-Net通过因果干预和注意力校正，显著提升了情感识别的鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in
real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context
bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g.
associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces
\textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the
ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and
Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core
of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM),
which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious
correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face
features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust
emotion recognition in complex settings.

Conclusion: AAHR通过多策略结合有效解决了语义模糊和高阶关联问题，为图像-文本匹配提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer
vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face
challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among
similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft
positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft
negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching
uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the
neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training
batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.
This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning
framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified
representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,
effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework
introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive
aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic
understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and
inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships
among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic
interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum
contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined
strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between
features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,
considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The
code and model checkpoints for this research are available at

Conclusion: 提出的标记化和对齐策略显著提升了无注释手语翻译的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving
strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains
have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands,
raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language
datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization
framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into
discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up
to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage
and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic
modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective,
along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and
intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment
without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the
performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while
significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate
our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths,
validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in
computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven
characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated
event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance
inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the
performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using
RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this
case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In
this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only
leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the
cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge
distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our
method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and
CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current
State-of-the-Art methods. The code will be available at

Conclusion: Prompt4Trust通过自动化且符合人类需求的提示工程，显著提升了MLLMs在安全关键场景中的可信度。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for
applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical
settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,
and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As
clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of
its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high
confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting
confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce
context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate
responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive
accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically
prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy
clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically
motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task
accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)
performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice
questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework
trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot
generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for
scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work
demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering
for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings. Our

Abstract: Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind
motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by
the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which
leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue,
we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to
encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel.
Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as
a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point
for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD
solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the
aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel
generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing
BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.
Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion
deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmark datasets. The source code is available at

rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability
volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We
first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution
probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser
sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for
predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two
standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover,
we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as
room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 手术阶段识别对智能辅助系统至关重要，但RGB图像缺乏结构线索且视觉相似性高，深度信息可提供几何补充。

Conclusion: 深度信息显著提升手术阶段识别性能，Geo-RepNet为复杂手术场景提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent
assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic
Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across
different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant
challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can
complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships
and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth
information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a
geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth
information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes.
Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the
Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry
priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention
(GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and
efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level
annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed
dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and
low-texture surgical environments.

Motivation: Vision Transformers（ViTs）在少样本图像分类中的潜力未充分挖掘，ViT-ProtoNet旨在利用ViT-Small提升原型网络的性能。

Method: 通过平均少量支持样本的类别条件令牌嵌入构建鲁棒原型，并在5-shot设置下评估。

Conclusion: ViT-ProtoNet为少样本分类提供了强大且灵活的方法，并为基于Transformer的元学习设定了新基准。

Abstract: The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains
underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce
ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical
Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a
handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that
generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive
empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100,
CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess
robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based
prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot
accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space.
Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based
competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine
the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To
foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results
establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot
classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial
for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data
collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive
a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational
limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these
approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low
processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based
computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and
overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently
impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft
hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of
labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,
we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and
description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network
architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft
flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain
adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features
with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark
description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns
robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant
landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified
system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Method: 提出 ALPHA 基准测试，并开发 ALPHAVAE 模型，结合 alpha 混合、补丁级保真度、感知一致性和双重 KL 散度约束进行训练。

Result: ALPHAVAE 在仅使用 8K 图像训练的情况下，PSNR 提升 4.9 dB，SSIM 提升 3.2%，且透明图像生成效果更优。

Conclusion: ALPHAVAE 为 RGBA 图像生成提供了高效解决方案，并在透明图像生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results
in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress
and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation
of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due
to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the
first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to
four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further
introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB
VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a
composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction,
patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence
constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha
representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used
by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase
in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior
transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion
framework. Our code, data, and models are released on

Result: PAUC比传统指标更符合人类偏好，能更准确评估用户体验。

Conclusion: PAUC为主动交互场景提供了更可靠的评估方法。

Abstract: With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the
capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an
alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect
multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously
determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video
playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce
ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's
ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated
at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts
for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate
evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive
benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of
human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human
preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider
the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides
a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction
scenarios. Project homepage:

Motivation: 点云地点识别（PCPR）在自动驾驶等领域至关重要，但现有模型在持续学习时易受灾难性遗忘影响，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出LifelongPR框架，包括动态样本选择方法和基于提示学习的轻量级模块，分两阶段训练以减少遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在mIR@1和mR@1上分别提升6.50%和7.96%，遗忘率降低8.95%。

Conclusion: LifelongPR有效解决了PCPR中的持续学习问题，提升了模型的实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry
and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent
transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of
a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and
accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the
ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance
degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or
sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance
costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of
PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual
learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge
from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we
propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample
sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially
diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain
shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight
prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific
feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on
large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in
mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly
available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR.

Motivation: 现有音频-视频预训练方法仅关注整体模态对齐，忽略了通过认知归纳和对比强化易混淆类别的区分能力。

Method: 提出DICCAE编码器，动态调整类间混淆损失，并结合音频、视频及其融合模态的训练框架；采用聚类引导的自监督预训练策略缓解数据稀缺问题。

Result: 在VGGSound数据集上达到65.5%的top-1准确率，接近最先进水平，并通过消融实验验证了各模块的必要性。

Conclusion: DICCAE通过细粒度类别对齐和动态混淆损失，显著提升了音频-视频模型的性能，为易混淆活动的识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they
generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing
audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall
audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing
easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during
training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder
(DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained,
category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting
the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further
extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework
that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To
mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition
task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training
strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its
feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating
the necessity of each module.

Result: SF2D准确率99.19%，视觉识别准确率96.3%，导航系统成功率95%，综合准确率达99.99%。

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in
older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can
greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely
intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective
and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this
work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary
systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system
(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human
fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall
scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor
localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a
robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an
edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen
people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different
accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to
99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%
accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the
accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework
creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall
accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,
but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

Conclusion: Fast3D为3D MLLMs提供了一种高效且无需修改模型参数的视觉令牌剪枝解决方案。

Abstract: While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from
processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D
scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in
accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely
unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper,
we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in
object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in
2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for
identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these
observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework
for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention
Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the
global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token
importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual
token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through
attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise
pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques
operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive
evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,
particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available at

Abstract: Multispectral point cloud (MPC) captures 3D spatial-spectral information from
the observed scene, which can be used for scene understanding and has a wide
range of applications. However, most of the existing classification methods
were extensively tested on indoor datasets, and when applied to outdoor
datasets they still face problems including sparse labeled targets, differences
in land-covers scales, and long-tailed distributions. To address the above
issues, an enhanced classification method based on adaptive multi-scale fusion
for MPCs with long-tailed distributions is proposed. In the training set
generation stage, a grid-balanced sampling strategy is designed to reliably
generate training samples from sparse labeled datasets. In the feature learning
stage, a multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed to fuse shallow features
of land-covers at different scales, addressing the issue of losing fine
features due to scale variations in land-covers. In the classification stage,
an adaptive hybrid loss module is devised to utilize multi-classification heads
with adaptive weights to balance the learning ability of different classes,
improving the classification performance of small classes due to various-scales
and long-tailed distributions in land-covers. Experimental results on three MPC
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the
state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 使用简单的编码器架构和Video ViTs，研究不同预训练方法（弱监督、全监督、自监督MVM）及领域自适应预训练（DAPT）的效果。

Result: 强预训练使简单模型性能超越专用方法；自监督MVM表现最佳；DAPT进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 预训练是关键，简单架构结合有效预训练可实现高效、可扩展的TAD模型。

Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on
complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it
remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual
perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training,
allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs.
Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only
approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how
pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong
pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the
performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being
significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised
pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less
effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM)
provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on
unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without
requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of
pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be
built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code,
domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work:

Abstract: Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and
global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early
identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed
to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases
using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:
image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,
normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with
Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional
layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max
pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax
output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training
accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although
a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model
integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by
mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.
Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible
platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote
areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of
precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting
sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with
practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to
transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a

Abstract: Camera traps have long been used by wildlife researchers to monitor and study
animal behavior, population dynamics, habitat use, and species diversity in a
non-invasive and efficient manner. While data collection from the field has
increased with new tools and capabilities, methods to develop, process, and
manage the data, especially the adoption of ML/AI tools, remain challenging.
These challenges include the sheer volume of data generated, the need for
accurate labeling and annotation, variability in environmental conditions
affecting data quality, and the integration of ML/AI tools into existing
workflows that often require domain-specific customization and computational
resources. This paper provides a guide to a low-resource pipeline to process
camera trap data on-premise, incorporating ML/AI capabilities tailored for
small research groups with limited resources and computational expertise. By
focusing on practical solutions, the pipeline offers accessible approaches for
data transmission, inference, and evaluation, enabling researchers to discover
meaningful insights from their ever-increasing camera trap datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多人体运动预测因依赖个体历史运动和交互关系而复杂且计算成本高，需高效建模方法。

Method: 设计轻量级双分支分别学习局部和全局表示，引入跨层级交互块整合时空表示，并加入空间人际距离嵌入。

Result: 在CMU-Mocap、MuPoTS-3D和3DPW数据集上实现最优性能，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 通过高效时空设计，模型在多人体运动预测中表现出色且计算高效。

Abstract: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to
the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between
agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs
substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally
efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and
temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual
branches that learn local and global representations for individual and
multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level
interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from
both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly
incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient
temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for
multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while
significantly reducing the computational cost. Code is available at

### [105] [HMID-Net: An Exploration of Masked Image Modeling and Knowledge Distillation in Hyperbolic Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09487)
*Changli Wang,Fang Yin,Jiafeng Liu,Rui Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMID-Net提出了一种在双曲空间中结合掩码图像建模（MIM）和知识蒸馏的新方法，显著提升了视觉-语义层次结构的捕捉效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法MERU虽成功将多模态学习技术从欧几里得空间扩展到双曲空间，但如何更高效地训练模型以利用这种层次结构仍是一个关键问题。

Method: 提出HMID-Net，在双曲空间中整合MIM和知识蒸馏技术，并设计了一种新的蒸馏损失函数以优化知识传递。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在下游任务中表现优异，显著优于MERU和CLIP等现有模型。

Conclusion: HMID-Net证明了在双曲空间中应用MIM和知识蒸馏的可行性，为高效模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner.
For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study,
MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space
to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy.
However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model
to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the
\textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel
and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge
distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in
hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a
distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective
knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM
and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same
remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our
method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly
outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification
and retrieval.

*Lingfeng He,De Cheng,Zhiheng Ma,Huaijie Wang,Dingwen Zhang,Nannan Wang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CKAA框架通过双级知识对齐和任务信心引导的适配器混合，解决了PEFT-based CL方法在误导任务ID下的模糊决策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于独立训练的子模块导致特征子空间不对齐，现有方法在误导任务ID下表现不佳。

Method: 提出CKAA框架，包括双级知识对齐（DKA）和任务信心引导的适配器混合（TC-MoA）。

Result: 实验表明CKAA优于现有PEFT-based CL方法。

Conclusion: CKAA通过知识对齐和自适应聚合提升了模型对误导任务ID的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from
sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based
CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior
performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each
task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing
images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently
trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under
misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge
Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model
robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1)
Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature
distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global
classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to
distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training.
(2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference
scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant
sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in
misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA
outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

*Fuyin Ye,Erwen Yao,Jianyong Chen,Fengmei He,Junxiang Zhang,Lihao Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合张量分解和正则化的自适应网络SDTN，并进一步提出轻量级网络TRN，用于高光谱图像分类，显著提升精度并降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理高维数据、光谱-空间冗余和标记样本稀缺时表现不佳，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 结合张量分解与正则化机制的自适应网络SDTN动态调整张量秩，TRN集成SDTN提取的特征，实现多尺度光谱-空间特征捕获。

Result: 在PaviaU数据集上实验表明，相比现有方法，精度显著提升且模型参数减少。

Conclusion: SDTN和TRN框架在资源受限环境中具有实时部署潜力，适用于精准农业的高光谱图像分类。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision
agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease
detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with
high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled
samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges,
we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines
tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust
tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the
complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized
Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a
lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple
scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also
significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly
suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy
and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [108] [GLIMPSE: Do Large Vision-Language Models Truly Think With Videos or Just Glimpse at Them?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09491)
*Yiyang Zhou,Linjie Li,Shi Qiu,Zhengyuan Yang,Yuyang Zhao,Siwei Han,Yangfan He,Kangqi Li,Haonian Ji,Zihao Zhao,Haibo Tong,Lijuan Wang,Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个新的视频理解基准，旨在评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）是否能真正进行视频推理，而非仅依赖关键帧或文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试多基于静态图像，无法评估模型是否具备深层次的时间推理能力，限制了LVLMs的真实视频理解能力评估。

Method: GLIMPSE包含3,269个视频和4,342个视觉中心问题，涵盖11个类别，所有问题需观看完整视频并进行上下文推理。

Result: 人类评估准确率达94.82%，而最佳LVLM模型（GPT-o3）仅达66.43%，显示模型在视频推理上仍有显著挑战。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE揭示了LVLMs在视频理解上的局限性，强调了开发更高级时间推理模型的必要性。

Abstract: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with
question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the
video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models
can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal
reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language
models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial
frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with
videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video
understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over
4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including
Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions
are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video
and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with
video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or
relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy,
but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model,
GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move
beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.

### [109] [QuarterMap: Efficient Post-Training Token Pruning for Visual State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09514)
*Tien-Yu Chi,Hung-Yueh Chiang,Diana Marculescu,Kai-Chiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuarterMap是一种后训练激活剪枝方法，通过移除冗余空间激活并恢复维度，提升VMamba等SSM模型的吞吐量，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VMamba等基于状态空间模型（SSM）的视觉骨干网络中空间冗余问题，提升效率。

Method: 提出QuarterMap方法，通过剪枝冗余空间激活并在扫描前通过最近邻上采样恢复维度，无需重新训练。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现11%的速度提升，精度下降小于0.9%；在ADE20K和MedMamba上也表现良好。

Conclusion: QuarterMap是一种即插即用的高效部署工具，适用于SSM模型，无需牺牲迁移性。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by
leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong
SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in
its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation
pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and
restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves
throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11%
speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains
on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a
domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure,
where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across
multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe,
QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our
method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without
compromising transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可靠的测试时适应方法（ReTA），通过一致性感知熵重加权（CER）和多样性驱动的分布校准（DDC）解决现有缓存方法在分布偏移下的不可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本任务中表现优异，但在分布偏移下性能下降，现有测试时适应（TTA）方法因熵不可靠和决策边界僵化而面临挑战。

Method: ReTA结合CER（利用一致性约束加权熵）和DDC（通过多变量高斯分布建模类文本嵌入），提升缓存质量和预测准确性。

Result: 实验表明，ReTA在真实分布偏移下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTA通过双重策略有效提升了测试时适应的可靠性，为分布偏移下的视觉语言任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but
struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is
unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among
various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving
historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering
efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability
challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,
causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation
performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible
decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To
address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)
method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from
two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample
selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware
Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight
entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low
entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method
leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and
facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven
Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as
multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for
more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

*Son Nguyen,Giang Nguyen,Hung Dao,Thao Do,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDInstruct是一种多模态大语言模型（MLLM），通过内容感知的标记化策略和显式布局建模，显著提升了密集文档的关键信息提取（KIE）性能，同时减少了计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在密集文档上表现不佳，且视觉标记化方法效率低下，导致计算冗余和内存浪费。

Method: 提出VDInstruct模型，分离空间区域检测与语义特征提取，采用内容感知标记化策略，根据文档复杂度生成标记，并结合三阶段训练范式。

Result: 在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA，零样本评估中F1分数提升5.5点，图像标记数量减少约3.6倍。

Conclusion: 内容感知标记化与显式布局建模为文档理解提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual
documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content
and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on
vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant
computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce
VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic
feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization
strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates
tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure
while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm,
our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching
or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of
image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses
strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its
robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware
tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising
direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model
weights will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法在微手势在线识别任务中表现优异，成为新的最优解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team,
HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA
Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging
problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories
of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to
traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on
distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the
start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically
spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other
human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data
augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to
classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an
F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a
result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

TL;DR: DehazeSB是一种基于Schrödinger Bridge的新型无配对去雾框架，通过最优传输理论直接桥接雾图和清晰图的分布，生成高质量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN的无配对去雾方法因生成器的传输映射能力有限而效果受限，需改进。

Method: 利用最优传输理论桥接分布，引入细节保留正则化和基于CLIP的提示学习。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: DehazeSB通过优化传输映射和细节保留，显著提升了无配对去雾效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show
promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these
methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport
mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness
in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose
DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger
Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges
the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport
mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating
high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and
details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization,
which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs.
Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP
models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware
vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:

Conclusion: MENTOR在多模态图像生成中实现了高效、可控和高质量的生成，优于基于扩散的方法。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle
with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring
extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these
limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for
efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image
generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training
paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal
inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or
cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal
alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment,
followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the
integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability.
Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training
resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark,
outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt
following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction
fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to
diffusion-based methods. Dataset, code, and models are available at:

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在红外小目标检测中过于复杂且缺乏可解释性，忽视了目标的稀疏性先验。

Method: 基于RPCA模型，设计了一个动态展开网络（DRPCA-Net），通过轻量级超网络动态生成参数，并引入动态残差组（DRG）模块优化背景建模。

Result: 在多个公开红外数据集上，DRPCA-Net显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DRPCA-Net通过动态机制和稀疏先验的结合，实现了高效且鲁棒的红外小目标检测。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing,
industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent
progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to
pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the
expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These
models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small
targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance
and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of
Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network
(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware
prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods
that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a
dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables
the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the
input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse
backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to
better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more
accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.
Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that
DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
detection accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/DRPCA-Net.

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and
accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in
emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key
imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke
classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from
a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed
method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary
deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional
transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and
ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we
applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The
MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching
an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models
and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish
between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of
transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework,
particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's
decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and
establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for
early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a
trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its
integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal
stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge.
In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the
research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source
ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit
that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with
the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the
Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning
framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module
enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task
within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average
Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%. Our dataset and toolkit are available
from https://github.com/GrokCV/SeqCSIST.

Abstract: Visually-Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) has emerged as a critical field,
driven by the need to automatically process documents containing complex
visual, textual, and layout information. Recently, Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in this domain, leveraging both
Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-dependent and OCR-free frameworks to
extract and interpret information in document images. This survey reviews
recent advancements in MLLM-based VRDU, highlighting three core components: (1)
methods for encoding and fusing textual, visual, and layout features; (2)
training paradigms, including pretraining strategies, instruction-response
tuning, and the trainability of different model modules; and (3) datasets
utilized for pretraining, instruction-tuning, and supervised fine-tuning.
Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in this evolving field and
propose future directions to advance the efficiency, generalizability, and
robustness of VRDU systems.

*Bolun Zheng,Xinjie Liu,Qianyu Zhang,Canjin Wang,Fangni Chen,Mingen Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分段架构EHPE，通过局部提取指尖和手腕关节，减少误差累积，提升手部姿态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视指尖和手腕关节的重要性，且未解决远端关节误差累积问题，导致姿态估计质量下降。

Method: EHPE分为两个阶段：TW-stage提取指尖和手腕关节；PG-stage通过双分支交互网络优化其余关节位置。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试中，EHPE实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EHPE通过分段架构显著提升了手部姿态估计的精度，解决了误差累积问题。

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to
its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and
related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for
high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the
importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints
overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for
distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur
larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation
and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation
(EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the
effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the
predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key
stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions
of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint
configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a
dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the
remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available
at https://github.com/SereinNout/EHPE.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的视频推理范式ViTCoT，结合视觉和文本信息，显著提升了视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本信息进行推理，忽视了视觉模态，而人类在推理时会自然结合视觉内容。

Method: 构建了Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB)，并探索了ViTCoT范式在视频理解中的应用。

Result: ViTCoT显著优于传统文本CoT范式，并激活了更多MLLMs神经元。

Conclusion: ViTCoT为视频推理提供了一种更直观且认知对齐的方法。

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals
with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as
autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid
development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning
capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual
information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video
reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content
while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning
paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive
and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the
Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for
key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore
the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances
performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively
activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统艺术字体设计依赖手工，现有生成模型缺乏交互性，无法满足局部编辑、多字符组合等需求。

Method: WordCraft采用无训练的区域注意力机制和噪声混合技术，结合大语言模型解析用户提示。

Result: 系统能生成高质量、多样化的艺术字体，支持多语言和多字符输入，显著提升交互性。

Conclusion: WordCraft为艺术家和设计师提供了更灵活、高效的创作工具，拓展了艺术字体的可能性。

Abstract: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that
are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual
design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods,
have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions
remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative
refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation.
We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that
integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a
training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation
and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising
visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a
large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user
prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality,
stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple
languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly
enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative
possibilities for artists and designers.

Motivation: 时尚零售业务依赖产品属性的理解，而现有大语言模型在细粒度时尚属性识别中的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用DeepFashion-MultiModal数据集，以图像为唯一输入，评估GPT-4o-mini和Gemini 2.0 Flash在18类时尚属性上的表现。

Result: Gemini 2.0 Flash的宏F1得分为56.79%，优于GPT-4o-mini的43.28%。

Conclusion: Gemini 2.0 Flash在零样本任务中表现更优，但需领域微调；为时尚AI和多模态属性提取研究奠定基础。

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend
products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the
business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they
navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to
well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly
impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal
data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains
under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art
LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly
GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset
DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to
evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study
evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering
insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for
product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows
that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a
macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a
macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide
practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product
attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific
fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research
in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM2在手术视频中因快速器械移动、频繁遮挡和复杂交互导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 引入上下文感知和遮挡弹性记忆模型，采用多目标、单循环、单提示推理。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别比SAM2提升4.36%和6.1%。

Conclusion: MA-SAM2在无需额外参数或训练的情况下，显著提升了手术视频分割的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery,
essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable
advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent
limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the
unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent
occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished
performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these
challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video
object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and
occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against
occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while
maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a
multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency
of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any
additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved
performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and
EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical
surgical applications.

TL;DR: Hyma提出了一种基于超网络的多模态模型对齐方法，显著降低了最优单模态模型选择和连接器训练的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态基础模型通常通过拼接多个预训练单模态模型实现，但选择和训练连接器模块的计算成本高昂。

Method: 利用超网络的参数预测能力，为N×M种单模态模型组合联合训练连接器模块。

Result: 实验表明，Hyma将最优单模态模型对的搜索成本降低10倍，同时性能与网格搜索相当。

Conclusion: Hyma是一种高效的多模态模型对齐解决方案，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a
connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or
representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the
complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets
coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal
models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module
training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied
critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel
all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector
training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the
parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained
connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our
experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by
$10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and
trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of
diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it
remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis,
salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine
learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal
images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and
explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including
color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge
detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction
using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature
set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural
network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy
while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.
Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed
model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This
work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource
agricultural settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前密集令牌方法精度高但速度慢，SAM模型速度快但精度不足，Inter2Former旨在解决这一权衡问题。

Method: 提出动态提示嵌入（DPE）、动态混合注意力（DHA）、混合专家（HMoE）和动态局部上采样（DLU）四种改进。

Result: 在高精度交互式分割基准测试中，Inter2Former实现了SOTA性能，同时在CPU设备上保持高效。

Conclusion: Inter2Former通过计算优化，成功平衡了交互式分割的精度与效率，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting
target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world
scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods
achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively
slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances
the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises
segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this
challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which
introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding
(DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding
additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid
Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens
through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed
efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop
Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation
strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we
present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which
localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling
only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks
demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on
CPU devices.

Conclusion: 研究展示了改进的点跟踪方法在超声心动图中的潜力，尤其是在提升测量精度和泛化能力方面。

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in
echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While
traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate
cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored
in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.
Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general
videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain
limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode
ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different
views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we
refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations
to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through
impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging
multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced
spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their
baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker
boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error
by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking
models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking
accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to
echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods
improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated,
semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无监督适应中无法捕捉细粒度类别差异或计算成本高，FAIR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出FAIR方法，通过Class Description Anchors动态对齐特征，并使用Learned Alignment Score改进伪标签生成。

Result: 在13个细粒度数据集上，FAIR比现有方法平均提升2.78%。

Conclusion: FAIR通过动态对齐和交互优化，显著提升了细粒度无监督适应的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by
aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining.
Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained
classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot
capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive
pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that
modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more
accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves
performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained
Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that
dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language
embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the
definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an
adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve
self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a
self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the
presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial
performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable
overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

TL;DR: ECP是一个无需训练、任务无关的两阶段框架，旨在提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在高分辨率图像上的性能，通过提取候选区域并预测最终输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在高分辨率图像上的细粒度定位和推理能力不足，原因是训练和测试分辨率不一致。

Method: 提出ECP框架，先通过低分辨率预测提取候选区域，再基于候选区域进行最终预测。

Result: 在4K GUI grounding和4K、8K MLLM感知任务上，分别实现了21.3%、5.8%、5.2%的绝对性能提升。

Conclusion: ECP有效解决了MLLMs在高分辨率图像上的性能问题，同时保留了细粒度视觉细节。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.
However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and
reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that
MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained
image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images
directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution
discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring
consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then
Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework
designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key
intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,
their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization
cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and
then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively
preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by
high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K
MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared
to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at

TL;DR: GAA是一个基于预训练潜在扩散模型的少样本异常图像-掩膜对生成框架，通过区域引导和语义对齐生成高质量异常样本，解决了现有方法在真实感、掩膜对齐和泛化能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中异常样本稀缺限制了异常检测方法的性能，现有异常合成方法存在真实感低、掩膜对齐不准确和泛化能力差的问题。

Result: 在MVTec AD和LOCO数据集上的实验表明，GAA在异常合成质量和下游任务（如定位和分类）中表现优异。

Conclusion: GAA通过少样本生成高质量异常样本，显著提升了异常检测任务的性能。

Abstract: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the
scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing
methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly
synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often
struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a
region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA
leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate
realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small
number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition
to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies,
enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then
utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained
semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of
anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy
ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks,
while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve
the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance
in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假肢步态分析对优化假肢设计和改善患者生活质量至关重要，但现有视觉方法在检测和分析假肢时面临挑战。

Method: 提出ProGait数据集，包含412个视频片段，涵盖假肢的轮廓、姿态和步态模式，并提供了基准任务和微调基线模型。

Result: 基线模型在假肢特定任务中表现出更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing
individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and
improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing
prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life
quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine
learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait
analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis,
due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait,
to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human
Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from
four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs
through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait
patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the
dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models
to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset.
We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models,
demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for
prosthesis-specific tasks. Our code is available at

*Tom Kouwenhoven,Kiana Shahrasbi,Tessa Verhoef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究重新评估了两种CLIP变体（ResNet和ViT）是否表现出bouba-kiki效应，发现模型表现不一致且与人类认知差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉-语言模型（VLMs）是否以类似人类认知的方式整合跨模态信息，特别是bouba-kiki效应。

Method: 使用基于提示的概率评估和Grad-CAM视觉注意力分析，对比人类实验数据。

Result: 模型未一致表现bouba-kiki效应，ResNet偏好圆形但整体表现与人类认知不符。

Conclusion: VLMs在跨模态概念理解上存在局限性，与人类直觉不一致。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether
vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways
that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the
bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba"
with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found
in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive
re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer
(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two
complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based
evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as
a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our
findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki
effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance
across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison
with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall
markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of
human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the
extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting
limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human
intuitions.

TL;DR: 研究评估了AI模型在糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）预测中的公平性和性能，探讨了解缠技术对减少偏见的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是导致工作年龄成年人视力丧失的主要原因，传统筛查方法成本高且难以普及，AI算法提供了可扩展的解决方案，但公平性和泛化性仍是问题。

Method: 使用mBRSET眼底数据集，训练了ConvNeXt V2、DINOv2和Swin V2三种模型，预测DR及敏感属性（如年龄和性别），并评估公平性和解缠技术效果。

Result: 所有模型在DR预测中表现优异（最高94% AUROC），但公平性评估显示存在差异（如DINOv2中年龄组间10% AUROC差距）。解缠技术对不同模型效果不一。

Conclusion: 研究强调了医学影像AI中公平性的重要性，解缠技术效果因模型而异，需进一步优化以实现公平可靠的医疗解决方案。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is
often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present
a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and
generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of
image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement
as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three
models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to
predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness
was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to
reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing
(up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77%
AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10%
AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction
had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved
DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2
and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity
of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the
importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable
healthcare solutions.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在通用数据集上训练，缺乏对领域特定视觉线索（如面部图像）的推理能力，尤其是面部结构、表情、情感等细节理解任务。

Method: 提出弱监督流程，利用ChatGPT生成基于FairFace数据集的问答对（FairFaceGPT），训练FaceLLM模型。

Result: FaceLLM在多种面部中心任务中表现优异，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: FaceLLM展示了语言模型合成监督在构建领域专用MLLMs中的潜力，为可信赖、以人为本的多模态AI系统树立了先例。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic
datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such
as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed
understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic
features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated
face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal
large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To
construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that
uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality
question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting
corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including
expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments
demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various
face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work
highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for
building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,
human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM
models are publicly available in the project page.

Abstract: Handwritten character recognition is getting popular among researchers
because of its possible applications in facilitating technological search
engines, social media, recommender systems, etc. The Devanagari script is one
of the oldest language scripts in India that does not have proper digitization
tools. With the advancement of computing and technology, the task of this
research is to extract handwritten Hindi characters from an image of Devanagari
script with an automated approach to save time and obsolete data. In this
paper, we present a technique to recognize handwritten Devanagari characters
using two deep convolutional neural network layers. This work employs a
methodology that is useful to enhance the recognition rate and configures a
convolutional neural network for effective Devanagari handwritten text
recognition (DHTR). This approach uses the Devanagari handwritten character
dataset (DHCD), an open dataset with 36 classes of Devanagari characters. Each
of these classes has 1700 images for training and testing purposes. This
approach obtains promising results in terms of accuracy by achieving 96.36%
accuracy in testing and 99.55% in training time.

Motivation: 现有眼部分割方法在运动模糊、眼睑遮挡和训练-测试域差异等挑战下表现不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Result: 在MIoU、E1、F1和ACC等指标上优于现有方法，尤其在运动模糊、眼睑遮挡和跨域挑战下表现突出。

Conclusion: EyeSeg通过不确定性建模显著提升了眼部分割的鲁棒性和准确性，适用于AR/VR中的眼部分割任务。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze
estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth
user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework
designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with:
motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations,
existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal
performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by
uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation
framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing
Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior.
Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates
segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in
downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score
and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for
robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid
occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that
EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing
previous approaches. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 珊瑚礁是重要但脆弱的生态系统，需要持续监测以支持保护。现有珊瑚图像解读依赖专业知识，而视觉问答（VQA）技术有望提供用户友好的交互方式。

Method: 开发了半自动数据构建流程，结合海洋生物学家确保数据质量和可扩展性，构建了包含多维问题的CoralVQA数据集。

Result: 评估多个先进的大视觉语言模型（LVLM），揭示了关键局限和机遇，为未来模型开发提供基础。

Conclusion: CoralVQA为珊瑚礁图像中的视觉语言推理提供了全面基准，支持珊瑚保护工作。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous
monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential
information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging
due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered
by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly
interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery
demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific
annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce
CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It
contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3
oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess
ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop
a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine
biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.
CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for
studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By
evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and
opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,
with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

TL;DR: 论文提出CrisisLandMark数据集和CLOSP框架，通过文本对齐光学与SAR图像，提升检索性能54%，并整合地理坐标优化任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-图像检索系统多限于RGB数据，未能充分利用多传感器（如SAR和多光谱）的物理信息。

Method: 构建CrisisLandMark数据集，提出CLOSP框架，通过对比学习对齐光学与SAR图像嵌入空间，并引入GeoCLOSP整合地理坐标。

Result: CLOSP提升检索性能54%，GeoCLOSP在特定地理任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 多传感器数据与地理背景的整合对遥感档案的潜力释放至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for
applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However,
most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to
exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the
all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the
spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1
SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual
annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from
authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific
sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),
a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR
images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves
a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.
Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent
difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge
from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which
integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful
trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general
semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving
location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work
highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context
is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.

Conclusion: VST-Pose为室内连续运动分析提供了可靠且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation has emerged as a promising non-visual
alternative approaches due to its pene-trability and privacy advantages. This
paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and
continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed
method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with
dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately
capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships among body joints.
To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is
integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement
patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D
pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and
demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric,
outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset.
Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness
and effectiveness in 3D pose estimation tasks. The proposed system provides a
reliable and privacy-aware solution for continuous human motion analysis in
indoor environments. Our codes are available in

Conclusion: 该研究填补了视网膜异常检测领域的空白，为未来方法评估和进步提供了可靠基准。

Abstract: Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and
systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been
hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,
which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.
Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal
images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of
anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of
generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.
Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly
focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),
overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that
are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and
systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and
benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach
leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the
best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when
encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms
in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with
a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a
new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在被动任务中表现优秀，但在具身环境中的在线交互和主动场景理解能力有限，需要新的数据集和方法来提升。

Method: 提出EmRACE-3K数据集，包含3,000多个语言指导任务，涵盖导航、物体操作和多阶段目标执行，并使用监督学习和强化学习微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: 零样本设置下模型成功率低于20%，微调后性能显著提升，验证了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: EmRACE-3K为具身推理能力提供了重要基准，微调方法展示了改进模型的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures,
delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating
content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on
subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such
commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic
commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While
recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising
capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate
fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We
construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment
commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries
across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare
and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with
potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and
safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary
generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively
access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments
show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which
highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar
holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment
instruction.

Motivation: 多视角视觉任务中相机几何关系对3D感知至关重要，但现有方法未能充分利用这些关系。

Method: 比较了三种相机几何编码方法：token级光线图编码、attention级相对位姿编码，以及新提出的PRoPE（投影位置编码）。

Result: 实验表明，PRoPE在多种任务（如新视角合成、立体深度估计）中表现优越，尤其在泛化性和模型规模扩展时效果显著。

Conclusion: PRoPE能有效捕捉相机几何信息，提升多视角视觉任务的性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks,
where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D
perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use
camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare
techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap
encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding
we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete
camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional
encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning
improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains
from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying
intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for
generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera
intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks,
stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger
model sizes.

Conclusion: 研究为未来紧凑Transformer网络的令牌优化技术提供了方向。

Abstract: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for
accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length,
these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers
to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.
First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and
compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,
pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.
plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,
ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain
effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are
increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these
gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token
compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard
and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token
compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often
underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only
provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on
adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks
for edge AI and AI agent applications.

Abstract: Camera traps are revolutionising wildlife monitoring by capturing vast
amounts of visual data; however, the manual identification of individual
animals remains a significant bottleneck. This study introduces a fully
self-supervised approach to learning robust chimpanzee face embeddings from
unlabeled camera-trap footage. Leveraging the DINOv2 framework, we train Vision
Transformers on automatically mined face crops, eliminating the need for
identity labels. Our method demonstrates strong open-set re-identification
performance, surpassing supervised baselines on challenging benchmarks such as
Bossou, despite utilising no labelled data during training. This work
underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity
monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变分分数蒸馏（VSD）方法在实践中存在收敛慢和不稳定的问题，论文旨在通过优化分数模型与3D模型的交互来提升生成质量。

Method: 提出线性化前瞻变分分数蒸馏（$L^2$-VSD），通过调整优化顺序和使用线性化模型，提高分数蒸馏的稳定性和效率。

Result: 实验证明$L^2$-VSD在生成质量和稳定性上优于现有方法，并能无缝集成到其他VSD框架中。

Conclusion: $L^2$-VSD通过前瞻和线性化优化，显著提升了文本到3D生成的效率和效果。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion
models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation
(VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can
be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the
distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation
gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to
suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform
an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model
and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA
and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their
optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score
model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable
corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable
training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we
propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving
rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).
$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff
functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments
validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior
score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be
seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的混合（几何和图像）方法，用于计算碎片对的最佳对齐，无需假设其形状、尺寸或图像内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理现实拼图中碎片的几何特性，且通常依赖于碎片的限制形状。

Method: 采用混合几何和图像的方法，引入新的图像碎片数据集和侵蚀模型，并嵌入考古拼图解决框架。

Result: 在RePAIR 2D数据集上实现了最先进的邻域级精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 提出的兼容性方法显著提升了性能，适用于现实拼图问题。

Abstract: Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most
fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve
different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches
fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric
properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases,
compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments.
In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial)
approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without
any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We
introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image
fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological
erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then
embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving
framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and
recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance
improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NegRefine提出了一种改进的负标签细化框架，用于零样本OOD检测，通过过滤子类别标签和专有名词，并引入多匹配感知评分函数，提高了检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于负标签的方法（如NegLabel和CSP）在区分OOD样本时存在误判问题，尤其是当负标签是分布内标签的子类别或专有名词时。此外，这些方法难以处理匹配多个标签的图像。

Method: NegRefine通过过滤机制排除负标签集中的子类别标签和专有名词，并采用多匹配感知评分函数动态调整多个标签对图像的贡献。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等大规模基准测试中，NegRefine表现优于现有方法，显著减少了误判。

Conclusion: NegRefine通过改进负标签选择和评分机制，显著提升了零样本OOD检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled
zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information.
Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown
promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for
distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting
in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of
in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling
images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose
NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD
detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels
and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a
multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the
contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more
robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate
NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中弱势道路使用者（如行人、骑行者）安全问题，现有模型缺乏标准化评估基准。

Method: 构建包含1K事故视频、6K多选问答对和1K密集场景描述的VRU-Accident基准，评估17种先进模型。

Result: 模型在视觉属性上表现良好，但在事故原因、类型和可预防性推理方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: VRU-Accident为评估模型在安全关键场景中的能力提供了标准化工具，揭示了现有模型的不足。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes
involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene
understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no
standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in
complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we
present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to
evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident
comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K
multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories
(with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K
dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly
on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture
both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the
current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17
state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense
captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well
on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning
and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

Motivation: 研究深度学习模型是否形成与人类相似的3D形状表征，以理解模型的局限性。

Method: 通过两个人类实验（点密度、物体方向和局部几何结构）比较卷积神经网络和视觉变换器模型的表现。

Result: 视觉变换器模型（point transformer）比卷积模型（DGCNN）更接近人类表现，因其支持3D形状的层次抽象。

Conclusion: 视觉变换器模型在3D形状表征上更接近人类，表明其机制更适合处理全局形状信息。

Abstract: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes
depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly
sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep
learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D
shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape
representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition.
We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form
representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their
representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two
human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object
orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).
Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We
compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural
network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with
human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better
account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage
mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports
hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

dataset, the first large-scale, high-quality dataset designed for audio-visual
dyadic interactive virtual human generation. Totaling over 8,743 hours,
SpeakerVid-5M contains more than 5.2 million video clips of human portraits. It
covers diverse scales and interaction types, including monadic talking,
listening, and dyadic conversations. Crucially, the dataset is structured along
two key dimensions: interaction type and data quality. First, it is categorized
into four types (dialogue branch, single branch, listening branch and
multi-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified
into a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of
2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based
video chat baseline trained on this data, accompanied by a dedicated set of
metrics and test data to serve as a benchmark VidChatBench for future work.
Both the dataset and the corresponding data processing code will be publicly
released. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/SpeakerVid-5M/

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly
critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human
part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets
and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their
applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework
that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time
and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support
to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based
video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal
correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel
Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and
mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating
memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding
fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of
the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3%
acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was
limited to parsing fixed classes.

Motivation: 现有反事实视觉解释方法忽视因果关系和虚假相关性，导致解释质量受限。

Method: 提出CECAS框架，结合因果视角生成反事实解释，避免虚假因素的干扰。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，实现有效性、稀疏性、接近性和真实性的平衡。

Conclusion: CECAS通过因果引导显著提升了反事实解释的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making
artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual
perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the
causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation
process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual
images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a
causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It
innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on
spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple
benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various
aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

Result: MCGA在实验中表现优异，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: MCGA通过结合先验知识和注意力机制，高效且轻量地实现了高质量的HSI重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective
solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing
learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the
RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent
challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional
information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,
which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the
first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI
datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the
RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace
latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a
direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction
quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,
which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral
reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism
ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an
entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at

Conclusion: 严格旋转等变对航空目标检测性能有显著提升，多分支头设计有效优化了模型效率。

Abstract: Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation
equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However,
recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.
Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn
approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed
rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation
equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve
approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation
equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open
question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone
and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with
approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the
impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.
Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant
features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter
count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned
improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant
single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an
exceptionally low parameter count.

Conclusion: IGD为自动化图形设计提供了可扩展且实用的新范式。

Abstract: Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and
combining text, images and graphics. Two-stage methods that rely primarily on
layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still
labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic
design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering,
which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic
design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to
swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural
language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric
rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and
establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying
the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal
understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute
prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model
to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD
architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic
design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a
new solution for graphic design.

Conclusion: Crucial-Diff能高效生成多样且高质量的样本，显著提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and
autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus
hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies
employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate
data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic
and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's
weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for
different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these
issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to
synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene
Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to
capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates
hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream
model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our
Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving
a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset,
Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be
released after acceptance.

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了4D-STEM的能力，为辐射敏感材料的结构分析提供了一种通用且高效的新方法。

Abstract: While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into
structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on
beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this
challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron
microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that
have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple
low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,
multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network
for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose
data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,
semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic
evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial
resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our
work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable
method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

Method: KPHD-Net利用变分Dirichlet分布表示类别概率分布，结合Hölder散度和Dempster-Shafer证据理论，并通过Kalman滤波器增强融合结果的可靠性。

Conclusion: KPHD-Net通过改进的不确定性估计和多视图融合方法，显著提升了多视图学习的性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve
task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views.
However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions
is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current
methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty
of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To
address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H\"older divergence, is proposed for
multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs
a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability
distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it
with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation
effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H\"older divergence
offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring
enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is
introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state
estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final
fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and
clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with
theoretical guarantees.

Motivation: 尽管潜在扩散模型在图像生成方面具有巨大潜力，但自编码器的理想属性和最优设计尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过分析自编码器的三个关键属性（潜在平滑性、感知压缩质量和重建质量），提出了一种基于掩码自编码器的新型自编码器VMAE，并将其整合到LDM框架中，形成LDMAE。

Result: 实验表明，LDMAE显著提升了图像生成质量和计算效率。

Conclusion: VMAE和LDMAE为潜在扩散模型中的自编码器设计提供了新的方向，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in
image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders
have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in
LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual
compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing
autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose
Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical
features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM
framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders
(LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly
enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 3DGAA是一种实用的对抗攻击框架，可用于评估自动驾驶感知系统的安全性。

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous
driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world
environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize
texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.
In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel
adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional
parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry
and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on
patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,
scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce
physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce
a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical
augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing
attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both
virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.
Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from
87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.
Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical
conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable
adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack
framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural
information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision
transformer-based deep learning framework.
  Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin
Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data
for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics
from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable
transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the
transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank
Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction
(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)
and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the
scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of
95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with
Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it
reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild
cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from
amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying
amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based
explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including
the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model
predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and
transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and
amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited
biomedical settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of UAV technology and its extensive application in
various fields such as military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and
logistics, achieving efficient and accurate Anti-UAV tracking has become
essential. The importance of Anti-UAV tracking is increasingly prominent,
especially in scenarios such as public safety, border patrol, search and

and current challenges of Anti-UAV detection and tracking technologies. Next,
it investigates and compiles several publicly available datasets, providing
accessible links to support researchers in efficiently addressing related
challenges. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the major vision-based and
vision-fusion-based Anti-UAV detection and tracking algorithms proposed in

research directions, aiming to provide valuable insights for advancing the
field.

### [166] [Binomial Self-Compensation: Mechanism and Suppression of Motion Error in Phase-Shifting Profilometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10009)
*Geyou Zhang,Kai Liu,Ce Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种图像序列二项式自补偿（I-BSC）方法，通过加权求和同质条纹图像而非相位帧，显著降低动态测量中的运动误差，同时减少计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决相位移动轮廓测量（PSP）在动态测量中因物体运动导致的误差问题。

Method: I-BSC方法对同质条纹图像进行加权求和，仅需计算一次反正切函数，降低了计算复杂度和误差累积。

Result: I-BSC在减少运动误差的同时实现了准单帧速率，计算帧速率提升数倍至数十倍，且运动误差收敛更快。

Conclusion: I-BSC是一种高效的方法，适用于高精度动态3D扫描，具有高像素-深度-时间分辨率。

Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D
scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling.
However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static
does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion.
To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial
self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames
weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the
motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its
efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation
due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.
Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation
(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase
frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image
sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both
limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show
that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error
while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate
equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high
pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the
computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the
computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster
motion error convergence.

Result: 在显著降低内存消耗的同时，实现了竞争性性能，支持高质量设备端个性化。

Conclusion: 该方法为内存高效的模型个性化提供了有效解决方案，适用于资源受限的设备。

Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image
diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited
computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective
optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on
low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution
images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As
observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to
target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to
resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with
minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior
adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for
effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural
consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To
maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware
probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization
strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting
from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while
ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,
high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

for this unique medium and curate a new 20,800-page annotated dataset. CoSMo,
developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms
traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language
models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our
findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS
macro-structure, yet demonstrate multimodal benefits in resolving challenging
ambiguities. CoSMo establishes a new state-of-the-art, paving the way for
scalable comic book analysis.

Conclusion: MoVieS通过统一建模动态场景的多方面特性，实现了高效、多功能的动态新视角合成，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic
novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D
scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising
their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified
modeling of appearance, geometry and motion, and enables view synthesis,
reconstruction and 3D point tracking within a single learning-based framework.
By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS
enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on
task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range
of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object
segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency
of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while
offering several orders of magnitude speedups.

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成能力上表现优异，但受曝光偏差影响较大。本文通过观察噪声图像能量的变化规律，试图解决这一问题。

Method: 利用小波变换分别调节低频和高频子带，并基于能量变化分析曝光偏差。方法无需训练，即插即用。

Result: 显著提升了多种扩散模型的生成质量，并提供了跨模型架构的曝光偏差解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的频率域调节机制有效解决了扩散模型的曝光偏差问题，且具有通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are
significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key
observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the
diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The
reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and
high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude
variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean
data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation
mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and
high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more
accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is
training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality
of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias
across different model architectures. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 策略有效解决了领域差异导致的性能下降，为数据稀缺场景提供了技术范例。

Abstract: To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in
remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates
a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The
approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse
source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on
its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target
domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by
highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results
demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body
segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only
effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain
discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for
high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and
environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a
zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder,
CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To
remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1)
A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked
and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while
preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with
unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction.
(3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers
to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M
images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for
training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For
downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers
promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with

Conclusion: 该框架在多摄像头多目标跟踪中表现高效且准确。

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera multi-target (MCMT) tracking framework that ensures
consistent global identity assignment across views using trajectory and
appearance cues. The pipeline starts with BoT-SORT-based single-camera
tracking, followed by an initial glance phase to initialize global IDs via
trajectory-feature matching. In later frames, new tracklets are matched to
existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New
global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or

Motivation: 像素级标注成本高昂且耗时，半监督分割方法通过利用少量标注图像和大量未标注图像学习模型，但基础模型的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 提出DEARLi方法，结合无监督掩码变换器一致性和CLIP特征的零样本分类增强识别，通过SAM伪标签的类无关解码器预热增强定位。

Result: 在ADE20K数据集上仅用158张标注图像，实现了29.9 PQ和38.9 mIoU，性能显著优于现有半监督语义分割方法，且GPU内存需求降低8倍。

Conclusion: DEARLi在标签稀缺和大分类场景下表现优异，为半监督分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised
segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled
images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models
could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their
exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel
semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We
enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency
with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by
class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting
decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly
excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies
and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in
semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less
GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We
observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The

Conclusion: 反馈机制增强了模型的鲁棒性和数据效率，为更适应性和生物启发的神经网络架构提供了方向。

Abstract: While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to
iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely
feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose
a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent
loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over
time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and
introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and
exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled
experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model
significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and
generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback
achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the
feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that
feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more
adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于文本的人物检索方法，通过图像和区域级别的域适应技术，解决了合成数据与真实数据之间的域差距问题，并在多个数据集上取得了最优效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题和手动标注成本高，合成数据被广泛用于预训练模型，但合成数据与真实数据之间的域差距（如光照、颜色和视角差异）限制了模型效果。

Method: 提出了一种统一的文本人物检索流程，包含两个主要组件：图像级适应的Domain-aware Diffusion（DaD）和区域级适应的Multi-granularity Relation Alignment（MRA）。

Result: 在CUHK-PEDES、ICFG-PEDES和RSTPReid数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过双级别域适应方法，有效缩小了合成与真实数据之间的差距，提升了检索效果。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify
individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues
and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become
a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements.
However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and
real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color,
and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of
the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified
text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both
image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,
i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and
Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the
name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images
from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,
e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level
alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their
descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.
Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved
state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,
outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非对称表示学习（ARL）策略，通过不平衡优化解决多模态学习中的欠优化问题，证明模态依赖比例与模态方差比例成反比时性能最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习常因欠优化问题表现不如单模态学习，现有方法通过梯度平衡解决，但本文认为不平衡学习才是最优设置。

Method: 提出ARL策略，通过辅助正则器计算模态预测方差，并基于方差比例重新加权优化，同时引入预测偏差联合优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了ARL的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: ARL无需额外参数，独立于多模态模型结构，能显著提升多模态学习性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may
perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue
to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through
gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not
the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we
prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of
their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the
Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning
via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each
modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates
coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each
modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to
the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,
ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly
optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share
parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality
representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters
and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal
model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the
effectiveness and versatility of ARL. Code is available at

Result: 研究发现种族背景对情绪表达有显著影响，表明情绪普遍性假设存在过度概括。

Conclusion: 结论指出，情绪表达分析应考虑种族差异，提出的种族感知框架在微表情识别中表现更优。

Abstract: How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional
expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human
psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial
hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and
interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression
analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion
universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and
social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of
ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the
emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective
of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate
the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.
We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically
annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically
annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and
stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain
influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we
propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature
learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises
ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved
understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary
investigation into this new realm of research. Code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，模态编码器和融合模块的优化冲突导致性能不如单模态学习，现有方法未能解决这一问题。

Method: DGL通过截断多模态损失的梯度并替换为单模态损失的梯度，消除梯度干扰。

Result: 实验证明DGL在多种模态、任务和框架中有效且通用。

Conclusion: DGL成功解决了多模态学习中的优化冲突问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have
worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this
problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them
through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant
modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In
this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the
cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to
each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the
performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the
unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)
framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality
fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient
back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces
it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient
back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This
helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.
Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and
frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of the proposed DGL. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA的新方法，通过部分级可控模型实现个性化人体图像生成，避免了推理时的计算负担，同时提高了生成图像的保真度和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化人体图像生成面临精确和一致属性保存的挑战，现有方法计算成本高且不适用于实时应用。

Method: 训练仅LoRA层，利用空间参考减少信息丢失，并引入选择性主题区域损失以优化生成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保真度和一致性上显著优于现有技术，实现了真实且身份保持的全身合成。

Conclusion: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA无需推理时额外参数，仅需少量训练样本即可高效生成高质量图像。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific
subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images.
However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the
need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity,
clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often
require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new
subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches
are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel
part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By
training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at
inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key
idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage
spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and
consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which
encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our
loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while
maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no
additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a
single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and
benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing
techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and
identity-preserving full-body synthesis.

Result: VRFNO在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，显著优于Reflow。

Conclusion: VRFNO通过创新设计有效解决了Reflow的局限性，成为单步/少步生成的新标杆。

Abstract: The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the
rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between
noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in
single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations
in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images
due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic
couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel
alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization
(VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a
neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical
velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more
accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise
optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real
images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors
caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and
real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates
the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both
one-step and few-step generation tasks.

Motivation: 解决现有预训练视觉语言模型在处理接近InD数据的OOD样本时易误分类的问题。

Method: 利用扩散模型和多模态大语言模型生成合成OOD数据，通过迭代修复和噪声调整优化样本，微调CLIP模型。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，AUROC提升2.80%，FPR95降低11.13%。

Conclusion: SynOOD通过合成边界对齐的OOD样本，显著提升了OOD检测性能，且计算开销低。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD
samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,
can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like
diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a
potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel
approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging
OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level
discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative
in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,
boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise
adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,
effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully
synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label
features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between
near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,
with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly
surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by
11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented
creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining
social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these
concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes
increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the
quality of AI-generated images has reached a level that can easily deceive even
the most discerning observers. Our systematic evaluation highlights a critical
weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform
exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle
significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM,
a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media
platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID
performance in real-world scenarios: backbone architecture, training data
composition, pre-processing strategies and data augmentation combinations. By
systematically analyzing these components, we shed light on their impact on
detection efficacy. Our modifications result in an average AUC improvement of
26.87% across various AID models under real-world conditions.

Conclusion: 风格迁移是一种通用方法，可有效减少纹理偏差并增强语义分割模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural
networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization
capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular
DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image
classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an
effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can
likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we
perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those
random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting
style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with
the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing
their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that
in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and
strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well
as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural
networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on
PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

Result: 实验表明，优化的对抗性背景能有效攻击多种相机位姿估计模型。

Conclusion: KBA方法通过对称背景和优化损失显著提升了攻击效果。

Abstract: Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is
essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo
reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the
accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background
textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints.
In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which
uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These
discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective
attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments.
Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize
the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack
effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial
kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation
models.

Conclusion: FTCFormer通过语义驱动的标记生成，显著提升了图像分类性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success
across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range
self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer
architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting
the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal
feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token
Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based
downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic
meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less
informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,
regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance
feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak
Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center
determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a
channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments
on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer
on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer
baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,
1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%
on four remote sensing datasets. The code is available at:

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，IP-FVR在质量和身份保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IP-FVR在面部视频恢复中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from
degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,
identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing
average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these
challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality
reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during
the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity
information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention
mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip
identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback
learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with
suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift
within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an
exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by
iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.
This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.
Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative
prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and
minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR
outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,
showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video
restoration.

Result: 实验表明，DisCo在多个视频理解基准上显著优于现有方法，并提高了标记效率。

Conclusion: DisCo为视频MLLM提供了一种高效且性能优越的视觉封装解决方案。

Abstract: In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual
encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into
representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely
employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal
incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers
shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains
unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,
a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and
temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key
components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique
semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative
concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring
consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video
frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we
demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher
token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness. The code:

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into
spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an
intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail
to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose
a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging
contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach
employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned
with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive
objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and
input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our
dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants
and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

Method: IMD框架包括两部分：1）使用生成式扩散模型捕捉实例级细节；2）提出跨图像交互提示模块，促进图像对之间的双向信息交互。

Result: IMD在常用基准测试中达到新SOTA，在多实例基准IMIM上提升了12%。

Conclusion: IMD通过解决不对齐问题，显著提升了特征匹配性能，尤其是在多实例场景中。

Abstract: Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm
that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous
works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into
feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the
foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image
understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings
derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the
optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective
mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image
understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle
when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we
introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching
with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant
solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize
global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to
effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism
in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image
interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information
interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,
we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance
scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly
evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our
method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

Conclusion: QLIP通过结合文本提示优化量化过程，为高效扩散模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as
text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits
their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network
quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient
diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not
consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of
information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text
Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit
precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be
seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance
quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the
quality of the generated images across various datasets.

Motivation: 改进平面图中墙壁分割的泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，注入特征的使用相比普通U-Net提高了性能。

Conclusion: FGSSNet通过特征引导有效提升了墙壁分割的准确性。

Abstract: We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic
segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability
of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation
backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract
domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net
to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained
as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls
present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation
of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so,
we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall
patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments
show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison
to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 现有确定性文本适配器无法充分捕捉类别描述的多样性和类间关系，限制了视觉语言模型（VLM）在下游任务中的潜力。

Method: 利用顶点随机知识图（VRKG）建模类别多样性和类间关系，通过概率消息传播学习上下文感知分布表示，并采用重参数化采样实现适配器学习。结合UMF动态集成多个预训练模型。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了VRGAdapter的有效性。

Conclusion: VRGAdapter提供了一种更通用的适配器解决方案，显著提升了视觉语言模型在下游任务中的性能。

Abstract: Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in
transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual
feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to
inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists
significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such
description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can
benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic
adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,
it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To
address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter
and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first
models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class
relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex
Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message
propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each
class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve
textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter
solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In
addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also
introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that
dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的细粒度目标检测场景（如鸟类、鱼类、花卉分类）需要区分视觉差异极小的类别，而现有零样本目标检测方法主要针对粗粒度任务，难以胜任。

Method: 提出MSHC方法，基于改进的两阶段检测器，采用多级语义感知嵌入对齐损失，确保视觉与语义空间的紧密耦合。

Result: 在构建的FGZSD-Birds数据集上，MSHC方法优于现有零样本目标检测模型。

Conclusion: FG-ZSD是一个重要且具有挑战性的新问题，MSHC方法为解决该问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to
localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD
works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are
visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in
real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where
the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting
different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.
  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained
Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of
different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We
develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on
an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware
embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and
semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for
the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds,
which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera
and 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method
outperforms existing ZSD models.

Result: 实验显示FOCAL提升了CLIP和SAM在2D/3D旋转、光照变化和昼夜变化等挑战性变换中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FOCAL挑战了变换特定训练的必要性，提供了一种可扩展的鲁棒性实现路径。

Abstract: Real-world visual perception requires invariance to diverse transformations,
yet current methods rely heavily on specialized architectures or training on
predefined augmentations, limiting generalization. We propose FOCAL, a
test-time, data-driven framework that achieves robust perception by leveraging
internet-scale visual priors from foundation models. By generating and
optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical"
views, FOCAL enhances robustness without re-training or architectural changes.
Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across
challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts
(contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential
applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that
transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to
invariance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sutkarsh/focal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络（CNNs）在图像分类中偏向于纹理特征，而TDA能捕捉几何信息，弥补这一不足。

Method: 设计了一个TDA特征工程流程，并将其与ResNet18结合，用于遥感图像分类。

Result: 在EuroSAT数据集上达到99.33%准确率，提升1.44%；在RESISC45数据集上比基线高1.82%。

Conclusion: TDA特征能与深度学习结合，扩展了TDA的适用性，即使在没有明显拓扑结构的数据集上。

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining
rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe
complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA
typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract
discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local
features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering
pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep
learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the
performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving
99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model
accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x
larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our
method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45
dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in
satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA
features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without
explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A
clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon
publication.

Conclusion: SC-AGIQA通过语义约束和频域分析，显著提升了AI生成图像的质量评估效果。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI)
technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly
vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like
CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when
applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic
misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we
propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment
(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints
to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image
consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach
integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned
challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic
Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and
comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and
the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which
draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing
frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to
better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of
fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏语义关键点，获取成本高且不可靠，因此提出无需关键点注释的解决方案。

Conclusion: 4D-Animal具有大规模应用潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos
typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However,
obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on
limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose
4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from
videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a
dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters,
enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process.
Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates
silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D
visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions
across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms
both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets
generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential
for large-scale applications. The code is released at

Result: 实验表明，RefSTAR在身份保持和参考特征转移质量上表现优异。

Conclusion: RefSTAR通过有效整合参考图像特征，显著提升了盲人脸图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex
degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods
introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality
reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,
mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this
paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from
high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image
restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and
reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference
selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a
RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating
masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the
trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion
paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.
Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further
ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle
consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive
experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,
showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer
quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at

Conclusion: GT-Loc通过联合优化时间与地理定位，实现了高效的时间预测和地理定位，并支持组合和基于文本的图像检索。

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only
visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction,
retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely
on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes
and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly
depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to
geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel
retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)
and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate
encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a
shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,
instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,
we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by
modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present
new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous
time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an
input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results
on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates
compositional and text-based image retrieval.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and
precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these
state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large
number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting,
particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor
generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and
self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the
limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are
resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory
during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that
outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data
storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage
during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and
current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from
multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the
paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 地块大小是农业社会经济和环境结果（如粮食生产、生计、森林砍伐）及其权衡的关键指标。

Abstract: The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of
smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental
system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and
field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation
data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex
agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference
data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first
national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering
~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural
land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission
errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union
(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field
delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture
fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global
land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural
frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in
Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16
ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial
resolution (0.05{\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of
accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation
reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder
farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.
Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to
socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food
production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their
trade-offs.

Motivation: 训练高压缩率的VQ-VAE通常需要大量计算资源，ReVQ旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练的VAE，结合通道多组量化和后矫正器，减少量化误差。

Conclusion: ReVQ在效率和重建质量之间取得了优越的平衡，显著降低了训练成本。

Abstract: Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges
between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training
high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often
necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained
VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization
noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present
\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs
to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By
integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook
capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ
compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive
reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training
costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches:
ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours,
whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental
results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

### [206] [Spatial ModernBERT: Spatial-Aware Transformer for Table and Key-Value Extraction in Financial Documents at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08865)
*Javis AI Team,Amrendra Singh,Maulik Shah,Dharshan Sampath*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型Spatial ModernBERT，用于从复杂财务文档中提取表格和键值对，通过空间嵌入和多头分类任务实现高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 财务文档中的表格和键值对提取对审计、数据分析和自动化发票处理等业务流程至关重要。

Method: 使用Spatial ModernBERT模型，结合空间嵌入，通过三个分类头（标签、列、行）进行标记分类，并在PubTables-1M数据集上预训练后微调。

Result: 模型在财务文档中表现出色，能够有效利用文本和空间线索实现高精度提取。

Conclusion: Spatial ModernBERT为财务文档中的表格和键值对提取提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Extracting tables and key-value pairs from financial documents is essential
for business workflows such as auditing, data analytics, and automated invoice
processing. In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based
model augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract
tabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the
extraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head,
classifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description,
Quantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices;
(3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model
is pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial
document dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on
each classification head. We propose a post-processing method to merge tokens
using B-I-IB tagging, reconstruct the tabular layout, and extract key-value
pairs. Empirical evaluation shows that Spatial ModernBERT effectively leverages
both textual and spatial cues, facilitating highly accurate table and key-value
extraction in real-world financial documents.

TL;DR: SEALGuard是一种多语言护栏，旨在解决现有护栏在多语言安全对齐上的不足，通过LoRA技术改进多语言不安全提示的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有护栏（如LlamaGuard）在多语言不安全输入（尤其是低资源语言）上表现不佳，导致LLM系统易受攻击。

Method: 采用低秩适应（LoRA）技术将通用多语言模型转化为多语言护栏，并构建了包含26万条多语言提示的SEALSBench数据集。

Result: SEALGuard在多语言不安全提示检测上显著优于LlamaGuard，DSR提升48%，并在DSR、精确率和F1分数上表现最佳。

Conclusion: SEALGuard通过有效的多语言护栏技术，显著提升了LLM系统的安全对齐能力。

Abstract: Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent
LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection
accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),
they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM
systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource
languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a
multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse
languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing
guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in
LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model
into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct
SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over
260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.
We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on
this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak
prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art
LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and
18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In
contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual
unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and
achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further
reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the
overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of
LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.

TL;DR: 论文分析了当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在医学问答中的局限性，重点关注评估数据集的质量，并提出标准化框架的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在医学问答中的表现时，现有数据集缺乏临床真实性、透明性和验证过程，需要更严谨的工具。

Method: 通过审查MedQA、MedMCQA、PubMedQA和MMLU等常用基准数据集，以及医学期刊的挑战问题，分析其优缺点。

Result: 现有数据集普遍缺乏临床现实性和透明度，挑战问题虽有益但规模小、范围窄且可能被LLM训练暴露。

Conclusion: 需要标准化框架和多方合作，以确保数据集和方法严谨、无偏见且反映临床复杂性。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the current limitations of large language models
(LLMs) in medical question answering, focusing on the quality of datasets used
for their evaluation. Materials and Methods: Widely-used benchmark datasets,
including MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU, were reviewed for their rigor,
transparency, and relevance to clinical scenarios. Alternatives, such as
challenge questions in medical journals, were also analyzed to identify their
potential as unbiased evaluation tools. Results: Most existing datasets lack
clinical realism, transparency, and robust validation processes. Publicly
available challenge questions offer some benefits but are limited by their
small size, narrow scope, and exposure to LLM training. These gaps highlight
the need for secure, comprehensive, and representative datasets. Conclusion: A
standardized framework is critical for evaluating LLMs in medicine.
Collaborative efforts among institutions and policymakers are needed to ensure
datasets and methodologies are rigorous, unbiased, and reflective of clinical
complexities.

TL;DR: SIMS是一种无需外部监督的自改进模型引导框架，通过自主生成和优化对比样本，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）的引导效果和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型引导方法依赖外部标注数据，限制了适应性和效果。SIMS旨在通过自改进框架解决这一问题。

Method: SIMS通过迭代自改进循环生成和优化对比样本，并结合提示排序和对比采样等策略提升引导效果。

Result: 实验表明，SIMS在多种LLM和基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 自改进模型引导是未来LLM推理对齐研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: Model steering represents a powerful technique that dynamically aligns large
language models (LLMs) with human preferences during inference. However,
conventional model-steering methods rely heavily on externally annotated data,
not only limiting their adaptability to varying contexts but also tethering
their effectiveness to annotation quality. In this paper, we present SIMS, the
first self-improving model-steering framework that operates without relying on
external supervision. At its core, SIMS autonomously generates and refines
contrastive samples through iterative self-improvement cycles, enabling
adaptive, context-specific steering. Additionally, SIMS employs novel
strategies, including prompt ranking and contrast sampling, to further enhance
steering efficacy. Extensive evaluation across diverse LLMs and benchmarks
demonstrates that SIMS substantially outperforms existing methods in steering
effectiveness and adaptability, highlighting self-improving model steering as a
promising direction for future research on inference-time LLM alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨EHR中污名化语言的普遍性及其对不同患者群体的影响。

Method: 通过扩展词典匹配和监督学习分类器识别MIMIC-III EHR中的怀疑标记和污名化标签，并使用泊松回归模型分析预测因素。

Result: 黑人、低收入患者和某些疾病患者的污名化标签率更高；护士和社会工作者的污名化语言使用率较高。

Conclusion: 污名化语言在历史上被污名化的患者中更为普遍，且由多种医疗提供者使用。

Abstract: Introduction: Electronic health records (EHR) are a critical medium through
which patient stigmatization is perpetuated among healthcare teams. Methods: We
identified linguistic features of doubt markers and stigmatizing labels in
MIMIC-III EHR via expanded lexicon matching and supervised learning
classifiers. Predictors of rates of linguistic features were assessed using
Poisson regression models. Results: We found higher rates of stigmatizing
labels per chart among patients who were Black or African American (RR: 1.16),
patients with Medicare/Medicaid or government-run insurance (RR: 2.46),
self-pay (RR: 2.12), and patients with a variety of stigmatizing disease and
mental health conditions. Patterns among doubt markers were similar, though
male patients had higher rates of doubt markers (RR: 1.25). We found increased
stigmatizing labels used by nurses (RR: 1.40), and social workers (RR: 2.25),
with similar patterns of doubt markers. Discussion: Stigmatizing language
occurred at higher rates among historically stigmatized patients, perpetuated
by multiple provider types.

TL;DR: 研究通过Ganzflicker诱导的视觉幻觉，探讨了不同视觉想象能力个体在幻觉内容上的差异。强想象者描述复杂自然内容，弱想象者报告简单几何模式。视觉语言模型能更好地捕捉这些差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉想象能力（从无想象到典型想象再到生动想象）如何影响Ganzflicker诱导的幻觉内容。

Method: 使用自然语言处理工具分析4000多名参与者对幻觉的自由文本描述，比较不同想象能力个体的描述差异。

Result: 强想象者描述复杂自然内容，弱想象者报告简单几何模式；视觉语言模型比纯文本模型更能捕捉这些差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果可能反映了早期视觉区域与高阶区域在协调上的个体差异，与想象能力谱相关。

Abstract: A rapidly alternating red and black display known as Ganzflicker induces
visual hallucinations that reflect the generative capacity of the visual
system. Recent proposals regarding the imagery spectrum, that is, differences
in the visual system of individuals with absent imagery, typical imagery, and
vivid imagery, suggest these differences should impact the complexity of other
internally generated visual experiences. Here, we used tools from natural
language processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from
over 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery
phenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced
hallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while
weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision
language models better captured these differences than text-only language
models, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer
sensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in
coordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for
the imagery spectrum.

TL;DR: Lizard是一个线性化框架，将预训练的Transformer大语言模型转化为支持无限上下文生成的次二次复杂度架构，解决了内存和计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大语言模型在长上下文生成时面临内存和计算瓶颈，Lizard旨在通过次二次复杂度注意力机制解决这一问题。

Method: Lizard引入次二次注意力机制，结合门控模块和混合机制（全局压缩与局部滑动窗口注意力），并采用硬件感知算法加速训练。

Result: 实验表明，Lizard在标准语言建模任务中几乎无损恢复教师模型性能，在MMLU基准上提升18分，并在关联召回任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: Lizard通过灵活的架构设计和高效的注意力机制，显著提升了长上下文生成的能力和性能。

Abstract: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained
Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic
architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face
significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,
due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value
(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic
attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while
preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are
often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating
mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent
state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports
constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more
flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global
context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,
forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and
fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware
algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive
experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher
model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while
significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU
benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant
improvements on associative recall tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户多样化需求和偏好需要LLM个性化对齐方法，现有工具仅关注基准任务。

Method: ALIGN系统采用提示对齐、结构化输出生成和可替换LLM核心算法。

Result: 系统支持定性和定量分析，并在公共意见调查和医疗分诊中验证对齐方法。

Conclusion: ALIGN开源框架为可靠、负责和个性化的LLM决策提供新研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as decision aids.
However, users have diverse values and preferences that can affect their
decision-making, which requires novel methods for LLM alignment and
personalization. Existing LLM comparison tools largely focus on benchmarking
tasks, such as knowledge-based question answering. In contrast, our proposed
ALIGN system focuses on dynamic personalization of LLM-based decision-makers
through prompt-based alignment to a set of fine-grained attributes. Key
features of our system include robust configuration management, structured
output generation with reasoning, and several algorithm implementations with
swappable LLM backbones, enabling different types of analyses. Our user
interface enables a qualitative, side-by-side comparison of LLMs and their
alignment to various attributes, with a modular backend for easy algorithm
integration. Additionally, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing
alignment approaches in two different domains: demographic alignment for public
opinion surveys and value alignment for medical triage decision-making. The
entire ALIGN framework is open source and will enable new research on reliable,
responsible, and personalized LLM-based decision-makers.

Motivation: 大规模高质量数据集对代码生成和评论的进展至关重要，现有数据集规模不足。

Method: 采用两阶段监督微调策略，首阶段专注于代码生成，次阶段联合训练代码生成和评论模型。

Conclusion: OpenCodeReasoning-II数据集和联合训练方法为代码推理任务提供了有效解决方案，并扩展了LiveCodeBench基准以支持C++。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-based Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly their potential through test-time scaling, have created
significant opportunities for distillation in code generation and critique.
However, progress in both areas fundamentally depends on large-scale,
high-quality datasets. In this work, we introduce OpenCodeReasoning-II, a
dataset consists of 2.5M question-solution-critique triples (approx. 35K unique
programming questions), making it nearly twice the size of the previous largest
publicly available code reasoning dataset. In this work, we employ a two-stage
supervised fine-tuning strategy. The first stage focuses on fine-tuning for
code generation, while the second stage involves the joint training of models
for both code generation and critique. Our resulting finetuned Qwen2.5-Instruct
models achieve performance in code generation that either exceeds or equals the
best prior open-weight distilled models. Notably, the integration of our code
generation and critique models leads to significant improvements in competitive
coding performance. Furthermore, we present an extension of the LiveCodeBench
benchmark to specifically support the C++ programming language, thereby
facilitating more comprehensive LLM evaluation using this benchmark.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态参数记忆（DPM）机制，用于解决语音大语言模型（SLLM）在长音频序列情感识别中的限制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音模态的高帧率限制了SLLM的信号处理和理解能力，现有方法忽视了情感在对话中的连续性和惯性。

Method: 提出DPM机制，结合上下文语义和句子级情感编码，通过临时LoRA模块逐步记忆上下文信息。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，DPM显著提升了SLLM处理长音频序列的情感识别能力，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DPM机制有效解决了SLLM在长音频处理中的限制，为情感识别任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to
improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame
rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding
capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only
process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its
capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the
continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This
paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual
semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of
unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM
progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary
LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual
information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM
into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental
results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion
recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences,
achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CompassJudger-2提升了评判模型的鲁棒性和可扩展性，并提出了新的评估标准JudgerBenchV2。

Abstract: Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has
gained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow
specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for
comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel
generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven,
multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising
judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning
through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment
capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy
gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves
superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model
demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models
like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank
consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance
robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation
standards.

Motivation: 解决传统扫描教材可能带来的版权问题，同时填补小模型在晶体学领域的知识空白。

Method: 通过GPT-4.5生成紧凑的领域特定参考内容，并在217个专家级XRD问题上评估不同视觉语言模型的性能。

Result: 使用GPT-4.5生成摘要的模型在准确性上有显著提升，尤其是在晶体学训练有限的情况下。

Conclusion: OPENXRD展示了专业开卷系统在材料科学中的潜力，并为科学领域的自然语言处理工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: This work presents OPENXRD, an open-book pipeline designed for
crystallography question answering, which integrates textual prompts with
concise supporting content generated by GPT-4.5. Instead of using scanned
textbooks, which may lead to copyright issues, OPENXRD generates compact,
domain-specific references that help smaller models understand key concepts in
X-ray diffraction (XRD). We evaluate OPENXRD on a well-defined set of 217
expert-level XRD questions by comparing different vision-language models,
including GPT-4 and LLaVA-based frameworks such as Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN,
under both closed-book (without supporting material) and open-book (with
supporting material) conditions. Our experimental results show significant
accuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries,
particularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses
knowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and
shows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively
in scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based
inputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams
or diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials
science contexts. Overall, OPENXRD shows that specialized open-book systems can
be useful in materials science and provides a foundation for broader natural
language processing (NLP) tools in critical scientific fields.

Motivation: 战略对话中的欺骗检测因语言微妙性和类别不平衡而复杂且高风险，传统方法难以应对。

Method: 结合冻结BERT嵌入、可解释的语言和游戏特定特征，采用PU学习目标，针对少量标注的欺骗信息进行建模。

Result: 模型在Diplomacy数据集上达到0.60的宏F1，同时减少650倍可训练参数。

Conclusion: PU学习、语言可解释性和说话者感知表示在此任务中具有重要价值，准确检测欺骗比识别真实信息更关键。

Abstract: Detecting deception in strategic dialogues is a complex and high-stakes task
due to the subtlety of language and extreme class imbalance between deceptive
and truthful communications. In this work, we revisit deception detection in
the Diplomacy dataset, where less than 5% of messages are labeled deceptive. We
introduce a lightweight yet effective model combining frozen BERT embeddings,
interpretable linguistic and game-specific features, and a Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) learning objective. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, PU-Lie is
tailored for situations where only a small portion of deceptive messages are
labeled, and the majority are unlabeled. Our model achieves a new best macro F1
of 0.60 while reducing trainable parameters by over 650x. Through comprehensive
evaluations and ablation studies across seven models, we demonstrate the value
of PU learning, linguistic interpretability, and speaker-aware representations.
Notably, we emphasize that in this problem setting, accurately detecting
deception is more critical than identifying truthful messages. This priority
guides our choice of PU learning, which explicitly models the rare but vital
deceptive class.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimodal misinformation presents significant
challenges for automated fact-checking systems, especially when claims are
ambiguous or lack sufficient context. We introduce RAMA, a novel
retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia
misinformation. RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query
formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries;
(2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative
sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the
complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt
variants. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior
performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving
ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual
evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based
evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification,
paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. RAMA
will be publicly available at https://github.com/kalendsyang/RAMA.git.

*Ameen Ali,Shahar Katz,Lior Wolf,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过剪枝神经元来提升大语言模型泛化能力的微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）常依赖数据集特定的机制，导致在新任务或分布上性能下降，因此需要提升其泛化能力。

Method: 使用Integrated Gradients量化神经元对高置信度预测的影响，剪枝与数据集特定机制相关的神经元。

Result: 在多选题基准测试中，该方法显著提升了性能，超越了之前的非剪枝适应方法。

Conclusion: 通过剪枝数据集特定神经元，模型能更依赖泛化表示，提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often develop learned mechanisms specialized to
specific datasets, such as reliance on domain-specific correlations, which
yield high-confidence predictions without generalizable reasoning. While
beneficial in one setting, these dataset-specific mechanisms typically degrade
performance when models encounter novel tasks or distributions. In this work,
we introduce a fine-tuning approach designed to enhance generalization by
identifying and pruning neurons associated with dataset-specific mechanisms in
transformer-based LLMs. Our method employs Integrated Gradients to quantify
each neuron's influence on high-confidence predictions, pinpointing those that
disproportionately contribute to dataset-specific performance without
supporting robust, transferable reasoning. Selectively pruning these neurons
compels the model to depend on generalizable representations. Evaluated across
multiple-choice benchmarks, our pruning-based fine-tuning significantly
enhances performance, surpassing prior (non-pruning) adaptation methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Banzhida，一个针对藏语的多语言大模型，通过构建最大的藏语预训练语料库，显著提升了藏语生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 藏语作为低资源语言在现有模型中代表性不足，缺乏高质量训练语料。

Method: 构建最大的藏语预训练语料库，通过专门的数据清洗和处理流程，继续预训练多语言基础模型。

Result: Banzhida在多种任务中显著优于类似规模的开源模型和针对藏语的模型。

Conclusion: Banzhida为藏语生成AI提供了重要进展，填补了低资源语言的空白。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable progress across many
languages. However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is
particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of
high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest
Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and
applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for
Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual
base model into Banzhida, a multilingual large language model that advances
generative AI for Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model,
we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with
existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Banzhida
consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar
scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.

*Biagio Scalingi,Chiara Barattieri di San Pietro,Paolo Canal,Valentina Bambini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了视觉隐喻（如融化的冰川表现为融化的冰手榴弹）在气候变化传播中的效果，发现其虽更难理解但更具美感，且能引发更积极的认知体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉隐喻在环境传播中的实际效果，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 构建MetaClimage数据库，收集人类评分和标签数据，结合自然语言处理分析语义和情感变量。

Result: 视觉隐喻比直白图像更难理解但更美观，未在效果和情感唤起上显著差异，但能引发更多标签和积极情感。

Conclusion: 视觉隐喻虽增加认知负担，但能促进更深层次的认知加工和积极体验，为环境传播提供权衡参考。

Abstract: Visual metaphors of climate change (e.g., melting glaciers depicted as a
melting ice grenade) are regarded as valuable tools for addressing the
complexity of environmental challenges. However, few studies have examined
their impact on communication, also due to scattered availability of material.
Here, we present a novel database of Metaphors of Climate Change in Images
(MetaClimage) https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15861012, paired with literal
images and enriched with human ratings. For each image, we collected values of
difficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human
rating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the
message. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via
Natural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to
understand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not
differ in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was
higher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual
metaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the
image, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than
literal images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual
metaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper
cognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore,
while they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem
to generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced
experience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the impact of
visual metaphors of climate change both by offering a database for future
research and by elucidating a cost-benefit trade-off to take into account when
shaping environmental communication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种心理学启发的幽默分解机制（HDM），结合Chain-of-Thought（CoT）和幽默理论，显著提升了大型语言模型在幽默翻译中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在幽默翻译中存在语言干扰和缺乏幽默感的问题，需要改进。

Method: 采用心理学启发的HDM，结合CoT模仿人类思维过程，并融入幽默理论。

Result: 在开源幽默数据集上的实验显示，幽默、流畅性和连贯性分别平均提升7.75%、2.81%和6.13%。

Conclusion: HDM有效提升了幽默翻译的质量，为跨文化沟通提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Humour translation plays a vital role as a bridge between different cultures,
fostering understanding and communication. Although most existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) are capable of general translation tasks, these models
still struggle with humour translation, which is especially reflected through
linguistic interference and lacking humour in translated text. In this paper,
we propose a psychology-inspired Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM) that
utilises Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to imitate the ability of the human thought
process, stimulating LLMs to optimise the readability of translated humorous
texts. Moreover, we integrate humour theory in HDM to further enhance the
humorous elements in the translated text. Our automatic evaluation experiments
on open-source humour datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
improves the quality of humour translation, yielding average gains of 7.75\% in
humour, 2.81\% in fluency, and 6.13\% in coherence of the generated text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 痴呆症影响语音模式，现有语音技术难以处理，需解决隐私和可访问性问题。

Method: 结合ASR、文本混淆和零样本TTS，无需微调即可修正语音并保留说话者身份。

Result: 在ADReSS和ADReSSo数据集上，F1分数下降16%和10%，但WER显著改善，语音质量提升。

Conclusion: ClaritySpeech有效提升痴呆症语音的可访问性和隐私保护，适用于低数据环境。

Abstract: Dementia, a neurodegenerative disease, alters speech patterns, creating
communication barriers and raising privacy concerns. Current speech
technologies, such as automatic speech transcription (ASR), struggle with
dementia and atypical speech, further challenging accessibility. This paper
presents a novel dementia obfuscation in speech framework, ClaritySpeech,
integrating ASR, text obfuscation, and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) to
correct dementia-affected speech while preserving speaker identity in low-data
environments without fine-tuning. Results show a 16% and 10% drop in mean F1
score across various adversarial settings and modalities (audio, text, fusion)
for ADReSS and ADReSSo, respectively, maintaining 50% speaker similarity. We
also find that our system improves WER (from 0.73 to 0.08 for ADReSS and 0.15
for ADReSSo) and speech quality from 1.65 to ~2.15, enhancing privacy and
accessibility.

TL;DR: DATE-LM是一个用于评估数据归因方法的统一基准，通过三个关键任务衡量归因质量，并发现现有方法在不同任务中存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对数据归因方法的系统性评估，尤其是在语言模型（LLM）中的应用。

Method: 引入DATE-LM基准，通过训练数据选择、毒性/偏见过滤和事实归因三个任务评估归因方法。

Result: 研究发现，没有单一方法在所有任务中表现最佳，且方法性能受任务设计影响。

Conclusion: DATE-LM为未来LLM数据归因研究提供了基础，并发布了公开排行榜以促进社区参与。

Abstract: Data attribution methods quantify the influence of training data on model
outputs and are becoming increasingly relevant for a wide range of LLM research
and applications, including dataset curation, model interpretability, data
valuation. However, there remain critical gaps in systematic LLM-centric
evaluation of data attribution methods. To this end, we introduce DATE-LM (Data
Attribution Evaluation in Language Models), a unified benchmark for evaluating
data attribution methods through real-world LLM applications. DATE-LM measures
attribution quality through three key tasks -- training data selection,
toxicity/bias filtering, and factual attribution. Our benchmark is designed for
ease of use, enabling researchers to configure and run large-scale evaluations
across diverse tasks and LLM architectures. Furthermore, we use DATE-LM to
conduct a large-scale evaluation of existing data attribution methods. Our
findings show that no single method dominates across all tasks, data
attribution methods have trade-offs with simpler baselines, and method
performance is sensitive to task-specific evaluation design. Finally, we
release a public leaderboard for quick comparison of methods and to facilitate
community engagement. We hope DATE-LM serves as a foundation for future data
attribution research in LLMs.

Method: 使用400例临床案例训练模型，调整序列长度、学习率、训练轮次，并加入医学术语。

Result: 优化后模型性能显著提升：准确率从72.0%升至85.2%，F1分数从71.0%升至85.2%。

Conclusion: 优化模型在临床NLP中表现优异，具有广泛医疗应用潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the optimization of the DRAGON Longformer base model for
clinical text classification, specifically targeting the binary classification
of medical case descriptions. A dataset of 500 clinical cases containing
structured medical observations was used, with 400 cases for training and 100
for validation. Enhancements to the pre-trained
joeranbosma/dragon-longformer-base-mixed-domain model included hyperparameter
tuning, domain-specific preprocessing, and architectural adjustments. Key
modifications involved increasing sequence length from 512 to 1024 tokens,
adjusting learning rates from 1e-05 to 5e-06, extending training epochs from 5
to 8, and incorporating specialized medical terminology. The optimized model
achieved notable performance gains: accuracy improved from 72.0% to 85.2%,
precision from 68.0% to 84.1%, recall from 75.0% to 86.3%, and F1-score from
71.0% to 85.2%. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these
improvements (p < .001). The model demonstrated enhanced capability in
interpreting medical terminology, anatomical measurements, and clinical
observations. These findings contribute to domain-specific language model
research and offer practical implications for clinical natural language
processing applications. The optimized model's strong performance across
diverse medical conditions underscores its potential for broad use in
healthcare settings.

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括更有效、多模态适应、可信赖且以人为中心的RAG-推理系统。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems
that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented
approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both
strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how
advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then,
we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and
expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we
spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs
iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art
performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods,
datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper
RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive,
trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available at

Motivation: 现有讽刺生成研究依赖文本模态且忽视视觉线索，导致图像内容与讽刺意图不匹配。

Method: 提出ViSP框架，结合PPO和对比学习，利用DIP奖励分数优化讽刺文本生成。

Result: ViSP在五个指标上超越基线模型，生成文本的讽刺分数（0.898 vs. 0.770）和事实不一致性（0.768 vs. 0.739）更高。

Conclusion: ViSP能生成更高质量的讽刺内容，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Human emotions are complex, with sarcasm being a subtle and distinctive form.
Despite progress in sarcasm research, sarcasm generation remains underexplored,
primarily due to the overreliance on textual modalities and the neglect of
visual cues, as well as the mismatch between image content and sarcastic intent
in existing datasets. In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm
generation dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic
text, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation
framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive
learning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of
sarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor
outputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation
quality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate
ViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including
large language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation.
Furthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual
Incongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP. The generated texts
exhibit higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity
(0.768 vs. 0.739), demonstrating that ViSP produces higher-quality sarcastic
content than the original dataset. % The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Our dataset and code will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ABSA研究因短文本和小规模不平衡数据难以充分学习上下文信息，数据增强虽可行但质量难以保证。

Method: 利用LLM生成增强数据以平衡标签分布，并通过强化学习优化数据质量。

Result: 在英文ABSA基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过数据增强和强化学习显著提升了ABSA任务的性能。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial fine-grained task in
social media scenarios to identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspect
terms in a sentence. Although many existing studies leverage large language
models (LLMs) to perform ABSA due to their strong context understanding
capabilities, they still face challenges to learn the context information in
the running text because of the short text, as well as the small and unbalanced
labeled training data, where most data are labeled with positive sentiment.
Data augmentation (DA) is a feasible strategy for providing richer contextual
information, especially when using LLMs to create synthetic training data, but
faces challenges in ensuring a high quality of the augmented data.In this
paper, we propose an LLM-based ABSA approach with training data
augmentation.Specifically, an LLM is prompted to generate augmented training
data based on the original training data, so as to construct a new training
data with larger size and balanced label distributions to better train an ABSA
model. Meanwhile, in order to improve the quality of the augmented data, we
propose a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the data augmentation.
LLM.Experiment results and further analyses on English benchmark datasets for
ABSA demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where superior performance
is observed over strong baselines and most existing studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单用途AI系统在协调性、记忆重用和任务分解方面存在不足，难以满足复杂动态任务需求。

Method: 采用Agent-to-Agent通信层（基于MCP协议）和Experience Pack分层记忆系统，支持异步交互和知识保留。

Result: 在复杂任务编排基准测试中，GoalfyMax展现出优于基线框架的适应性、协调性和经验重用能力。

Conclusion: GoalfyMax为多智能体系统提供了可扩展的未来解决方案。

Abstract: Modern enterprise environments demand intelligent systems capable of handling
complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted tasks with high levels of autonomy and
adaptability. However, traditional single-purpose AI systems often lack
sufficient coordination, memory reuse, and task decomposition capabilities,
limiting their scalability in realistic settings. To address these challenges,
we present \textbf{GoalfyMax}, a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end
multi-agent collaboration. GoalfyMax introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) communication layer built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing
independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous, protocol-compliant
interactions. It incorporates the Experience Pack (XP) architecture, a layered
memory system that preserves both task rationales and execution traces,
enabling structured knowledge retention and continual learning. Moreover, our
system integrates advanced features including multi-turn contextual dialogue,
long-short term memory modules, and dynamic safety validation, supporting
robust, real-time strategy adaptation. Empirical results on complex task
orchestration benchmarks and case study demonstrate that GoalfyMax achieves
superior adaptability, coordination, and experience reuse compared to baseline
frameworks. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, future-ready
foundation for multi-agent intelligent systems.

Motivation: 长上下文引用是LCLMs的关键任务，但尚未充分研究，因此需要开发专门的评估基准。

Method: 设计Ref-Long基准，包含三个子集（合成到现实场景），要求模型识别引用特定关键词的文档索引。

Result: 实验显示13个LCLMs在长上下文引用任务中存在显著不足，即使高级模型如GPT-4o也表现不佳。

Conclusion: Ref-Long揭示了LCLMs在长上下文引用任务中的挑战，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Long-context language models (LCLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities
in long-context understanding tasks. Among these, long-context referencing -- a
crucial task that requires LCLMs to attribute items of interest to specific
parts of long-context data -- remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this
paper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models
(Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing
capability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the
indexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual
relationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval. Based on
the task design, we construct three subsets ranging from synthetic to realistic
scenarios to form the Ref-Long benchmark. Experimental results of 13 LCLMs
reveal significant shortcomings in long-context referencing, even among
advanced models like GPT-4o. To further investigate these challenges, we
conduct comprehensive analyses, including human evaluations, task format
adjustments, fine-tuning experiments, and error analyses, leading to several
key insights. Our data and code can be found in https://github.

Method: 通过定量和定性分析，评估不同类型和程度的提示错误对LLM在翻译和翻译评估任务中的影响。

Result: 提示质量显著影响翻译性能，字符级和组合噪声比短语扰动更严重；LLM在极高噪声下仍能翻译。

Conclusion: 提示错误主要影响指令遵循而非翻译质量本身，LLM对噪声的鲁棒性超出人类预期。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved top results in recent machine
translation evaluations, but they are also known to be sensitive to errors and
perturbations in their prompts. We systematically evaluate how both humanly
plausible and synthetic errors in user prompts affect LLMs' performance on two
related tasks: Machine translation and machine translation evaluation. We
provide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the
models respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.
  The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many
errors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without
errors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently,
with character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than
phrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality
largely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting
translation quality itself. Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with
overwhelming random noise that would make the prompt illegible to humans.

Abstract: Definition modeling, the task of generating new definitions for words in
context, holds great prospect as a means to assist the work of lexicographers
in documenting a broader variety of lects and languages, yet much remains to be
done in order to assess how we can leverage pre-existing models for as-of-yet

Belarusian, for which we propose a novel dataset of 43,150 definitions. Our
experiments demonstrate that adapting a definition modeling systems requires
minimal amounts of data, but that there currently are gaps in what automatic
metrics do capture.

*Hanwool Lee,Sara Yu,Yewon Hwang,Jonghyun Choi,Heejae Ahn,Sungbum Jung,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NMIXX模型通过跨语言金融嵌入和KorFinSTS基准测试，提升了金融领域语义捕捉能力，尤其在韩语等低资源语言中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用句子嵌入模型难以捕捉金融领域的专业语义，特别是在低资源语言（如韩语）中，存在领域术语、时间语义变化和双语词汇不对齐等问题。

Method: 提出NMIXX模型，通过18.8K高质量三元组（领域内释义、语义变化负样本和韩英精确翻译）进行微调，并发布KorFinSTS基准测试。

Result: NMIXX在英语FinSTS和韩语KorFinSTS上分别提升0.10和0.22的Spearman's rho，优于其他基线模型，但通用STS性能略有下降。

Conclusion: NMIXX和KorFinSTS为金融领域的跨语言表示学习提供了有效工具，强调了分词设计在低资源语言中的重要性。

Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture
specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like
Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned
bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural
eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual
embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair
in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology,
and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a
1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research
reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks
miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual
bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and
+0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing
other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in
general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer
Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of
tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models
and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust
tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpreadPy是一个用于模拟认知单层和多层网络中激活传播的Python库，支持结构-功能关系的数值模拟研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究认知、心理和临床现象中激活动态与网络结构的关系。

Method: 通过数值模拟和案例研究（数学焦虑、创造力任务、失语症）验证工具的有效性。

Result: SpreadPy能区分不同认知状态（如高/低数学焦虑）、任务难度对激活轨迹的影响，以及失语症患者的错误类型与网络结构的相关性。

Conclusion: SpreadPy为心理学、神经科学和教育研究提供了可重复的研究工具，支持理论和实证网络的建模。

Abstract: We introduce SpreadPy as a Python library for simulating spreading activation
in cognitive single-layer and multiplex networks. Our tool is designed to
perform numerical simulations testing structure-function relationships in
cognitive processes. By comparing simulation results with grounded theories in
knowledge modelling, SpreadPy enables systematic investigations of how
activation dynamics reflect cognitive, psychological and clinical phenomena. We
demonstrate the library's utility through three case studies: (1) Spreading
activation on associative knowledge networks distinguishes students with high
versus low math anxiety, revealing anxiety-related structural differences in
conceptual organization; (2) Simulations of a creativity task show that
activation trajectories vary with task difficulty, exposing how cognitive load
modulates lexical access; (3) In individuals with aphasia, simulated activation
patterns on lexical networks correlate with empirical error types (semantic vs.
phonological) during picture-naming tasks, linking network structure to
clinical impairments. SpreadPy's flexible framework allows researchers to model
these processes using empirically derived or theoretical networks, providing
mechanistic insights into individual differences and cognitive impairments. The
library is openly available, supporting reproducible research in psychology,
neuroscience, and education research.

Motivation: 探索知识编辑在形态丰富的语言（如阿拉伯语）中的行为，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Method: 评估了四种方法（ROME、MEMIT、ICE和LTE）在阿拉伯语翻译数据集上的表现，并扩展了LTE到多语言环境。

Result: 参数化方法在跨语言泛化上表现不佳，而指令调优方法更稳健；多语言联合训练提升了编辑和迁移能力。

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语知识编辑的研究为未来工作提供了基准和多语言训练数据，支持进一步探索。

Abstract: While Knowledge Editing (KE) has been widely explored in English, its
behavior in morphologically rich languages like Arabic remains underexamined.
In this work, we present the first study of Arabic KE. We evaluate four methods
(ROME, MEMIT, ICE, and LTE) on Arabic translations of the ZsRE and Counterfact
benchmarks, analyzing both multilingual and cross-lingual settings. Our
experiments on Llama-2-7B-chat show show that parameter-based methods struggle
with cross-lingual generalization, while instruction-tuned methods perform more
robustly. We extend Learning-To-Edit (LTE) to a multilingual setting and show
that joint Arabic-English training improves both editability and transfer. We
release Arabic KE benchmarks and multilingual training for LTE data to support
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 泰语法律问答系统中RAG的性能有限，尤其是在需要复杂法律推理的问题上。

Method: 采用Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法，结合BGE-M3嵌入作为语义相似性奖励，显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在NitiBench基准测试中，GRPO实现了90%的引用-F1提升和31%的联合质量指标提升，且在复杂法律推理任务中表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升泰语法律LLM提供了一种高效且资源节约的解决方案。

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems' performance on Thai legal
question answering is still limited, especially for questions requiring
extensive, complex legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce
an approach aligning LLMs toward improved law citation accuracy and better
response quality using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach
leverages BGE-M3 embeddings as a cost-efficient semantic-similarity reward,
significantly reducing computational expenses up to 2.5x compared to large
language model judges. Experiments on the NitiBench benchmark demonstrate
substantial improvements: GRPO achieves up to 90% citation-F1 gains from the
base model and a 31% increase in joint quality metrics over instruction tuning.
Crucially, our method shows enhanced robustness on complex legal reasoning
tasks compared to instruction tuning, providing an effective and
resource-efficient solution for enhancing Thai legal LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在文化偏见和跨文化理解能力不足的问题，尤其是在服务全球多样化用户时。

Method: 采用动态文化问题构建和反事实重述、混杂重述进行因果分析，评估文化意识和文化偏见。

Result: 实验结果显示性能差异与训练数据分布和语言-文化对齐相关，并揭示了公平性问题。

Conclusion: MCEval是首个全面的多语言文化评估框架，为LLMs的文化理解提供了深入见解。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit cultural biases and limited cross-cultural
understanding capabilities, particularly when serving diverse global user
populations. We propose MCEval, a novel multilingual evaluation framework that
employs dynamic cultural question construction and enables causal analysis
through Counterfactual Rephrasing and Confounder Rephrasing. Our comprehensive
evaluation spans 13 cultures and 13 languages, systematically assessing both
cultural awareness and cultural bias across different linguistic scenarios. The
framework provides 39,897 cultural awareness instances and 17,940 cultural bias
instances. Experimental results reveal performance disparities across different
linguistic scenarios, demonstrating that optimal cultural performance is not
only linked to training data distribution, but also is related to
language-culture alignment. The evaluation results also expose the fairness
issue, where approaches appearing successful in the English scenario create
substantial disadvantages. MCEval represents the first comprehensive
multilingual cultural evaluation framework that provides deeper insights into
LLMs' cultural understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）的潜在空间中，高级语义信息集中在低维子空间，且在不同领域中线性可分。这种可分性在深层和结构化推理提示下更明显，支持几何感知工具的开发。


<details>

Motivation: 探索LLM内部语义表示的组织方式，以提升模型解释性和对齐性。

Method: 对11个基于Transformer的LLM进行大规模实证研究，分析6个科学主题和12层的隐藏状态。

Result: 语义信息在低维子空间中线性可分，深层和结构化推理提示下更明显，支持简单因果干预。

Conclusion: 几何感知工具可直接操作潜在表示，用于检测和防御有害内容，如轻量级MLP分类器作为潜在空间护栏。

Abstract: Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is
key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. \baturay{However,
it remains unclear to what extent LLMs internally organize representations
related to semantic understanding. To investigate this, we conduct a
large-scale empirical study of hidden states in transformer-based LLMs,
analyzing 11 decoder-only models across 6 scientific topics and 12 layers each.
We find that high-level semantic information consistently lies in
low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across
distinct domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers
and under prompts that trigger structured reasoning or alignment
behaviors$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content is unchanged. This geometry
enables simple yet effective causal interventions in hidden space; for example,
reasoning patterns like chain-of-thought can be captured by a single vector
direction. Together, these findings support the development of geometry-aware
tools that operate directly on latent representations to detect and mitigate
harmful or adversarial content, using methods such as transport-based defenses
that leverage this separability. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this
potential by training a simple MLP classifier as a lightweight latent-space
guardrail, which detects adversarial and malicious prompts with high precision.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应的课程学习范式，利用预训练语言模型预测难度分数，优化微调顺序，实验表明其优于随机采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有课程学习方法依赖人工定义的难度指标（如文本长度），可能无法准确反映模型视角，因此提出自适应的难度评分方法。

Method: 基于预训练语言模型预测的难度分数，探索了从易到难、从难到易及混合采样的不同训练策略。

Result: 在四个自然语言理解数据集上验证，该方法比随机采样收敛更快且性能更优。

Conclusion: 自适应的课程学习范式能有效提升模型训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Curriculum learning is a widely adopted training strategy in natural language
processing (NLP), where models are exposed to examples organized by increasing
difficulty to enhance learning efficiency and performance. However, most
existing approaches rely on manually defined difficulty metrics -- such as text
length -- which may not accurately reflect the model's own perspective. To
overcome this limitation, we present a self-adaptive curriculum learning
paradigm that prioritizes fine-tuning examples based on difficulty scores
predicted by pre-trained language models (PLMs) themselves. Building on these
scores, we explore various training strategies that differ in the ordering of
examples for the fine-tuning: from easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, to mixed
sampling. We evaluate our method on four natural language understanding (NLU)
datasets covering both binary and multi-class classification tasks.
Experimental results show that our approach leads to faster convergence and
improved performance compared to standard random sampling.

TL;DR: 论文重新定义了点击诱饵，提出好奇心差距是其核心特征，并创建了首个西班牙语点击诱饵检测开源数据集TA1C。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对点击诱饵的定义缺乏共识，研究旨在明确其与类似现象的区别。

Method: 提出新定义，优化数据集标注标准，创建并发布TA1C数据集，实现高标注一致性。

Result: TA1C数据集包含3,500条推文，标注一致性达0.825，基线模型F1分数为0.84。

Conclusion: 研究为点击诱饵检测提供了更清晰的定义和高质量数据集，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: We revise the definition of clickbait, which lacks current consensus, and
argue that the creation of a curiosity gap is the key concept that
distinguishes clickbait from other related phenomena such as sensationalism and
headlines that do not deliver what they promise or diverge from the article.
Therefore, we propose a new definition: clickbait is a technique for generating
headlines and teasers that deliberately omit part of the information with the
goal of raising the readers' curiosity, capturing their attention and enticing
them to click. We introduce a new approach to clickbait detection datasets
creation, by refining the concept limits and annotations criteria, minimizing
the subjectivity in the decision as much as possible. Following it, we created
and release TA1C (for Te Ahorr\'e Un Click, Spanish for Saved You A Click), the
first open source dataset for clickbait detection in Spanish. It consists of
3,500 tweets coming from 18 well known media sources, manually annotated and
reaching a 0.825 Fleiss' K inter annotator agreement. We implement strong
baselines that achieve 0.84 in F1-score.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在未见任务中表现优异的内部机制，特别是通过‘错位加法’任务分析其泛化能力。

Method: 使用路径修补等电路式可解释性技术，分析模型在‘错位加法’任务中的内部计算过程。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型内部的可重用和可组合结构如何支持任务级泛化，为理解模型能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen
tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms
inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we
approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3,
2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function
as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as
path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their
notable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a
function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from
standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the
structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it
to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1
function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which
emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function
induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic
tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8
addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and
composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进RAG系统的新框架，通过分层文本分割和聚类生成更有语义的块，提升了检索的精确性和上下文相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分块方法未能充分捕捉语义，因未考虑文本结构，导致检索效果不佳。

Method: 整合分层文本分割和聚类，生成语义连贯的块，并在推理时结合段级和簇级向量表示进行检索。

Result: 在NarrativeQA、QuALITY和QASPER数据集上表现优于传统分块方法。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了RAG系统的检索效果，生成更有意义的块。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly use chunking strategies
for retrieval, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to
access external knowledge, ensuring that the retrieved information is
up-to-date and domain-specific. However, traditional methods often fail to
create chunks that capture sufficient semantic meaning, as they do not account
for the underlying textual structure. This paper proposes a novel framework
that enhances RAG by integrating hierarchical text segmentation and clustering
to generate more meaningful and semantically coherent chunks. During inference,
the framework retrieves information by leveraging both segment-level and
cluster-level vector representations, thereby increasing the likelihood of
retrieving more precise and contextually relevant information. Evaluations on
the NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets indicate that the proposed method
achieved improved results compared to traditional chunking techniques.

Motivation: 随着奖励模型在测试时策略中的部署增加，其推理成本成为问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合FLAN风格提示、定向低秩适应（DoRA）和层冻结技术，优化小型模型性能。

Result: TinyRM在RewardBench上表现优异，资源消耗显著减少。

Conclusion: 小型模型在特定领域调优中表现突出，双向架构有望成为高效、可扩展的偏好建模方案。

Abstract: Large decoder-based language models have become the dominant architecture for
reward modeling in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However,
as reward models are increasingly deployed in test-time strategies, their
inference costs become a growing concern. We present TinyRM, a family of small,
bidirectional masked language models (MLMs) with as few as 400 million
parameters, that rival the capabilities of models over 175 times larger on
reasoning and safety preference modeling tasks. TinyRM combines FLAN-style
prompting, Directional Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), and layer freezing to
achieve strong performance on RewardBench, despite using significantly fewer
resources. Our experiments suggest that small models benefit from
domain-specific tuning strategies, particularly in reasoning, where lightweight
finetuning methods are especially effective. While challenges remain in
building generalist models and conversational preference modeling, our
preliminary results highlight the promise of lightweight bidirectional
architectures as efficient, scalable alternatives for preference modeling.

Result: 实验证明TextOmics有效，ToDi优于现有方法，并在零样本分子生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: TextOmics和ToDi为靶向药物发现提供了新工具，展示了生成治疗潜力分子的潜力。

Abstract: Hit-like molecular generation with therapeutic potential is essential for
target-specific drug discovery. However, the field lacks heterogeneous data and
unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce TextOmics, a pioneering benchmark that establishes
one-to-one correspondences between omics expressions and molecular textual
descriptions. TextOmics provides a heterogeneous dataset that facilitates
molecular generation through representations alignment. Built upon this
foundation, we propose ToDi, a generative framework that jointly conditions on
omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions to produce biologically
relevant, chemically valid, hit-like molecules. ToDi leverages two encoders
(OmicsEn and TextEn) to capture multi-level biological and semantic
associations, and develops conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable
generation. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of TextOmics and
demonstrate ToDi outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, while also
showcasing remarkable potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注静态自杀风险检测，忽略了动态风险波动和保护因素的作用，限制了预测能力。

Method: 构建了一个包含风险和保护因素的新型数据集，并提出了动态因素影响学习方法。

Result: 模型在三个数据集上显著优于现有方法，并提供可解释的权重。

Conclusion: 该框架为临床干预提供了更精准和可解释的工具。

Abstract: Suicide is a critical global health issue that requires urgent attention.
Even though prior work has revealed valuable insights into detecting current
suicide risk on social media, little attention has been paid to developing
models that can predict subsequent suicide risk over time, limiting their
ability to capture rapid fluctuations in individuals' mental state transitions.
In addition, existing work ignores protective factors that play a crucial role
in suicide risk prediction, focusing predominantly on risk factors alone.
Protective factors such as social support and coping strategies can mitigate
suicide risk by moderating the impact of risk factors. Therefore, this study
proposes a novel framework for predicting subsequent suicide risk by jointly
learning the dynamic influence of both risk factors and protective factors on
users' suicide risk transitions. We propose a novel Protective Factor-Aware
Dataset, which is built from 12 years of Reddit posts along with comprehensive
annotations of suicide risk and both risk and protective factors. We also
introduce a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach that captures the
varying impact of risk and protective factors on suicide risk transitions,
recognizing that suicide risk fluctuates over time according to established
psychological theories. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that the proposed
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language
models across three datasets. In addition, the proposed Dynamic Factors
Influence Learning provides interpretable weights, helping clinicians better
understand suicidal patterns and enabling more targeted intervention
strategies.

TL;DR: GeLaCo是一种基于进化的LLM压缩方法，通过层折叠和模块相似性评估，高效探索压缩解空间，支持单目标和多目标优化，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）计算需求高，部署和使用受限，模型压缩是解决这一问题的关键。现有方法如结构化剪枝成本高且可能忽略更优解。

Method: GeLaCo采用进化方法，通过层折叠和基于种群的搜索，结合模块相似性适应度函数（注意力、前馈和隐藏状态表示），支持单目标和多目标压缩搜索。

Result: GeLaCo在困惑度和生成评估中优于现有方法，首次建立了压缩与质量之间的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: GeLaCo为LLM压缩提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，支持更灵活的压缩目标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a
large number of tasks, but face critical deployment and usage barriers due to
substantial computational requirements. Model compression methods, which aim to
reduce model size while preserving its capacity, are an important means to
mitigate these issues. Promising approaches along these lines, such as
structured pruning, typically require costly empirical search for optimal
variants and may run the risk of ignoring better solutions. In this work we
introduce GeLaCo, an evolutionary approach to LLM compression via layer
collapse. Our approach supports an efficient exploration of the compression
solution space via population-based search and a module-wise similarity fitness
function capturing attention, feed-forward, and hidden state representations.
GeLaCo also supports both single and multi-objective evolutionary compression
search, establishing the first Pareto frontier along compression and quality
axes. We evaluate GeLaCo solutions via both perplexity-based and generative
evaluations over foundational and instruction-tuned models, outperforming
state-of-the-art alternatives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）无法代表多样文化道德框架，尽管其语言能力强。模型在19种文化背景下与人类道德直觉存在显著差距，且模型规模增大并未改善文化代表性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI系统是否能真正代表人类多样化的道德价值观，而非简单地平均化。

Method: 应用道德基础问卷（Moral Foundations Questionnaire）在19种文化背景下比较LLMs与人类道德直觉的差异。

Result: LLMs系统性地同质化道德多样性，模型规模增大未显著提升文化代表性。

Conclusion: 当前AI对齐方法存在根本性局限，需开发更接地气的对齐目标和评估指标，以确保AI系统能代表多样化的人类价值观。

Abstract: Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across
them? Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs)
fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic
capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral
intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural
contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human
baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity.
Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural
representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as
synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental
limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment
beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific
moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and
evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather
than flattening the moral landscape.

Motivation: 直接使用原生ReFT方法在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，因为固定位置的表示对输出的影响不确定。

Method: CRFT通过信息流分析识别关键表示，并在低秩线性子空间中动态优化这些表示，同时冻结基础模型。

Result: 在八个算术和常识推理基准测试中验证了CRFT的有效性和效率，并在少样本设置中提升了16.4%的单次准确率。

Conclusion: CRFT展示了表示级优化在复杂推理任务中的潜力，为传统PEFT方法提供了轻量且强大的替代方案。

Abstract: Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly
improving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this
work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However,
directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at
the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these
fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe
that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical
representations. These representations either integrate significant information
from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through
layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final
output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential
to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we
propose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that
identifies and optimizes these critical representations through information
flow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework,
dynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace
while freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method
are validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning,
using LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts
effectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work
highlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT
reasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT
methods.

*Chen Su,Yuanhe Tian,Qinyu Liu,Jun Zhang,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LLMs和Transformer的混合架构，以融合语义和时间信息，提升时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在时间序列预测中表现不佳，而传统Transformer难以捕捉高级语义模式，因此需要结合两者优势。

Method: 设计了一种混合Transformer架构，融合LLM的语义表示和Transformer的时间动态信息。

Result: 实验证明该方法在基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合LLMs和Transformer，模型能够更准确地预测未来值。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies
to time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the
given historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge
learned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning
strategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and
semantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical
time series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to
achieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly
trained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn
high-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel
Transformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla
Transformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations
learned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series
Transformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the
representations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused
representation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic
variation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

*Khouloud Saadi,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于任务的特征蒸馏方法，无需引入新参数即可在不同隐藏层维度的师生模型间实现知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法假设师生模型隐藏层维度相同，限制了学生模型的灵活性；线性投影方法虽能解决此问题，但会引入额外参数并降低性能。

Method: 通过识别教师模型中与任务最相关的隐藏单元，直接将其激活蒸馏到学生模型，无需新参数。

Result: 在分类、指令跟随和摘要等任务上表现优于基线方法，性能提升达3%。

Conclusion: 该方法灵活且高效，能显著提升知识蒸馏性能，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) in general and feature distillation in particular
are promising techniques for reducing the high computational demand of large
language models (LLMs). However, traditional feature KD methods typically
assume that the teacher and the student share the same hidden size, limiting
the flexibility of the student's architecture. A common solution to this
problem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but
this introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and
often degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative
settings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based
feature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and
student models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any
new parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components
contribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies
the most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their
activations to the student. Our method is flexible and easily integrates with
other distillation frameworks. Empirical results show consistent improvements
over prior approaches across diverse tasks, including classification,
instruction-following, and summarization, achieving up to a 3\% performance
gain over the linear projection baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在辱骂性文本分类和转换中的有效性，以保留文本意图的同时去除不当内容。

Method: 使用LLMs识别并转换辱骂性文本（推文和评论），通过情感和语义分析评估原始与转换后文本。

Result: Groq的表现与其他模型差异显著，GPT-4o与DeepSeek-V3表现相似。

Conclusion: LLMs在辱骂性文本转换中具有潜力，但不同模型表现差异较大，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in natural language processing tasks, their effectiveness in the
classification and transformation of abusive text into non-abusive versions
remains an area for exploration. In this study, we aim to use LLMs to transform
abusive text (tweets and reviews) featuring hate speech and swear words into
non-abusive text, while retaining the intent of the text. We evaluate the
performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Gemini, GPT-4o, DeekSeek and
Groq, on their ability to identify abusive text. We them to transform and
obtain a text that is clean from abusive and inappropriate content but
maintains a similar level of sentiment and semantics, i.e. the transformed text
needs to maintain its message. Afterwards, we evaluate the raw and transformed
datasets with sentiment analysis and semantic analysis. Our results show Groq
provides vastly different results when compared with other LLMs. We have
identified similarities between GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.

Method: 开发了包含18,000多个多选题的Absher基准，涵盖六类任务，评估多种先进的大语言模型。

Result: 结果显示模型在需要文化推断或上下文理解的任务中存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 强调了方言感知训练和文化对齐评估方法的紧迫性，以提升大语言模型在阿拉伯语应用中的表现。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to Arabic NLP
applications, evaluating their understanding of regional dialects and cultural
nuances is essential, particularly in linguistically diverse settings like
Saudi Arabia. This paper introduces \texttt{Absher}, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to assess LLMs performance across major Saudi dialects.
\texttt{Absher} comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions spanning six
distinct categories: Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage,
Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition. These questions are derived
from a curated dataset of dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs sourced from
various regions of Saudi Arabia. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs,
including multilingual and Arabic-specific models. We also provide detailed
insights into their capabilities and limitations. Our results reveal notable
performance gaps, particularly in tasks requiring cultural inference or
contextual understanding. Our findings highlight the urgent need for
dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methodologies to
improve LLMs performance in real-world Arabic applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化提示工程方法主要针对简单任务和大型语言模型，而复杂任务和小型模型对提示设计更敏感，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 采用两阶段进化搜索：第一阶段使用语法引导的遗传编程合成提示创建程序；第二阶段通过局部搜索进一步优化性能。

Result: 在三个小型通用语言模型和四个领域特定任务中，该方法优于PromptWizard、OPRO和RL-Prompt等现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂任务和小型模型中表现优异，性能提升显著，且退化情况极少。

Abstract: Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained
large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous
solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using
the model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art
approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on
very large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that
require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount
of text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown
to be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose
an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation
consisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic
programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching
the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic,
dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. In the second phase,
local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing
programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance. Our approach
outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches,
PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose
LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks. We also illustrate several
examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance
degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model
combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NLP领域有所进步，但模型仍易受对抗攻击（如同义词替换）的影响，尤其是循环网络和现代状态空间模型（SSMs）的鲁棒性研究不足。

Method: 通过计算GBM，减少输入扰动对模型输出的影响，重点关注LSTM、S4和CNN三种架构。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在对抗鲁棒性上比现有基线提升高达8.8%，并在对抗防御中优于多种先进方法。

Conclusion: GBM方法有效提升了NLP模型的鲁棒性，填补了SSM（S4）鲁棒性研究的空白。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior
work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional
architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space
models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose
unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on
Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the
impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM
for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models
(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance
resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on
clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)
robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to
8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial
defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM

Motivation: 验证LLM是否能复制人类在语言学任务中的细微判断，以扩展研究规模和效率。

Method: 通过四项心理语言学实验（涉及情感意义、情绪语境中的动词选择等），比较人类与LLM的反应。

Result: 人类与LLM的反应高度相关（Spearman's rho = .73-.96），表明LLM可作为有效补充工具。

Conclusion: LLM在语言学研究中具有可信度和信息价值，能增强传统实验并支持假设生成。

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as reliable
analytical tools in linguistic research, focusing on the emergence of affective
meanings in temporal expressions involving manner-of-motion verbs. While LLMs
like GPT-4 have shown promise across a range of tasks, their ability to
replicate nuanced human judgements remains under scrutiny. We conducted four
psycholinguistic studies (on emergent meanings, valence shifts, verb choice in
emotional contexts, and sentence-emoji associations) first with human
participants and then replicated the same tasks using an LLM. Results across
all studies show a striking convergence between human and AI responses, with
statistical analyses (e.g., Spearman's rho = .73-.96) indicating strong
correlations in both rating patterns and categorical choices. While minor
divergences were observed in some cases, these did not alter the overall
interpretative outcomes. These findings offer compelling evidence that LLMs can
augment traditional human-based experimentation, enabling broader-scale studies
without compromising interpretative validity. This convergence not only
strengthens the empirical foundation of prior human-based findings but also
opens possibilities for hypothesis generation and data expansion through AI.
Ultimately, our study supports the use of LLMs as credible and informative
collaborators in linguistic inquiry.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层隐喻处理模型，将隐喻意义分为内容分析、概念融合和语用意三个层次，为计算系统提供了更丰富的隐喻解释框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻意义并非简单的概念映射，而是一个复杂的认知现象，需要多层次解释。现有方法难以全面捕捉隐喻的深度和语境敏感性。

Method: 提出三层模型：内容分析（标注基本概念元素）、概念融合（建模概念组合）、语用意（引入语用词汇捕捉意图和语境效果）。

Result: 模型为计算系统提供了更丰富、更认知基础的隐喻解释方法，支持更深层次和语境敏感的推理。

Conclusion: 通过统一多层框架，该模型为计算隐喻理解奠定了基础，超越了表面关联，实现了更深层次的意义表达。

Abstract: Metaphorical meaning is not a flat mapping between concepts, but a complex
cognitive phenomenon that integrates multiple levels of interpretation. In this
paper, we propose a stratified model of metaphor processing that treats meaning
as an onion: a multi-layered structure comprising (1) content analysis, (2)
conceptual blending, and (3) pragmatic intentionality. This three-dimensional
framework allows for a richer and more cognitively grounded approach to
metaphor interpretation in computational systems. At the first level, metaphors
are annotated through basic conceptual elements. At the second level, we model
conceptual combinations, linking components to emergent meanings. Finally, at
the third level, we introduce a pragmatic vocabulary to capture speaker intent,
communicative function, and contextual effects, aligning metaphor understanding
with pragmatic theories. By unifying these layers into a single formal
framework, our model lays the groundwork for computational methods capable of
representing metaphorical meaning beyond surface associations, toward deeper,
more context-sensitive reasoning.

Result: 发现LLMs能有效提取属性图（如分子图）的子结构，展示其在复杂模式提取中的能力。

Conclusion: 为序列Transformer处理图数据提供了新见解，展示了其在子结构提取任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) possess the
capability to solve graph reasoning tasks. Notably, even when graph structures
are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer
related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only
Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address
this, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner
mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input
queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis,
we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures
the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further
validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across
layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of
Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the
concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite
patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully
extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs.
Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers
perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.

Method: 结合Minecraft Dialogue Corpus的两种标注，构建新语料库，对比人类与LLMs在模糊性情况下的行为。

Result: 人类很少因指代模糊提问，而LLMs更多；人类更多因任务不确定性提问，而LLMs较少。推理能力可能提升LLMs提问频率和相关性。

Conclusion: LLMs的澄清问题能力与推理能力相关，但与人类行为差异显著。

Abstract: In this work we examine LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions in
task-oriented dialogues that follow the asynchronous
instruction-giver/instruction-follower format. We present a new corpus that
combines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for
reference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications
-- into a single common format providing the necessary information to
experiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this
corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification
questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We
find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing
clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans
and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential
ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce
more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task
uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is
predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with
different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase
question frequency and relevancy.

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative Applicant Tracking System (ATS) enhanced
by a novel Robotic process automation (RPA) framework or as further referred to
as MLAR. Traditional recruitment processes often encounter bottlenecks in
resume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource
constraints. MLAR addresses these challenges employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in three distinct layers: extracting key characteristics from job
postings in the first layer, parsing applicant resume to identify education,
experience, skills in the second layer, and similarity matching in the third
layer. These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to
identify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly
into existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and
candidate notifications. Extensive performance benchmarking shows that MLAR
outperforms the leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation
Anywhere, in high-volume resume-processing tasks. When processing 2,400
resumes, MLAR achieved an average processing time of 5.4 seconds per resume,
reducing processing time by approximately 16.9% compared to Automation Anywhere
and 17.1% compared to UiPath. These results highlight the potential of MLAR to

Result: LLaDA在困惑度和突发性上接近人类文本，导致检测器高假阴性率；LLaMA困惑度低但词汇保真度差。单一指标无法区分扩散输出与人类写作。

Conclusion: 需开发针对扩散模型的检测方法，如混合模型、扩散特定特征或鲁棒水印。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns
about reliably detecting AI-generated text. Stylometric metrics work well on
autoregressive (AR) outputs, but their effectiveness on diffusion-based models
is unknown. We present the first systematic comparison of diffusion-generated
text (LLaDA) and AR-generated text (LLaMA) using 2 000 samples. Perplexity,
burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that
LLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high
false-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower
perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to
separate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for
diffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models,
diffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking.

Motivation: 解决语言模型扩展时计算和内存需求高的问题，同时实现参数共享和自适应计算。

Method: MoR 通过共享层和轻量级路由器动态分配递归深度，选择性缓存键值对，并提出KV共享变体以减少预填充延迟。

Result: 在135M到1.7B参数范围内，MoR在相同训练FLOPs下显著降低验证困惑度，提高少样本准确率，并提升吞吐量。

Conclusion: MoR 是实现高质量大模型而不增加成本的有效路径。

Abstract: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying
computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive.
Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or
adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both
simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework
that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.
MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter
efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by
dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This
allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still
active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency
by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core
mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the
first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory
footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms
a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it
significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,
while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive
baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards
large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

Motivation: 探索LLM作为裁判在代码任务中的有效性，填补缺乏专用基准的空白。

Method: 引入CodeJudgeBench基准，评估26个LLM模型在代码生成、修复和单元测试生成任务中的表现。

Result: 思考型模型优于非思考型模型，但所有模型存在判断随机性和顺序敏感性。

Conclusion: LLM作为裁判在代码任务中表现不稳定，需优化提示策略以提高可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art
in various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also
serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by
other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking
different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.
However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its
effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of
dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a
benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge
models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and
unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge
models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform
non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even
relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially
trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still
exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise
judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can
substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests
written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in
performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and
consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal
prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise
comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining
comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved
judge performance.

TL;DR: REST框架通过同时测试多个问题，评估大型推理模型在压力下的表现，揭示现有基准测试的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法局限于单问题测试，无法反映真实世界的多上下文压力需求。

Method: 提出REST框架，同时暴露模型于多个问题，评估其上下文优先级分配、跨问题干扰抵抗和动态认知负载管理能力。

Result: 即使SOTA模型在压力测试下表现显著下降，REST显示出更强的区分能力。

Conclusion: REST是一种高效、未来兼容的评估范式，减少对人类标注的依赖，更贴近实际需求。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on
task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by
isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess
single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical
limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging
(e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual
creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate
models under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world
deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through
Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes
LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST
specifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority
allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load
management. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance
degradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger
discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance
differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under
single-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our
analysis: (1) the "overthinking trap" is a critical factor contributing to the
performance degradation; (2) the models trained with "long2short" technique
preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST,
outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a
cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects
real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human
annotation.

### [269] [OTAS: Open-vocabulary Token Alignment for Outdoor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08851)
*Simon Schwaiger,Stefan Thalhammer,Wilfried Wöber,Gerald Steinbauer-Wagner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OTAS是一种开放词汇的户外分割方法，通过从预训练视觉模型的输出令牌中提取语义结构，克服了现有方法的局限性，支持零样本运行和几何一致的特征场重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非结构化户外环境中，现有的视觉-语言映射方法依赖对象中心分割先验，常因语义模糊和边界不清而失败，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: OTAS通过聚类单视图和多视图中的语义相似结构，并将其与语言对齐，重建几何一致的特征场，支持开放词汇分割查询。

Result: OTAS在零样本条件下运行，速度达17 fps，在Off-Road Freespace Detection数据集上表现优于微调和开放词汇2D分割方法，在TartanAir上3D分割性能提升151%。

Conclusion: OTAS适用于机器人应用，代码和ROS节点将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Understanding open-world semantics is critical for robotic planning and
control, particularly in unstructured outdoor environments. Current
vision-language mapping approaches rely on object-centric segmentation priors,
which often fail outdoors due to semantic ambiguities and indistinct semantic
class boundaries. We propose OTAS - an Open-vocabulary Token Alignment method
for Outdoor Segmentation. OTAS overcomes the limitations of open-vocabulary
segmentation models by extracting semantic structure directly from the output
tokens of pretrained vision models. By clustering semantically similar
structures across single and multiple views and grounding them in language,
OTAS reconstructs a geometrically consistent feature field that supports
open-vocabulary segmentation queries. Our method operates zero-shot, without
scene-specific fine-tuning, and runs at up to ~17 fps. OTAS provides a minor
IoU improvement over fine-tuned and open-vocabulary 2D segmentation methods on
the Off-Road Freespace Detection dataset. Our model achieves up to a 151% IoU
improvement over open-vocabulary mapping methods in 3D segmentation on
TartanAir. Real-world reconstructions demonstrate OTAS' applicability to
robotic applications. The code and ROS node will be made publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: AirScape为空中代理提供了有效的空间想象能力，推动了具身智能的发展。

Abstract: How to enable robots to predict the outcomes of their own motion intentions
in three-dimensional space has been a fundamental problem in embodied
intelligence. To explore more general spatial imagination capabilities, here we
present AirScape, the first world model designed for six-degree-of-freedom
aerial agents. AirScape predicts future observation sequences based on current
visual inputs and motion intentions. Specifically, we construct an dataset for
aerial world model training and testing, which consists of 11k video-intention
pairs. This dataset includes first-person-view videos capturing diverse drone
actions across a wide range of scenarios, with over 1,000 hours spent
annotating the corresponding motion intentions. Then we develop a two-phase
training schedule to train a foundation model -- initially devoid of embodied
spatial knowledge -- into a world model that is controllable by motion
intentions and adheres to physical spatio-temporal constraints.

Conclusion: EGC-VMAP为城市级地图提供了一种可扩展、经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: High-precision vectorized maps are indispensable for autonomous driving, yet
traditional LiDAR-based creation is costly and slow, while single-vehicle
perception methods lack accuracy and robustness, particularly in adverse
conditions. This paper introduces EGC-VMAP, an end-to-end framework that
overcomes these limitations by generating accurate, city-scale vectorized maps
through the aggregation of data from crowdsourced vehicles. Unlike prior
approaches, EGC-VMAP directly fuses multi-vehicle, multi-temporal map elements
perceived onboard vehicles using a novel Trip-Aware Transformer architecture
within a unified learning process. Combined with hierarchical matching for
efficient training and a multi-objective loss, our method significantly
enhances map accuracy and structural robustness compared to single-vehicle
baselines. Validated on a large-scale, multi-city real-world dataset, EGC-VMAP
demonstrates superior performance, enabling a scalable, cost-effective solution
for city-wide mapping with a reported 90\% reduction in manual annotation
costs.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) semantic mapping of complex intersections poses
significant challenges for traditional vehicle-based approaches due to
occlusions and limited perspectives. This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR
fusion framework that leverages elevated intelligent roadside units (IRUs).
Additionally, we present RS-seq, a comprehensive dataset developed through the
systematic enhancement and annotation of the V2X-Seq dataset. RS-seq includes
precisely labelled camera imagery and LiDAR point clouds collected from
roadside installations, along with vectorized maps for seven intersections
annotated with detailed features such as lane dividers, pedestrian crossings,
and stop lines. This dataset facilitates the systematic investigation of
cross-modal complementarity for HD map generation using IRU data. The proposed
fusion framework employs a two-stage process that integrates modality-specific
feature extraction and cross-modal semantic integration, capitalizing on camera
high-resolution texture and precise geometric data from LiDAR. Quantitative
evaluations using the RS-seq dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach
consistently surpasses unimodal methods. Specifically, compared to unimodal
baselines evaluated on the RS-seq dataset, the multimodal approach improves the
mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation by 4\% over the
image-only results and 18\% over the point cloud-only results. This study
establishes a baseline methodology for IRU-based HD semantic mapping and
provides a valuable dataset for future research in infrastructure-assisted
autonomous driving systems.

Result: 开发了高效的强化学习框架，显著提升了机器人多指操作的灵巧性。

Conclusion: 通过改进探索方法和引入人类示范，为机器人灵巧操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dexterous intelligence -- the ability to perform complex interactions with
multi-fingered hands -- is a pinnacle of human physical intelligence and
emergent higher-order cognitive skills. However, contrary to Moravec's paradox,
dexterous intelligence in humans appears simple only superficially. Many
million years were spent co-evolving the human brain and hands including rich
tactile sensing. Achieving human-level dexterity with robotic hands has long
been a fundamental goal in robotics and represents a critical milestone toward
general embodied intelligence. In this pursuit, computational sensorimotor
learning has made significant progress, enabling feats such as arbitrary
in-hand object reorientation. However, we observe that achieving higher levels
of dexterity requires overcoming very fundamental limitations of computational
sensorimotor learning.
  I develop robot learning methods for highly dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation by directly addressing these limitations at their root cause.
Chiefly, through key studies, this disseration progressively builds an
effective framework for reinforcement learning of dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation skills. These methods adopt structured exploration, effectively
overcoming the limitations of random exploration in reinforcement learning. The
insights gained culminate in a highly effective reinforcement learning that
incorporates sampling-based planning for direct exploration. Additionally, this
thesis explores a new paradigm of using visuo-tactile human demonstrations for
dexterity, introducing corresponding imitation learning techniques.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合包装策略、结构稳定性验证和启发式规划的新框架，解决在线装箱问题中的结构稳定性和安全重新配置问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法在在线装箱问题中虽能提高体积利用率，但无法保证箱子的结构稳定性，且缺乏安全重新配置机制。

Method: 引入负载可承载凸多边形（LBCP）概念进行稳定性验证，并提出稳定重排规划（SRP）模块以安全重新配置箱子。

Result: 在标准OBPP基准测试中，LBCP验证高效且通用，SRP在节省重排成本方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业与物流中的自动化装箱提供了鲁棒且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The Online Bin Packing Problem (OBPP) is a sequential decision-making task in
which each item must be placed immediately upon arrival, with no knowledge of
future arrivals. Although recent deep-reinforcement-learning methods achieve
superior volume utilization compared with classical heuristics, the learned
policies cannot ensure the structural stability of the bin and lack mechanisms
for safely reconfiguring the bin when a new item cannot be placed directly. In
this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates packing policy with
structural stability validation and heuristic planning to overcome these
limitations. Specifically, we introduce the concept of Load Bearable Convex
Polygon (LBCP), which provides a computationally efficient way to identify
stable loading positions that guarantee no bin collapse. Additionally, we
present Stable Rearrangement Planning (SRP), a module that rearranges existing
items to accommodate new ones while maintaining overall stability. Extensive
experiments on standard OBPP benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and
generalizability of our LBCP-based stability validation, as well as the
superiority of SRP in finding the effort-saving rearrangement plans. Our method
offers a robust and practical solution for automated packing in real-world
industrial and logistics applications.

Method: 提出Tactile-VLA框架，结合视觉、语言、动作和触觉感知，采用混合力-位置控制器和触觉反馈推理模块。

Conclusion: Tactile-VLA成功将VLA模型的隐式知识扩展到物理交互领域，为通用机器人代理的发展提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable achievements,
driven by the rich implicit knowledge of their vision-language components.
However, achieving generalist robotic agents demands precise grounding into
physical interactions, especially in contact-rich scenarios where fine-grained
force control is essential. We advance VLAs' implicit knowledge beyond
identifying what to do, towards guiding how to physically interact with real
world. This paper introduces Tactile-VLA, a novel framework that deeply fuses
vision, language, action, and tactile sensing. This framework incorporates a
hybrid position-force controller to translate the model's intentions into
precise physical actions and a reasoning module that allows the robot to adapt
its strategy based on tactile feedback. Experiments demonstrate Tactile-VLA's
effectiveness and generalizability in three key aspects: (1) enabling
tactile-aware instruction following, (2) utilizing tactile-relevant
commonsense, and (3) facilitating adaptive tactile-involved reasoning. A key
finding is that the VLM's prior knowledge already contains semantic
understanding of physical interaction; by connecting it to the robot's tactile
sensors with only a few demonstrations, we can activate this prior knowledge to
achieve zero-shot generalization in contact-rich tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法能高效生成可解任务，为机器人训练提供丰富且语义可衡量的数据集。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for the procedural construction of multi-step
contact-rich manipulation tasks in robotics. Our generator takes as input
user-defined sets of atomic actions, objects, and spatial predicates and
outputs solvable tasks of a given length for the selected robotic environment.
The generator produces solvable tasks by constraining all possible
(nonsolvable) combinations by symbolic and physical validation. The symbolic
validation checks each generated sequence for logical and operational
consistency, and also the suitability of object-predicate relations. Physical
validation checks whether tasks can be solved in the selected robotic
environment. Only the tasks that passed both validators are retained. The
output from the generator can be directly interfaced with any existing
framework for training robotic manipulation tasks, or it can be stored as a
dataset of curated robotic tasks with detailed information about each task.
This is beneficial for RL training as there are dense reward functions and
initial and goal states paired with each subgoal. It allows the user to measure
the semantic similarity of all generated tasks. We tested our generator on
sequences of up to 15 actions resulting in millions of unique solvable
multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法无需基础设施或人工调参，开源且性能优越，适用于非重叠传感器配置。

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs is crucial for improving
the foundational performance of three-dimensional (3D) map reconstruction
systems. This paper presents a novel targetless extrinsic calibration framework
for multi-LiDAR systems that does not rely on overlapping fields of view or
precise initial parameter estimates. Unlike conventional calibration methods
that require manual annotations or specific reference patterns, our approach
introduces a unified optimization framework by integrating LiDAR bundle
adjustment (LBA) optimization with robust iterative refinement. The proposed
method constructs an accurate reference point cloud map via continuous scanning
from the target LiDAR and sliding-window LiDAR bundle adjustment, while
formulating extrinsic calibration as a joint LBA optimization problem. This
method effectively mitigates cumulative mapping errors and achieves
outlier-resistant parameter estimation through an adaptive weighting mechanism.
Extensive evaluations in both the CARLA simulation environment and real-world
scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art calibration
techniques in both accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that for
non-overlapping sensor configurations, our framework achieves an average
translational error of 5 mm and a rotational error of 0.2{\deg}, with an
initial error tolerance of up to 0.4 m/30{\deg}. Moreover, the calibration
process operates without specialized infrastructure or manual parameter tuning.

We propose HZ-MP, an informed Hybrid Zonotope-based Motion Planner, as an
alternative approach that decomposes the obstacle-free space and performs
low-dimensional face sampling guided by an ellipsotope heuristic, enabling
focused exploration along promising transit regions. This structured
exploration eliminates the excessive, unreachable sampling that degrades
existing informed planners such as AIT* and EIT* in narrow gaps or boxed-goal
scenarios. We prove that HZ-MP is probabilistically complete and asymptotically
optimal. It converges to near-optimal trajectories in finite time and scales to
high-dimensional cluttered scenes.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning,
faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy
computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and
traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of
perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random
Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight
linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space,
followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel
Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this
process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this
map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner)
framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance
Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to
refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a
closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP
model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive
navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form
gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in
diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in
time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe
navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster
community collaboration.

Motivation: 卫星定位和摄像头在许多环境中可用性有限，导致依赖惯性传感器时精度快速下降。需要一种不依赖地面接触的漂移恢复方法。

Method: 引入控制零速度更新（C-ZUPT）方法，通过不确定性阈值识别准静态平衡，为估计滤波器提供精确速度更新。

Result: C-ZUPT显著减少了惯性漂移和控制能耗，增强了导航稳定性，延长了飞行时间。

Conclusion: C-ZUPT方法有效解决了空中系统的漂移问题，提高了能源效率和飞行稳定性。

Abstract: Autonomous systems across diverse domains have underscored the need for
drift-resilient state estimation. Although satellite-based positioning and
cameras are widely used, they often suffer from limited availability in many
environments. As a result, positioning must rely solely on inertial sensors,
leading to rapid accuracy degradation over time due to sensor biases and noise.
To counteract this, alternative update sources-referred to as information
aiding-serve as anchors of certainty. Among these, the zero-velocity update
(ZUPT) is particularly effective in providing accurate corrections during
stationary intervals, though it is restricted to surface-bound platforms. This
work introduces a controlled ZUPT (C-ZUPT) approach for aerial navigation and
control, independent of surface contact. By defining an uncertainty threshold,
C-ZUPT identifies quasi-static equilibria to deliver precise velocity updates
to the estimation filter. Extensive validation confirms that these
opportunistic, high-quality updates significantly reduce inertial drift and
control effort. As a result, C-ZUPT mitigates filter divergence and enhances
navigation stability, enabling more energy-efficient hovering and substantially
extending sustained flight-key advantages for resource-constrained aerial
systems.

Abstract: Learning from demonstration has proven effective in robotics for acquiring
natural behaviors, such as stylistic motions and lifelike agility, particularly
when explicitly defining style-oriented reward functions is challenging.
Synthesizing stylistic motions for real-world tasks usually requires balancing
task performance and imitation quality. Existing methods generally depend on
expert demonstrations closely aligned with task objectives. However, practical
demonstrations are often incomplete or unrealistic, causing current methods to
boost style at the expense of task performance. To address this issue, we
propose formulating the problem as a constrained Markov Decision Process
(CMDP). Specifically, we optimize a style-imitation objective with constraints
to maintain near-optimal task performance. We introduce an adaptively
adjustable Lagrangian multiplier to guide the agent to imitate demonstrations
selectively, capturing stylistic nuances without compromising task performance.
We validate our approach across multiple robotic platforms and tasks,
demonstrating both robust task performance and high-fidelity style learning. On
ANYmal-D hardware we show a 14.5% drop in mechanical energy and a more agile
gait pattern, showcasing real-world benefits.

framework employs classifier-free guidance training and integrates local

and continuously refines them through potential field-based adaptation,
demonstrating effective performance in pursuit-evasion scenarios with partial

Conclusion: 研究为多旋翼系统的协调和控制提供了物理基础策略，提升了密集环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Flying multiple quadrotors in close proximity presents a significant
challenge due to complex aerodynamic interactions, particularly downwash
effects that are known to destabilize vehicles and degrade performance.
Traditionally, multi-quadrotor systems rely on conservative strategies, such as
collision avoidance zones around the robot volume, to circumvent this effect.
This restricts their capabilities by requiring a large volume for the operation
of a multi-quadrotor system, limiting their applicability in dense
environments. This work provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of the
downwash effect, with a focus on characterizing, analyzing, and understanding
forces, moments, and velocities in both single and multi-quadrotor
configurations. We use measurements of forces and torques to characterize
vehicle interactions, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) to quantify the
spatial features of the downwash wake for a single quadrotor and an interacting
pair of quadrotors. This data can be used to inform physics-based strategies
for coordination, leverage downwash for optimized formations, expand the
envelope of operation, and improve the robustness of multi-quadrotor control.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have emerged as versatile platforms, driving
the demand for accurate modeling to support developmental testing. This paper
proposes data-driven modeling software for UAV. Emphasizes the utilization of
cost-effective sensors to obtain orientation and location data subsequently
processed through the application of data filtering algorithms and sensor
fusion techniques to improve the data quality to make a precise model
visualization on the software. UAV's orientation is obtained using processed
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data and represented using Quaternion
Representation to avoid the gimbal lock problem. The UAV's location is
determined by combining data from the Global Positioning System (GPS), which
provides stable geographic coordinates but slower data update frequency, and
the accelerometer, which has higher data update frequency but integrating it to
get position data is unstable due to its accumulative error. By combining data
from these two sensors, the software is able to calculate and continuously
update the UAV's real-time position during its flight operations. The result
shows that the software effectively renders UAV orientation and position with
high degree of accuracy and fluidity

Conclusion: mmE-Loc系统通过多模态融合和优化模块，实现了无人机精准降落的高效解决方案。

Abstract: For precise, efficient, and safe drone landings, ground platforms should
real-time, accurately locate descending drones and guide them to designated
spots. While mmWave sensing combined with cameras improves localization
accuracy, lower sampling frequency of traditional frame cameras compared to
mmWave radar creates bottlenecks in system throughput. In this work, we upgrade
traditional frame camera with event camera, a novel sensor that harmonizes in
sampling frequency with mmWave radar within ground platform setup, and
introduce mmE-Loc, a high-precision, low-latency ground localization system
designed for precise drone landings. To fully exploit the \textit{temporal
consistency} and \textit{spatial complementarity} between these two modalities,
we propose two innovative modules: \textit{(i)} the Consistency-instructed
Collaborative Tracking module, which further leverages the drone's physical
knowledge of periodic micro-motions and structure for accurate measurements
extraction, and \textit{(ii)} the Graph-informed Adaptive Joint Optimization
module, which integrates drone motion information for efficient sensor fusion
and drone localization. Real-world experiments conducted in landing scenarios
with a drone delivery company demonstrate that mmE-Loc significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and latency.

Conclusion: TruckV2X填补了重型车辆协同感知数据集的空白，为未来研究提供了基准和方向。

Abstract: Autonomous trucking offers significant benefits, such as improved safety and
reduced costs, but faces unique perception challenges due to trucks' large size
and dynamic trailer movements. These challenges include extensive blind spots
and occlusions that hinder the truck's perception and the capabilities of other
road users. To address these limitations, cooperative perception emerges as a
promising solution. However, existing datasets predominantly feature light
vehicle interactions or lack multi-agent configurations for heavy-duty vehicle
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce TruckV2X, the first large-scale
truck-centered cooperative perception dataset featuring multi-modal sensing
(LiDAR and cameras) and multi-agent cooperation (tractors, trailers, CAVs, and
RSUs). We further investigate how trucks influence collaborative perception
needs, establishing performance benchmarks while suggesting research priorities
for heavy vehicle perception. The dataset provides a foundation for developing
cooperative perception systems with enhanced occlusion handling capabilities,
and accelerates the deployment of multi-agent autonomous trucking systems. The

Conclusion: Plan-MAE可作为基于学习的运动规划器的重要预训练步骤，显著提升自动驾驶车辆的轨迹规划能力。

Abstract: Predicting the future of surrounding agents and accordingly planning a safe,
goal-directed trajectory are crucial for automated vehicles. Current methods
typically rely on imitation learning to optimize metrics against the ground
truth, often overlooking how scene understanding could enable more holistic
trajectories. In this paper, we propose Plan-MAE, a unified pretraining
framework for prediction and planning that capitalizes on masked autoencoders.
Plan-MAE fuses critical contextual understanding via three dedicated tasks:
reconstructing masked road networks to learn spatial correlations, agent
trajectories to model social interactions, and navigation routes to capture
destination intents. To further align vehicle dynamics and safety constraints,
we incorporate a local sub-planning task predicting the ego-vehicle's near-term
trajectory segment conditioned on earlier segment. This pretrained model is
subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks to jointly generate the prediction
and planning trajectories. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that
Plan-MAE outperforms current methods on the planning metrics by a large margin
and can serve as an important pre-training step for learning-based motion
planner.

Conclusion: 论文首次揭示了神经元膜泄漏对SNN处理激光雷达数据的重要性，并开源了数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Using neuromorphic computing for robotics applications has gained much
attention in recent year due to the remarkable ability of Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) for high-precision yet low memory and compute complexity
inference when implemented in neuromorphic hardware. This ability makes SNNs
well-suited for autonomous robot applications (such as in drones and rovers)
where battery resources and payload are typically limited. Within this context,
this paper studies the use of SNNs for performing direct robot navigation and
obstacle avoidance from LIDAR data. A custom robot platform equipped with a
LIDAR is set up for collecting a labeled dataset of LIDAR sensing data together
with the human-operated robot control commands used for obstacle avoidance.
Crucially, this paper provides what is, to the best of our knowledge, a first
focused study about the importance of neuron membrane leakage on the SNN
precision when processing LIDAR data for obstacle avoidance. It is shown that
by carefully tuning the membrane potential leakage constant of the spiking
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons used within our SNN, it is possible to
achieve on-par robot control precision compared to the use of a non-spiking
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, the LIDAR dataset collected during
this work is released as open-source with the hope of benefiting future
research.

Conclusion: IteraOptiRacing策略在自动驾驶赛车中表现出色，能够生成无碰撞且时间最优的轨迹。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified planning-control strategy for competing with
other racing cars called IteraOptiRacing in autonomous racing environments.
This unified strategy is proposed based on Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator
for Iterative Tasks (i2LQR), which can improve lap time performance in the
presence of surrounding racing obstacles. By iteratively using the ego car's
historical data, both obstacle avoidance for multiple moving cars and time cost
optimization are considered in this unified strategy, resulting in
collision-free and time-optimal generated trajectories. The algorithm's
constant low computation burden and suitability for parallel computing enable
real-time operation in competitive racing scenarios. To validate its
performance, simulations in a high-fidelity simulator are conducted with
multiple randomly generated dynamic agents on the track. Results show that the
proposed strategy outperforms existing methods across all randomly generated
autonomous racing scenarios, enabling enhanced maneuvering for the ego racing
car.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蚂蚁仅需少量感官输入和学习行走即可实现稳健的视觉归巢，这启发了自主导航的生物仿生解决方案。

Method: 通过四个渐进实验验证了角路径积分（PI）信号的符号是否可以将全景视图分类为“目标在左”和“目标在右”记忆库，从而实现自然户外环境中的稳健归巢。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实世界中实现了类似蚂蚁的精确归巢行为，且仅依赖视觉输入，资源占用极低。

Conclusion: 该系统为自主视觉归巢提供了一种生物基础且资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few
learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While
Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have
not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world
implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a
compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path
integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during
learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the
right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We
validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation
showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled
learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks
using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal
behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to
control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and
functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite
relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with
32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a
biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual
homing.

Result: 在MetaDrive仿真环境中验证了框架的有效性，成功处理了复杂交通场景中的不确定性预测。

Conclusion: 该框架在多模态预测和主动探测方面表现出色，适用于现实世界的自主导航挑战。

Abstract: Navigation in dynamic environments requires autonomous systems to reason
about uncertainties in the behavior of other agents. In this paper, we
introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal
predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We
develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction
uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a
Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a
closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical
tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing
mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of
behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal
uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation
scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that
our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios
with uncertain predictions. Additionally, our framework shows robust
performance across diverse traffic agent behavior models, indicating its broad
applicability to real-world autonomous navigation challenges. Code and videos

Conclusion: MRMEL框架在复杂多变的交通环境中表现出色，为自动驾驶车辆的交通控制提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, with their
applications now extending beyond just a mode of transportation to serving as
mobile actuators of a traffic flow to control flow dynamics. This contrasts
with traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is
referred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective
Lagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic
scenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are
highly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such
diverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint
complexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among
participants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict
physical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce
Multi-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for
Lagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with
a learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic
scenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement
learning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a
residual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable
nominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic
scenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case
study in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas
Fort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios.
The results show that MRMEL consistently yields superior performance-achieving
an additional 4%-9% reduction in aggregate vehicle emissions relative to the
strongest baseline in each setting.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆（AVs）需要与人类驾驶车辆（HVs）在异构交通环境中有效协作，但现有换道框架忽视了HVs的动态信任水平，导致行为预测不准确。

Method: 提出TGLD框架，包括多车辆联盟博弈建模、实时信任评估方法，以及考虑社会兼容性目标的换道策略优化。

Result: 实验表明，AVs能根据HVs的信任水平和驾驶风格调整策略，显著提高换道效率并确保安全。

Conclusion: TGLD框架通过信任机制实现了透明、自适应的AV-HV交互，为异构交通环境中的协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated vehicles (AVs) face a critical need to adopt socially compatible
behaviors and cooperate effectively with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in
heterogeneous traffic environment. However, most existing lane-changing
frameworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to
accurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study
proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework.
First, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully
cooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs
informed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust
evaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during
lane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate
cooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered
by minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the
predictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and
context-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment
conducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach.
Results show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different
HVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism
significantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and
contributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on robotic grasping provide valuable insights into
evaluating and improving the robustness of these systems. Unlike studies that
focus solely on neural network predictions while overlooking the physical
principles of grasping, this paper introduces AdvGrasp, a framework for
adversarial attacks on robotic grasping from a physical perspective.
Specifically, AdvGrasp targets two core aspects: lift capability, which
evaluates the ability to lift objects against gravity, and grasp stability,
which assesses resistance to external disturbances. By deforming the object's
shape to increase gravitational torque and reduce stability margin in the
wrench space, our method systematically degrades these two key grasping
metrics, generating adversarial objects that compromise grasp performance.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios validate the effectiveness of
AdvGrasp, while real-world validations demonstrate its robustness and practical
applicability

Conclusion: REACT框架显著提升了水下检查任务的安全性和效率，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Inspection of complex underwater structures with tethered underwater vehicles
is often hindered by the risk of tether entanglement. We propose REACT
(real-time entanglement-aware coverage path planning for tethered underwater
vehicles), a framework designed to overcome this limitation. REACT comprises a
fast geometry-based tether model using the signed distance field (SDF) map for
accurate, real-time simulation of taut tether configurations around arbitrary
structures in 3D. This model enables an efficient online replanning strategy by
enforcing a maximum tether length constraint, thereby actively preventing
entanglement. By integrating REACT into a coverage path planning framework, we
achieve safe and optimal inspection paths, previously challenging due to tether
constraints. The complete REACT framework's efficacy is validated in a pipe
inspection scenario, demonstrating safe, entanglement-free navigation and
full-coverage inspection. Simulation results show that REACT achieves complete
coverage while maintaining tether constraints and completing the total mission
20% faster than conventional planners, despite a longer inspection time due to
proactive avoidance of entanglement that eliminates extensive post-mission
disentanglement. Real-world experiments confirm these benefits, where REACT
completes the full mission, while the baseline planner fails due to physical
tether entanglement.

Abstract: Safe navigation within a workspace is a fundamental skill for autonomous
robots to accomplish more complex tasks. Harmonic potentials are artificial
potential fields that are analytical, globally convergent and provably free of
local minima. Thus, it has been widely used for generating safe and reliable
robot navigation control policies. However, most existing methods do not allow
customization of the harmonic potential fields nor the resulting paths,
particularly regarding their topological properties. In this paper, we propose
a novel method that automatically finds homotopy classes of paths that can be
generated by valid harmonic potential fields. The considered complex workspaces
can be as general as forest worlds consisting of numerous overlapping
star-obstacles. The method is based on a hybrid optimization algorithm that
searches over homotopy classes, selects the structure of each tree-of-stars
within the forest, and optimizes over the continuous weight parameters for each
purged tree via the projected gradient descent. The key insight is to transform
the forest world to the unbounded point world via proper diffeomorphic
transformations. It not only facilitates a simpler design of the
multi-directional D-signature between non-homotopic paths, but also retain the
safety and convergence properties. Extensive simulations and hardware
experiments are conducted for non-trivial scenarios, where the navigation
potentials are customized for desired homotopic properties. Project page:

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于导航任务，还可用于MPC中实现逻辑或语言约束。

Abstract: In practice, navigation of mobile robots in confined environments is often
done using a spatially discrete cost-map to represent obstacles. Path following
is a typical use case for model predictive control (MPC), but formulating
constraints for obstacle avoidance is challenging in this case. Typically the
cost and constraints of an MPC problem are defined as closed-form functions and
typical solvers work best with continuously differentiable functions. This is
contrary to spatially discrete occupancy grid maps, in which a grid's value
defines the cost associated with occupancy. This paper presents a way to
overcome this compatibility issue by re-formulating occupancy grid maps to
continuously differentiable functions to be embedded into the MPC scheme as
constraints. Each obstacle is defined as a polygon -- an intersection of
half-spaces. Any half-space is a linear inequality representing one edge of a
polygon. Using AND and OR operators, the combined set of all obstacles and
therefore the obstacle avoidance constraints can be described. The key
contribution of this paper is the use of fuzzy logic to re-formulate such
constraints that include logical operators as inequality constraints which are
compatible with standard MPC formulation. The resulting MPC-based trajectory
planner is successfully tested in simulation. This concept is also applicable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉对人类和机器人至关重要，尤其在灵巧操作、材料识别和视觉遮挡场景中。Octopi-1.5旨在提升触觉模型的性能和应用范围。

Method: Octopi-1.5结合多部位触觉信号处理和RAG模块，通过TMI手持触觉接口（配备GelSight和TAC-02传感器）实现交互。

Conclusion: Octopi-1.5展示了视觉-触觉-语言模型的进展，同时揭示了其局限性，推动了该领域的研究兴趣。

Abstract: Touch is recognized as a vital sense for humans and an equally important
modality for robots, especially for dexterous manipulation, material
identification, and scenarios involving visual occlusion. Building upon very
recent work in touch foundation models, this demonstration will feature
Octopi-1.5, our latest visual-tactile-language model. Compared to its
predecessor, Octopi-1.5 introduces the ability to process tactile signals from
multiple object parts and employs a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
module to improve performance on tasks and potentially learn new objects
on-the-fly. The system can be experienced live through a new handheld
tactile-enabled interface, the TMI, equipped with GelSight and TAC-02 tactile
sensors. This convenient and accessible setup allows users to interact with
Octopi-1.5 without requiring a robot. During the demonstration, we will
showcase Octopi-1.5 solving tactile inference tasks by leveraging tactile
inputs and commonsense knowledge. For example, in a Guessing Game, Octopi-1.5
will identify objects being grasped and respond to follow-up queries about how
to handle it (e.g., recommending careful handling for soft fruits). We also
plan to demonstrate Octopi-1.5's RAG capabilities by teaching it new items.
With live interactions, this demonstration aims to highlight both the progress
and limitations of VTLMs such as Octopi-1.5 and to foster further interest in
this exciting field. Code for Octopi-1.5 and design files for the TMI gripper
are available at https://github.com/clear-nus/octopi-1.5.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for
addressing complex control problems, particularly those involving underactuated
robotic systems. However, in some cases, policies may require refinement to
achieve optimal performance and robustness aligned with specific task
objectives. In this paper, we propose an approach for fine-tuning Deep RL
policies using Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to enhance control performance for
underactuated robots. Our method involves initially training an RL agent with
Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) using a surrogate reward function designed to
approximate complex specific scoring metrics. We subsequently refine this
learned policy through a zero-order optimization step employing the Separable
Natural Evolution Strategy (SNES), directly targeting the original score.
Experimental evaluations conducted in the context of the 2nd AI Olympics with
RealAIGym at IROS 2024 demonstrate that our evolutionary fine-tuning
significantly improves agent performance while maintaining high robustness. The
resulting controllers outperform established baselines, achieving competitive
scores for the competition tasks.

Abstract: This research introduces MP-RBFN, a novel formulation leveraging Radial Basis
Function Networks for efficiently learning Motion Primitives derived from
optimal control problems for autonomous driving. While traditional motion
planning approaches based on optimization are highly accurate, they are often
computationally prohibitive. In contrast, sampling-based methods demonstrate
high performance but impose constraints on the geometric shape of trajectories.
MP-RBFN combines the strengths of both by coupling the high-fidelity trajectory
generation of sampling-based methods with an accurate description of vehicle
dynamics. Empirical results show compelling performance compared to previous
methods, achieving a precise description of motion primitives at low inference
times. MP-RBFN yields a seven times higher accuracy in generating optimized
motion primitives compared to existing semi-analytic approaches. We demonstrate
the practical applicability of MP-RBFN for motion planning by integrating the
method into a sampling-based trajectory planner. MP-RBFN is available as
open-source software at https://github.com/TUM-AVS/RBFN-Motion-Primitives.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of foundation models, particularly Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), has introduced a transformative
paradigm in robotics. These models offer powerful capabilities in semantic
understanding, high-level reasoning, and cross-modal generalization, enabling
significant advances in perception, planning, control, and human-robot
interaction. This critical review provides a structured synthesis of recent
developments, categorizing applications across simulation-driven design,
open-world execution, sim-to-real transfer, and adaptable robotics. Unlike
existing surveys that emphasize isolated capabilities, this work highlights
integrated, system-level strategies and evaluates their practical feasibility
in real-world environments. Key enabling trends such as procedural scene
generation, policy generalization, and multimodal reasoning are discussed
alongside core bottlenecks, including limited embodiment, lack of multimodal

paper identifies both the architectural strengths and critical limitations of
foundation model-based robotics, highlighting open challenges in real-time

roadmap for future research aimed at bridging semantic reasoning and physical
intelligence through more robust, interpretable, and embodied models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for whole-body torque control of
humanoid robots without joint torque sensors, designed for systems with
electric motors and high-ratio harmonic drives. The approach integrates
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for friction modeling and Unscented
Kalman Filtering (UKF) for joint torque estimation, within a real-time torque
control architecture. PINNs estimate nonlinear static and dynamic friction from
joint and motor velocity readings, capturing effects like motor actuation
without joint movement. The UKF utilizes PINN-based friction estimates as
direct measurement inputs, improving torque estimation robustness. Experimental
validation on the ergoCub humanoid robot demonstrates improved torque tracking
accuracy, enhanced energy efficiency, and superior disturbance rejection
compared to the state-of-the-art Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA), using
a dynamic balancing experiment. The framework's scalability is shown by
consistent performance across robots with similar hardware but different
friction characteristics, without re-identification. Furthermore, a comparative
analysis with position control highlights the advantages of the proposed torque
control approach. The results establish the method as a scalable and practical
solution for sensorless torque control in humanoid robots, ensuring torque

Motivation: 提高人机协作中意图推断的准确性，避免冲突并保持人类控制。

Method: GUIDER采用双阶段方法：导航阶段结合控制器速度和占用网格，操作阶段结合显著性检测和几何可行性测试。

Result: 在25次试验中，导航稳定性达93-100%，操作稳定性达94-100%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GUIDER在移动操作任务中显著提升了意图推断能力。

Abstract: Accurate inference of human intent enables human-robot collaboration without
constraining human control or causing conflicts between humans and robots. We
present GUIDER (Global User Intent Dual-phase Estimation for Robots), a
probabilistic framework that enables a robot to estimate the intent of human
operators. GUIDER maintains two coupled belief layers, one tracking navigation
goals and the other manipulation goals. In the Navigation phase, a Synergy Map
blends controller velocity with an occupancy grid to rank interaction areas.
Upon arrival at a goal, an autonomous multi-view scan builds a local 3D cloud.
The Manipulation phase combines U2Net saliency, FastSAM instance saliency, and
three geometric grasp-feasibility tests, with an end-effector kinematics-aware
update rule that evolves object probabilities in real-time. GUIDER can
recognize areas and objects of intent without predefined goals. We evaluated
GUIDER on 25 trials (five participants x five task variants) in Isaac Sim, and
compared it with two baselines, one for navigation and one for manipulation.
Across the 25 trials, GUIDER achieved a median stability of 93-100% during
navigation, compared with 60-100% for the BOIR baseline, with an improvement of
39.5% in a redirection scenario (T5). During manipulation, stability reached
94-100% (versus 69-100% for Trajectron), with a 31.4% difference in a
redirection task (T3). In geometry-constrained trials (manipulation), GUIDER
recognized the object intent three times earlier than Trajectron (median
remaining time to confident prediction 23.6 s vs 7.8 s). These results validate
our dual-phase framework and show improvements in intent inference in both
phases of mobile manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Developing robust locomotion controllers for bipedal robots with closed
kinematic chains presents unique challenges, particularly since most
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches simplify these parallel mechanisms into
serial models during training. We demonstrate that this simplification
significantly impairs sim-to-real transfer by failing to capture essential
aspects such as joint coupling, friction dynamics, and motor-space control
characteristics. In this work, we present an RL framework that explicitly
incorporates closed-chain dynamics and validate it on our custom-built robot
TopA. Our approach enhances policy robustness through symmetry-aware loss
functions, adversarial training, and targeted network regularization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our integrated approach achieves stable
locomotion across diverse terrains, significantly outperforming methods based
on simplified kinematic models.

Abstract: Visual coverage path planning with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires
agents to strategically coordinate UAV motion and camera control to maximize
coverage, minimize redundancy, and maintain battery efficiency. Traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods rely on environment-specific reward
formulations that lack semantic adaptability. This study proposes
Prompt-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL), a novel approach that integrates
the zero-shot reasoning ability and in-context learning capability of large
language models with curiosity-driven RL. PIRL leverages semantic feedback from
an LLM, GPT-3.5, to dynamically shape the reward function of the Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) RL policy guiding the agent in position and camera
adjustments for optimal visual coverage. The PIRL agent is trained using OpenAI
Gym and evaluated in various environments. Furthermore, the sim-to-real-like
ability and zero-shot generalization of the agent are tested by operating the
agent in Webots simulator which introduces realistic physical dynamics. Results
show that PIRL outperforms multiple learning-based baselines such as PPO with
static rewards, PPO with exploratory weight initialization, imitation learning,
and an LLM-only controller. Across different environments, PIRL outperforms the
best-performing baseline by achieving up to 14% higher visual coverage in
OpenAI Gym and 27% higher in Webots, up to 25% higher battery efficiency, and
up to 18\% lower redundancy, depending on the environment. The results
highlight the effectiveness of LLM-guided reward shaping in complex spatial
exploration tasks and suggest a promising direction for integrating natural
language priors into RL for robotics.

Abstract: Optimization has been widely used to generate smooth trajectories for motion
planning. However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when
dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel
computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently
solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this
paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the
Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which
decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in
parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per
iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that
integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the
optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality
constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness.
Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving
over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on
modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and
show high performance with thousands of segments.

Conclusion: 雷达在不同天气条件下的鲁棒性使其成为姿态估计系统的有价值组件，特别是在视觉传感器性能下降时。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems are highly dependent on sensors like cameras,
LiDAR, and inertial measurement units (IMU) to perceive the environment and
estimate their motion. Among these sensors, perception-based sensors are not
protected from harsh weather and technical failures. Although existing methods
show robustness against common technical issues like rotational misalignment
and disconnection, they often degrade when faced with dynamic environmental
factors like weather conditions. To address these problems, this research
introduces a novel deep learning-based motion estimator that integrates visual,
inertial, and millimeter-wave radar data, utilizing each sensor strengths to
improve odometry estimation accuracy and reliability under adverse
environmental conditions such as snow, rain, and varying light. The proposed
model uses advanced sensor fusion techniques that dynamically adjust the
contributions of each sensor based on the current environmental condition, with
radar compensating for visual sensor limitations in poor visibility. This work
explores recent advancements in radar-based odometry and highlights that radar
robustness in different weather conditions makes it a valuable component for
pose estimation systems, specifically when visual sensors are degraded.
Experimental results, conducted on the Boreas dataset, showcase the robustness
and effectiveness of the model in both clear and degraded environments.

Abstract: While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret
scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems
typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based
interaction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to
driver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a
modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large
language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling
to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS
supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing
natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented
in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes
confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model
fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and
revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased
latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated
dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining
conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support
the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.

consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs
3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action
trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning
the interval-averaged velocity via the MeanFlow Identity, our policy avoids any
additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical
ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1
further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while
retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because
subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in
few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state
embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference.
We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in
real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average
task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its
average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster
than FlowPolicy. Our code is available at https://mp1-2254.github.io/.

### [314] [Counterfactual optimization for fault prevention in complex wind energy systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08849)
*Emilio Carrizosa,Martina Fischetti,Roshell Haaker,Juan Miguel Morales*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的方法，不仅检测系统异常，还优化控制策略以最小化恢复成本，应用于风电变压器系统，年节省约300万欧元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅检测异常，未提供恢复策略。本文旨在填补这一空白，优化系统恢复的最小调整。

Method: 将问题建模为反事实优化问题，利用数学模型在系统约束下找到最优解。

Result: 在风电变压器系统中，方法适应性强，年节省约300万欧元。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅拓展了反事实优化的应用领域，还为复杂系统的恢复策略提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine Learning models are increasingly used in businesses to detect faults
and anomalies in complex systems. In this work, we take this approach a step
further: beyond merely detecting anomalies, we aim to identify the optimal
control strategy that restores the system to a safe state with minimal
disruption. We frame this challenge as a counterfactual problem: given a
Machine Learning model that classifies system states as either good or
anomalous, our goal is to determine the minimal adjustment to the system's
control variables (i.e., its current status) that is necessary to return it to
the good state. To achieve this, we leverage a mathematical model that finds
the optimal counterfactual solution while respecting system specific
constraints. Notably, most counterfactual analysis in the literature focuses on
individual cases where a person seeks to alter their status relative to a
decision made by a classifier, such as for loan approval or medical diagnosis.
Our work addresses a fundamentally different challenge: optimizing
counterfactuals for a complex energy system, specifically an offshore wind
turbine oil type transformer. This application not only advances counterfactual
optimization in a new domain but also opens avenues for broader research in
this area. Our tests on real world data provided by our industrial partner show
that our methodology easily adapts to user preferences and brings savings in
the order of 3 million euros per year in a typical farm.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别不确定系统中的概率实际原因，并具有较高的可扩展性。

Abstract: Identifying the actual cause of events in engineered systems is a fundamental
challenge in system analysis. Finding such causes becomes more challenging in
the presence of noise and uncertainty in real-world systems. In this paper, we
adopt the notion of probabilistic actual causality by Fenton-Glynn, which is a
probabilistic extension of Halpern and Pearl's actual causality, and propose a
novel method to formally reason about causal effect of events in systems
subject to uncertainty. We (1) formulate the discovery of probabilistic actual
causes in computing systems as an SMT problem, and (2) address the scalability
challenges by introducing an abstraction-refinement technique that
significantly improves efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach through three case studies, identifying probabilistic causes of safety
violations in (1) the Mountain Car problem, (2) the Lunar Lander benchmark, and
(3) MPC controller for an F-16 autopilot simulator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降压转换器在可再生能源和电动汽车系统中对直流电压调节至关重要，需通过闭环控制系统实现电压调节。

Method: 推导状态空间平均模型以简化非线性开关动态，获取小信号传递函数，并基于频域方法设计PI控制器。

Result: 通过Bode图、阶跃响应和性能指标评估PI控制器，验证其在宽输入电压变化下的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 状态空间平均技术在控制设计中有效，反馈系统在电力电子转换器中表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: This study presents the modeling, control design, and performance analysis of
a DC-DC buck converter using state-space averaging techniques. Buck converters
are essential in modern power electronics for regulating DC voltages in
renewable energy and electric vehicle systems. The paper first introduces the
basic operation of buck converters and emphasizes the need for voltage
regulation through closed-loop control systems. A state-space averaged model is
derived to simplify the nonlinear switched dynamics, enabling a more effective
analysis and controller design. The small-signal transfer function from the
duty cycle to the output voltage is obtained to support control development. In
addition, the Proportional-Integral (PI) control based on the frequency-domain
method was explored. The PI controller was tuned to achieve various phase
margins and is evaluated through Bode plots, step responses, and performance
metrics, revealing trade-offs between overshoot, settling time, and
steady-state error. A complete simulation of the controlled buck converter
verifies its ability to maintain a stable output voltage across wide input
voltage variations. The results validate the effectiveness of state-space
averaging in control design and highlight the robustness of feedback systems in
power electronic converters.

Conclusion: PathFG高效可靠，适用于复杂环境中的自主系统导航。

Abstract: The motion planning problem of generating dynamically feasible,
collision-free trajectories in non-convex environments is a fundamental
challenge for autonomous systems. Decomposing the problem into path planning
and path tracking improves tractability, but integrating these components in a
theoretically sound and computationally efficient manner is challenging. We
propose the Path Feasibility Governor (PathFG), a framework for integrating
path planners with nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC). The PathFG
manipulates the reference passed to the MPC controller, guiding it along a path
while ensuring constraint satisfaction, stability, and recursive feasibility.
The PathFG is modular, compatible with replanning, and improves computational
efficiency and reliability by reducing the need for long prediction horizons.
We prove safety and asymptotic stability with a significantly expanded region
of attraction, and validate its real-time performance through a simulated case
study of quadrotor navigation in a cluttered environment.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著减少了计算负担，同时保持了与传统方法相同的约束筛选效果。

Abstract: Power systems Unit Commitment (UC) problem determines the generator
commitment schedule and dispatch decisions to realize the reliable and economic
operation of power networks. The growing penetration of stochastic renewables
and demand behaviors makes it necessary to solve the UC problem timely. It is
possible to derive lightweight, faster-to-solve UC models via constraint
screening to eliminate redundant constraints. However, the screening process
remains computationally cumbersome due to the need of solving numerous linear
programming (LP) problems. To reduce the number of LPs to solve, we introduce a
novel perspective on such classic LP-based screening. Our key insights lie in
the principle that redundant constraints will be satisfied by all vertices of
the screened feasible region. Using the UC decision variables' bounds tightened
by solving much fewer LPs, we build an outer approximation for the UC feasible
region as the screened region. A matrix operation is then designed and applied
to the outer approximation's vertices to identify all redundant constraints
on-the-fly. Adjustments for the outer approximation are further explored to
improve screening efficiency by considering the load operating range and
cutting planes derived from UC cost and discrete unit status prediction.
Extensive simulations are performed on a set of testbeds up to 2,383 buses to
substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. Compared to classic
LP-based screening, our schemes can achieve up to 8.8x acceleration while
finding the same redundant constraints.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)
approach for autonomous intersection management, aiming to balance traffic

Pareto-optimal policies, with a post-hoc fairness criterion guiding the
selection of the final policy. Simulation results in a complex intersection

equitable service, while fostering safe, efficient, and sustainable practices
in smart urban mobility.

Conclusion: 该方法具有高效性和可扩展性，适用于大规模随机机组组合问题。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural stochastic optimization method for efficiently
solving the two-stage stochastic unit commitment (2S-SUC) problem under
high-dimensional uncertainty scenarios. The proposed method approximates the
second-stage recourse problem using a deep neural network trained to map
commitment decisions and uncertainty features to recourse costs. The trained
network is subsequently embedded into the first-stage UC problem as a
mixed-integer linear program (MILP), allowing for explicit enforcement of
operational constraints while preserving the key uncertainty characteristics. A
scenario-embedding network is employed to enable dimensionality reduction and
feature aggregation across arbitrary scenario sets, serving as a data-driven
scenario reduction mechanism. Numerical experiments on IEEE 5-bus, 30-bus, and
118-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed neural two-stage stochastic
optimization method achieves solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%,
while enabling orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to conventional MILP
solvers and decomposition-based methods. Moreover, the model's size remains
constant regardless of the number of scenarios, offering significant
scalability for large-scale stochastic unit commitment problems.

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性系统噪声条件下的建模提供了一种高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel identification approach of Koopman models of
nonlinear systems with inputs under rather general noise conditions. The method
uses deep state-space encoders based on the concept of state reconstructability
and an efficient multiple-shooting formulation of the squared loss of the
prediction error to estimate the dynamics and the lifted state from
input-output data. Furthermore, the Koopman model structure includes an
innovation noise term that is used to handle process and measurement noise. It
is shown that the proposed approach is statistically consistent and
computationally efficient due to the multiple-shooting formulation where, on
subsections of the data, multi-step prediction errors can be calculated in
parallel. The latter allows for efficient batch optimization of the network
parameters and, at the same time, excellent long-term prediction capabilities
of the obtained models. The performance of the approach is illustrated by
nonlinear benchmark examples.

Result: 模拟研究表明，该方法比固定剂量方案减少65%的PPI用量，且抑酸效果保持在95%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化PPI治疗提供了可行方案，减少治疗负担和过量风险。

Abstract: Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are the standard of care for gastric acid
disorders but carry significant risks when administered chronically at high
doses. Precise long-term control of gastric acidity is challenged by the
impracticality of invasive gastric acid monitoring beyond 72 hours and wide
inter-patient variability. We propose a noninvasive, symptom-based framework
that tailors PPI dosing solely on patient-reported reflux and digestive symptom
patterns. A Bayesian Neural Network prediction model learns to predict patient
symptoms and quantifies its uncertainty from historical symptom scores, meal,
and PPIs intake data. These probabilistic forecasts feed a chance-constrained
Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that dynamically computes future PPI
doses to minimize drug usage while enforcing acid suppression with high
confidence - without any direct acid measurement. In silico studies over
diverse dietary schedules and virtual patient profiles demonstrate that our
learning-augmented MPC reduces total PPI consumption by 65 percent compared to
standard fixed regimens, while maintaining acid suppression with at least 95
percent probability. The proposed approach offers a practical path to
personalized PPI therapy, minimizing treatment burden and overdose risk without
invasive sensors.

Abstract: Public electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is crucial for
accelerating EV adoption and reducing transportation emissions; however,
disparities in infrastructure access have raised significant equity concerns.
This systematic review synthesizes existing knowledge and identifies gaps
regarding equity in EV public charging research. Following structured review
protocols, 91 peer-reviewed studies from Scopus and Google Scholar were
analyzed, focusing explicitly on equity considerations. The findings indicate
that current research on EV public charging equity mainly adopted geographic
information systems (GIS), network optimization, behavioral modeling, and
hybrid analytical frameworks, yet lacks consistent normative frameworks for
assessing equity outcomes. Equity assessments highlight four key dimensions:
spatial accessibility, cost burdens, reliability and usability, and user
awareness and trust. Socio-economic disparities, particularly income, housing
tenure, and ethnicity, frequently exacerbate inequitable access,
disproportionately disadvantaging low-income, renter, and minority populations.
Additionally, infrastructure-specific choices, including charger reliability,
strategic location, and pricing strategies, significantly influence adoption
patterns and equity outcomes. However, existing literature primarily reflects
North American, European, and Chinese contexts, revealing substantial
geographical and methodological limitations. This review suggests the need for
more robust normative evaluations of equity, comprehensive demographic data
integration, and advanced methodological frameworks, thereby guiding targeted,
inclusive, and context-sensitive infrastructure planning and policy
interventions.

Abstract: Optimal power management of battery energy storage systems (BESS) is crucial
for their safe and efficient operation. Numerical optimization techniques are
frequently utilized to solve the optimal power management problems. However,
these techniques often fall short of delivering real-time solutions for
large-scale BESS due to their computational complexity. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a computationally efficient approach. We introduce a new
set of decision variables called power-sharing ratios corresponding to each
cell, indicating their allocated power share from the output power demand. We
then formulate an optimal power management problem to minimize the system-wide
power losses while ensuring compliance with safety, balancing, and power
supply-demand match constraints. To efficiently solve this problem, a
parameterized control policy is designed and leveraged to transform the optimal
power management problem into a parameter estimation problem. We then implement
the ensemble Kalman inversion to estimate the optimal parameter set. The
proposed approach significantly reduces computational requirements due to 1)
the much lower dimensionality of the decision parameters and 2) the estimation
treatment of the optimal power management problem. Finally, we conduct
extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The results show promise in accuracy and computation time compared with
explored numerical optimization techniques.

Conclusion: 拖延策略和阈值学习算法在联合调度问题中高效且实用。

Abstract: We address the problem of optimal joint scheduling of deferrable and
nondeferrable demand involving colocated stochastic supply. Deferrable demand
can be delayed within its service deadline, whereas nondeferrable demand must
be scheduled immediately. Under a finite-horizon stochastic dynamic programming
formulation, we show that the optimal scheduling policy is a ``procrastination
policy'' that delays scheduling as much as possible and is characterized by
three procrastination parameters. Exploiting the low-dimensional
parameterization of the optimal policy, we propose a Procrastination Threshold
Reinforcement Learning algorithm. Numerical experiments based on real-world
test data confirm that the threshold-learning algorithm closely approximates
the optimal policy and outperforms standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: MPC-RL-MOBO框架能有效提升控制系统的学习效率与安全性。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a
structured and interpretable alternative to Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based RL
methods, with lower computational complexity and greater transparency. However,
standard MPC-RL approaches often suffer from slow convergence, suboptimal
policy learning due to limited parameterization, and safety issues during
online adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
that integrates MPC-RL with Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO). The
proposed MPC-RL-MOBO utilizes noisy evaluations of the RL stage cost and its
gradient, estimated via a Compatible Deterministic Policy Gradient (CDPG)
approach, and incorporates them into a MOBO algorithm using the Expected
Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) acquisition function. This fusion enables
efficient and safe tuning of the MPC parameters to achieve improved closed-loop
performance, even under model imperfections. A numerical example demonstrates
the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving sample-efficient,
stable, and high-performance learning for control systems.

data acquisition as a support into a monitoring system has not only improved
its overall performance and reliability but also lowered its operational and
maintenance cost because of its real-time data collection from node sensors.
  As renewable energy needs to be sustainable for it to fully support the
energy demand of communities, its management and control still needs to be
improved and enhanced. Smart systems are considered the next generation
technological improvement of any system that exists. It is the prelude to
autonomous systems from industrial applications to home automation. Data
acquisition is only a part of these smart systems that help in the remote
management and control of these devices. Remote monitoring functionality
enhances the operation and reliability which help in making proactive decisions
during critical situations and circumstances.
  Even with data acquisition enhancements, there is still room for improving
its implementation regarding data security and privacy and accuracy of
information being exchanged between nodes. Current technological advancements
have already shown promising results and have widen its utilization spectrum by
covering almost any field of specialization. With increasing implementation and
design complexity that comes with its enhancements, challenges and issues are
also faced that needs to be addressed and considered to mitigate the effects of

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方法在显著降低复杂度的同时实现了接近最优的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为MIMO ISAC系统提供了一种实用且高效的RF链选择解决方案。

Abstract: In multiple-input multiple-output integrated sensing and communication (MIMO
ISAC) systems, radio frequency chain (i.e., RF chain) selection plays a vital
role in reducing hardware cost, power consumption, and computational
complexity. However, designing an effective RF chain selection strategy is
challenging due to the disparity in performance metrics between communication
and sensing-mutual information (MI) versus beam-pattern mean-squared error
(MSE) or the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). To overcome this, we propose a
low-complexity greedy RF chain selection framework maximizing a unified
MI-based performance metric applicable to both functions. By decomposing the
total MI into individual contributions of each RF chain, we introduce two
approaches: greedy eigen-based selection (GES) and greedy cofactor-based
selection (GCS), which iteratively identify and remove the RF chains with the
lowest contribution. We further extend our framework to beam selection for
beamspace MIMO ISAC systems, introducing diagonal beam selection (DBS) as a
simplified solution. Simulation results show that our proposed methods achieve
near-optimal performance with significantly lower complexity than exhaustive
search, demonstrating their practical effectiveness for MIMO ISAC systems.

Abstract: The angular droop control is a grid-forming control strategy that exploits
the idea of power-to-angle droop to achieve exact frequency synchronization
with no stringent separation between primary and secondary frequency control.
In this work, we conduct hardware experiments in the Smart Energy System
Control Laboratory at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) to test and
validate the angular droop control for low voltage power grids in two different
test scenarios. First, we verify its grid-forming capabilities after a major
event, e.g., following a blackout, demonstrated via power-to-angle droop
behavior. For this, we propose two implementation schemes that rely either on
direct or indirect actuation of the modulation signal and draw a comparison
between them. Second, we investigate the plug-and-play capabilities, i.e.,
local stability and power sharing for a two-converter system and provide
suitable tuning for the control gains. Our experimental findings illustrate the
usefulness of hardware test and validation for DC/AC converter control, the
practical challenges entailed and the proposed remedies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于间隙度量的概率鲁棒控制方法，用于处理随机不确定性对控制系统性能的影响，并提供了概率界限和稳定性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于随机不确定性难以提供硬性鲁棒性保证，因此需要开发概率鲁棒控制方法来评估控制器的性能。

Method: 利用已知名义模型与未知扰动模型之间的间隙度量作为工具，将间隙建模为随机变量，并给出概率界限和期望值。

Conclusion: 通过数值模拟验证了所提方法的有效性，为随机不确定性下的控制系统提供了实用的鲁棒性分析工具。

Abstract: Uncertainties influencing the dynamical systems pose a significant challenge
in estimating the achievable performance of a controller aiming to control such
uncertain systems. When the uncertainties are of stochastic nature, obtaining
hard guarantees for the robustness of a controller aiming to hedge against the
uncertainty is not possible. This issue set the platform for the development of
probabilistic robust control approaches. In this work, we utilise the gap
metric between the known nominal model and the unknown perturbed model of the
uncertain system as a tool to gauge the robustness of a controller and
formulate the gap as a random variable in the setting with stochastic
uncertainties. Main results of this paper includes giving probabilistic bound
on the gap exceeding a known threshold followed by bounds on the expected gap
value and probabilistic robust stability in terms of the gap metric. Further,
we also provide a probabilistic controller performance certification under gap
uncertainty and probabilistic guarantee on the achievable
$\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ robustness. Numerical simulations are provided at many
places to demonstrate the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 本文综述了人工智能（AI）技术在电力系统故障诊断中的应用，包括故障检测、分类和定位，并探讨了传统方法与AI方法的优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力系统组件易受雷击、老化或人为错误导致的故障影响，传统保护方法存在局限性，需要更高效的方法来快速准确地诊断和隔离故障。

Method: 论文分为两部分：介绍AI概念及其在电力系统分析设计中的应用，以及讨论基于AI的故障诊断方法。

Result: AI技术在电力系统故障诊断中显示出巨大潜力，但其应用仍面临挑战，如需要大量训练数据。

Conclusion: AI技术为电力系统故障诊断提供了新的可能性，但仍需进一步研究以克服其局限性。

Abstract: Components of electrical power systems are susceptible to failures caused by
lightning strikes, aging or human errors. These faults can cause equipment
damage, affect system reliability, and results in expensive repair costs. As
electric power systems are becoming more complex, traditional protection
methods face limitations and shortcomings. Faults in power systems can occur at
anytime and anywhere, can be caused by a natural disaster or an accident, and
their occurrence can be hardly predicted or avoided; therefore, it is crucial
to accurately estimate the fault location and quickly restore service. The
development of methods capable of accurately detecting, locating and removing
faults is essential (i.e. fast isolation of faults is necessary to maintain the
system stability at transmission levels; accurate and fast detection and
location of faults are essential for increasing reliability and customer
satisfaction at distribution levels). This has motivated the development of new
and more efficient methods. Methods developed to detect and locate faults in
power systems can be divided into two categories, conventional and artificial
intelligence-based techniques. Although the utilization of artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques offer tremendous potential, they are challenging
and time consuming (i.e. many AI techniques require training data for
processing). This paper presents a survey of the application of AI techniques
to fault diagnosis (detection, classification and location of faults) of lines
and cables of power systems at both transmission and distribution levels. The
paper provides a short introduction to AI concepts, a brief summary of the
application of AI techniques to power system analysis and design, and a
discussion on AI-based fault diagnosis methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献对电网拓扑如何影响电池最优放置以最小化发电成本的理解不足，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将MILP问题分解为LP问题，推导出加权度是唯一拓扑因素，并设计低复杂度算法。

Result: 在树状拓扑下，加权度是唯一影响因素；算法比商业求解器快约100倍且保持高精度。

Conclusion: 加权度是电网中电池最优放置的关键拓扑因素，提出的算法高效且实用。

Abstract: We study the optimal placement of an unlimited-capacity battery in power
grids under a centralized market model, where the independent system operator
(ISO) aims to minimize total generation costs through load shifting. The
optimal battery placement is not well understood by the existing literature,
especially regarding the influence of network topology on minimizing generation
costs. Our work starts with decomposing the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming
(MILP) problem into a series of Linear Programming (LP) formulations. For power
grids with sufficiently large generation capacity or tree topologies, we derive
analytical cost expressions demonstrating that, under reasonable assumptions,
the weighted degree is the only topological factor for optimal battery
placement. We also discuss the minor impact of higher-order topological
conditions on tree-topology networks. To find the localized nature of a single
battery's impact, we establish that the relative cost-saving benefit of a
single battery decreases as the network scales. Furthermore, we design a
low-complexity algorithm for weakly-cyclic networks. Numerical experiments show
that our algorithm is not only approximately 100 times faster than commercial
solvers but also maintains high accuracy even when some theoretical assumptions
are relaxed.

Abstract: Digital twins are increasingly applied in transportation modelling to
replicate real-world traffic dynamics and evaluate mobility and energy
efficiency. This study presents a SUMO-based digital twin that simulates mixed

fusion from inductive loops, GPS probes, and toll records. The model is

Abstract: This work presents several improvements to the closed-loop stability
verification framework using semialgebraic sets and convex semidefinite
programming to examine neural-network-based control systems regulating
nonlinear dynamical systems. First, the utility of the framework is greatly
expanded: two semialgebraic functions mimicking common, smooth activation
functions are presented and compatibility with control systems incorporating
Recurrent Equilibrium Networks (RENs) and thereby Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs) is established. Second, the validity of the framework's state-of-the-art
stability analyses is established via an alternate proof. Third, based on this
proof, two new optimization problems simplifying the analysis of local
stability properties are presented. To simplify the analysis of a closed-loop
system's Region of Attraction (RoA), the first problem explicitly parameterizes
a class of candidate Lyapunov functions larger than in previous works. The
second problem utilizes the unique guarantees available under the condition of
invariance to further expand the set of candidate Lyapunov functions and
directly determine whether an invariant set forms part of the system's RoA.
These contributions are successfully demonstrated in two numerical examples and
suggestions for future research are provided.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型深度学习算法框架，通过融合多模态医学数据，利用不对称跨模态交叉注意力机制，显著提升了阿尔茨海默病的诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络和简单特征拼接方法在多模态数据融合中效果不佳，无法充分利用互补信息，导致关键信息丢失。

Method: 采用不对称跨模态交叉注意力机制，融合脑PET、MRI、遗传数据和临床数据等多模态信息。

Result: 算法在测试集上达到94.88%的准确率。

Conclusion: 不对称跨模态交叉注意力机制在多模态数据融合中表现优异，为AD诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease
characterized by progressive cognitive decline as its main symptom. In the
research field of deep learning-assisted diagnosis of AD, traditional
convolutional neural networks and simple feature concatenation methods fail to
effectively utilize the complementary information between multimodal data, and
the simple feature concatenation approach is prone to cause the loss of key
information during the process of modal fusion. In recent years, the
development of deep learning technology has brought new possibilities for
solving the problem of how to effectively fuse multimodal features. This paper
proposes a novel deep learning algorithm framework to assist medical
professionals in AD diagnosis. By fusing medical multi-view information such as
brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), genetic data, and clinical data, it can accurately detect the
presence of AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN).
The innovation of the algorithm lies in the use of an asymmetric cross-modal
cross-attention mechanism, which can effectively capture the key information
features of the interactions between different data modal features. This paper
compares the asymmetric cross-modal cross-attention mechanism with the
traditional algorithm frameworks of unimodal and multimodal deep learning
models for AD diagnosis, and evaluates the importance of the asymmetric
cross-modal cross-attention mechanism. The algorithm model achieves an accuracy
of 94.88% on the test set.

TL;DR: 开发了一种可解释的AI模型，用于检测胸部CT中的急性心力衰竭（AHF）放射学特征，性能与胸科放射科医生相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于放射科医生短缺，胸部CT扫描在急性心力衰竭诊断中的应用受到限制，AI可作为辅助工具提高诊断精度。

Method: 采用Boosted Trees模型，基于胸部CT扫描中分割的心脏和肺部结构测量数据预测AHF，并使用Shapley Additive explanations解释预测。

Result: 模型在独立测试集上ROC曲线下面积为0.87，部分误分类源于初始放射学报告的不准确。

Conclusion: 该AI模型具有强判别性能，透明化的预测步骤可支持临床决策。

Abstract: Introduction: Chest CT scans are increasingly used in dyspneic patients where
acute heart failure (AHF) is a key differential diagnosis. Interpretation
remains challenging and radiology reports are frequently delayed due to a
radiologist shortage, although flagging such information for emergency
physicians would have therapeutic implication. Artificial intelligence (AI) can
be a complementary tool to enhance the diagnostic precision. We aim to develop
an explainable AI model to detect radiological signs of AHF in chest CT with an
accuracy comparable to thoracic radiologists.
  Methods: A single-center, retrospective study during 2016-2021 at Copenhagen
University Hospital - Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg, Denmark. A Boosted Trees
model was trained to predict AHF based on measurements of segmented cardiac and
pulmonary structures from acute thoracic CT scans. Diagnostic labels for
training and testing were extracted from radiology reports. Structures were
segmented with TotalSegmentator. Shapley Additive explanations values were used
to explain the impact of each measurement on the final prediction.
  Results: Of the 4,672 subjects, 49% were female. The final model incorporated
twelve key features of AHF and achieved an area under the ROC of 0.87 on the
independent test set. Expert radiologist review of model misclassifications
found that 24 out of 64 (38%) false positives and 24 out of 61 (39%) false
negatives were actually correct model predictions, with the errors originating
from inaccuracies in the initial radiology reports.
  Conclusion: We developed an explainable AI model with strong discriminatory
performance, comparable to thoracic radiologists. The AI model's stepwise,
transparent predictions may support decision-making.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的广泛应用，隐私泄露问题日益严重，需要一种有效的方法保护用户隐私。

Method: 将隐私保护问题建模为对抗攻击，提出了一种选择性隐藏ROIs的策略，避免破坏图像整体语义。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三种先进VLMs（LLaVA、Instruct-BLIP和BLIP2-T5）上实现了高达98%的敏感区域隐藏效果，同时保持了图像的全局语义。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态模型的隐私保护提供了实用工具，并推动了隐私意识的提升。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in developing Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) capable of processing both textual and visual inputs. These
models have demonstrated impressive performance, leading to their widespread
adoption in various applications. However, this widespread raises serious
concerns regarding user privacy, particularly when models inadvertently process
or expose private visual information. In this work, we frame the preservation
of privacy in VLMs as an adversarial attack problem. We propose a novel attack
strategy that selectively conceals information within designated Region Of
Interests (ROIs) in an image, effectively preventing VLMs from accessing
sensitive content while preserving the semantic integrity of the remaining
image. Unlike conventional adversarial attacks that often disrupt the entire
image, our method maintains high coherence in unmasked areas. Experimental
results across three state-of-the-art VLMs namely LLaVA, Instruct-BLIP, and
BLIP2-T5 demonstrate up to 98% reduction in detecting targeted ROIs, while
maintaining global image semantics intact, as confirmed by high similarity
scores between clean and adversarial outputs. We believe that this work
contributes to a more privacy conscious use of multimodal models and offers a
practical tool for further research, with the source code publicly available

Result: 相比基线U-Net模型，Dice分数提高了4.1%，分割精度更高。

Conclusion: 该方法在椎骨轮廓提取中表现出更高的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: In spinal vertebral mobility disease, accurately extracting and contouring
vertebrae is essential for assessing mobility impairments and monitoring
variations during flexion-extension movements. Precise vertebral contouring
plays a crucial role in surgical planning; however, this process is
traditionally performed manually by radiologists or surgeons, making it
labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. In particular,
mobility disease analysis requires the individual contouring of each vertebra,
which is both tedious and susceptible to inconsistencies. Automated methods
provide a more efficient alternative, enabling vertebra identification,
segmentation, and contouring with greater accuracy and reduced time
consumption. In this study, we propose a novel U-Net variation designed to
accurately segment thoracic vertebrae from anteroposterior view on X-Ray
images. Our proposed approach, incorporating a ``sandwich" U-Net structure with
dual activation functions, achieves a 4.1\% improvement in Dice score compared
to the baseline U-Net model, enhancing segmentation accuracy while ensuring
reliable vertebral contour extraction.

Abstract: There has been increasing interest in the generation of high-quality,
realistic synthetic medical images in recent years. Such synthetic datasets can
mitigate the scarcity of public datasets for artificial intelligence research,
and can also be used for educational purposes. In this paper, we propose a
combination of diffusion-based generation (PanoDiff) and Super-Resolution (SR)
for generating synthetic dental panoramic radiographs (PRs). The former
generates a low-resolution (LR) seed of a PR (256 X 128) which is then
processed by the SR model to yield a high-resolution (HR) PR of size 1024 X
512. For SR, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer that learns local-global
relationships, resulting in sharper edges and textures. Experimental results
demonstrate a Frechet inception distance score of 40.69 between 7243 real and
synthetic images (in HR). Inception scores were 2.55, 2.30, 2.90 and 2.98 for
real HR, synthetic HR, real LR and synthetic LR images, respectively. Among a
diverse group of six clinical experts, all evaluating a mixture of 100
synthetic and 100 real PRs in a time-limited observation, the average accuracy
in distinguishing real from synthetic images was 68.5% (with 50% corresponding
to random guessing).

Conclusion: 可编程掩模不仅提升安全性，还可用于图像认证和防伪，为对抗深度伪造提供新方案。

Abstract: Lensless cameras replace traditional optics with thin masks, leading to
highly multiplexed measurements akin to encryption. However, static masks in
conventional designs leave systems vulnerable to simple attacks. This work
explores the use of programmable masks to enhance security by dynamically
varying the mask patterns. We perform our experiments with a low-cost system
(around 100 USD) based on a liquid crystal display. Experimental results
demonstrate that variable masks successfully block a variety of attacks while
enabling high-quality recovery for legitimate users. The system's encryption
strength exceeds AES-256, achieving effective key lengths over 2'500 bits.
Additionally, we demonstrate how a programmable mask enables robust
authentication and verification, as each mask pattern leaves a unique
fingerprint on the image. When combined with a lensed system, lensless
measurements can serve as analog certificates, providing a novel solution for
verifying image authenticity and combating deepfakes.

Motivation: ISAR中雷达回波矩阵的随机缺失会降低成像质量，现有方法（如压缩感知或矩阵补全）在高缺失率或稀疏约束下表现不佳。

Method: 使用独立的深度结构分别补全雷达数据的实部和虚部，再通过傅里叶成像生成雷达图像。

Result: 与IALM、2D-SL0和NNM方法相比，DIP方法在RMSE、相关性和IC指标上分别提高了100%、50%和30%。

Conclusion: DIP方法在极端情况下显著提升了ISAR成像质量，优于现有技术。

Abstract: In Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR), random missing entries of the
received radar echo matrix deteriorate the imaging quality, compromising target
distinction from the background. Compressive sensing techniques or matrix
completion prior to conventional imaging have been used in recent years to
solve this issue. However, while the former techniques fail to preserve target
continuity due to the sparsity constraint, the latter fails for high missing
ratios. This paper proposes to use deep image prior (DIP) to complete the
complex radar data and then obtain the radar image by conventional Fourier
imaging. Real and imaginary parts are separately completed by independent deep
structures and then put together for the imaging part. The proposed DIP based
imaging method has been compared with IALM, 2D-SL0 and NNM methods visually and
quantitatively for both simulated and real data. The results demonstrate an
increase of 100% for some extreme cases in terms of RMSE, 50% increase on
Correlation and 30% increase on IC metrics quantitatively.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for phase retrieval that leverages Langevin

perception-distortion tradeoff through a principled combination of stochastic
sampling, learned denoising, and model-based updates. The framework comprises
three variants of increasing complexity, integrating theoretically grounded
Langevin inference, adaptive noise schedule learning, parallel reconstruction
sampling, and warm-start initialization from classical solvers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple benchmarks, both in terms of fidelity and perceptual quality.

Abstract: Phase retrieval involves recovering a signal from intensity-only
measurements, crucial in many fields such as imaging, holography, optical
computing, crystallography, and microscopy. Although there are several
well-known phase retrieval algorithms, including classical iterative solvers,
the reconstruction performance often remains sensitive to initialization and
measurement noise. Recently, image-to-image diffusion models have gained
traction in various image reconstruction tasks, yielding significant
theoretical insights and practical breakthroughs. In this work, we introduce a
novel phase retrieval approach based on an image-to-image diffusion framework
called Inversion by Direct Iteration. Our method begins with an enhanced
initialization stage that leverages a hybrid iterative technique, combining the
Hybrid Input-Output and Error Reduction methods and incorporating a novel
acceleration mechanism to obtain a robust crude estimate. Then, it iteratively
refines this initial crude estimate using the learned image-to-image pipeline.
Our method achieves substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our approach utilizes aggregation
techniques to refine quality metrics and demonstrates superior results compared
to both classical and contemporary techniques. This highlights its potential
for effective and efficient phase retrieval across various applications.

Abstract: Medical Imagings are considered one of the crucial diagnostic tools for
different bones-related diseases, especially bones fractures. This paper
investigates the robustness of pre-trained deep learning models for classifying
bone fractures in X-ray images and seeks to address global healthcare disparity
through the lens of technology. Three deep learning models have been tested
under varying simulated equipment quality conditions. ResNet50, VGG16 and
EfficientNetv2 are the three pre-trained architectures which are compared.
These models were used to perform bone fracture classification as images were
progressively degraded using noise. This paper specifically empirically studies
how the noise can affect the bone fractures detection and how the pre-trained
models performance can be changes due to the noise that affect the quality of
the X-ray images. This paper aims to help replicate real world challenges
experienced by medical imaging technicians across the world. Thus, this paper
establishes a methodological framework for assessing AI model degradation using
transfer learning and controlled noise augmentation. The findings provide
practical insight into how robust and generalizable different pre-trained deep
learning powered computer vision models can be when used in different contexts.

Abstract: Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in children under five, requiring
accurate chest X-ray diagnosis. This study presents a machine learning-based
Pediatric Chest Pneumonia Classification System to assist healthcare
professionals in diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The CNN-based
model was trained on 5,863 labeled chest X-ray images from children aged 0-5

limited data, we applied augmentation techniques (rotation, zooming, shear,
horizontal flipping) and employed GANs to generate synthetic images, addressing
class imbalance. The system achieved optimal performance using combined
original, augmented, and GAN-generated data, evaluated through accuracy and F1

*Shengjie Liu,Lu Zhang,Siqin Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种物理引导的深度学习框架，用于整合高时空分辨率温度数据，填补现有观测与模型之间的分辨率差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测中空间与时间分辨率的权衡是关键问题，尤其是温度数据的高分辨率需求。现有技术无法同时满足高时空分辨率，且受云层影响。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络，结合年温度周期和线性项，将粗分辨率地球系统模型输出放大为卫星观测的精细尺度温度值。

Result: 通过GOES-16和Landsat数据验证，框架在四个数据集上实现了有效的温度重建。

Conclusion: 该框架为全球全天候高分辨率温度数据生成提供了新可能。

Abstract: Central to Earth observation is the trade-off between spatial and temporal
resolution. For temperature, this is especially critical because real-world
applications require high spatiotemporal resolution data. Current technology
allows for hourly temperature observations at 2 km, but only every 16 days at
100 m, a gap further exacerbated by cloud cover. Earth system models offer
continuous hourly temperature data, but at a much coarser spatial resolution
(9-31 km). Here, we present a physics-guided deep learning framework for
temperature data reconstruction that integrates these two data sources. The
proposed framework uses a convolutional neural network that incorporates the
annual temperature cycle and includes a linear term to amplify the coarse Earth
system model output into fine-scale temperature values observed from
satellites. We evaluated this framework using data from two satellites, GOES-16
(2 km, hourly) and Landsat (100 m, every 16 days), and demonstrated effective
temperature reconstruction with hold-out and in situ data across four datasets.
This physics-guided deep learning framework opens new possibilities for
generating high-resolution temperature data across spatial and temporal scales,
under all weather conditions and globally.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of U-Net architectures integrated
with various convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones for automated lung
cancer detection and segmentation in chest CT images, addressing the critical
need for accurate diagnostic tools in clinical settings. A balanced dataset of
832 chest CT images (416 cancerous and 416 non-cancerous) was preprocessed
using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and resized to
128x128 pixels. U-Net models were developed with three CNN backbones: ResNet50,
VGG16, and Xception, to segment lung regions. After segmentation, CNN-based
classifiers and hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and
Gradient Boosting) were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Metrics
included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Dice coefficient, and ROC-AUC.
U-Net with ResNet50 achieved the best performance for cancerous lungs (Dice:
0.9495, Accuracy: 0.9735), while U-Net with VGG16 performed best for
non-cancerous segmentation (Dice: 0.9532, Accuracy: 0.9513). For
classification, the CNN model using U-Net with Xception achieved 99.1 percent
accuracy, 99.74 percent recall, and 99.42 percent F1-score. The hybrid
CNN-SVM-Xception model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy and 97.88 percent
F1-score. Compared to prior methods, our framework consistently outperformed
existing models. In conclusion, combining U-Net with advanced CNN backbones
provides a powerful method for both segmentation and classification of lung
cancer in CT scans, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IM-LUT的新框架，用于任意尺度图像超分辨率（ASISR），通过混合插值函数提高效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于查找表（LUT）的方法仅适用于固定尺度，而现有ASISR方法计算成本高且内存需求大。

Method: 提出IM-LUT框架，通过IM-Net预测插值函数的混合权重，并利用LUT替换计算密集型操作。

Result: 实验表明IM-LUT在图像质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IM-LUT是一种适用于资源受限应用的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has been a pivotal task in image processing, aimed at
enhancing image resolution across various applications. Recently, look-up table
(LUT)-based approaches have attracted interest due to their efficiency and
performance. However, these methods are typically designed for fixed scale
factors, making them unsuitable for arbitrary-scale image SR (ASISR). Existing
ASISR techniques often employ implicit neural representations, which come with
considerable computational cost and memory demands. To address these
limitations, we propose Interpolation Mixing LUT (IM-LUT), a novel framework
that operates ASISR by learning to blend multiple interpolation functions to
maximize their representational capacity. Specifically, we introduce IM-Net, a
network trained to predict mixing weights for interpolation functions based on
local image patterns and the target scale factor. To enhance efficiency of
interpolation-based methods, IM-Net is transformed into IM-LUT, where LUTs are
employed to replace computationally expensive operations, enabling lightweight
and fast inference on CPUs while preserving reconstruction quality.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that IM-LUT
consistently achieves a superior balance between image quality and efficiency
compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential as a promising
solution for resource-constrained applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑肿瘤形态异质性和复杂空间关系导致的自动分割难题，充分利用医学报告中的语义知识。

Method: 采用多级融合架构，结合CLIP模型的语义理解能力和3D U-Net的空间特征提取，通过3D-2D语义桥接、跨模态语义引导和基于语义的注意力机制。

Result: 在BraTS 2020数据集上，整体Dice系数达0.8567，比传统3D U-Net提升4.8%，增强肿瘤区域提升7.3%。

Conclusion: 多级融合架构显著提升脑肿瘤分割性能，尤其在临床关键区域表现突出。

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances
in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to
tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial
relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted
from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical
reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that
integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information,
facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level
concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding
capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the
spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms:
3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based
attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of
0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with
a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor
(ET) region.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet the variability in imaging quality across different MRI
scanners presents significant challenges to model generalization. To address
this, we propose the Edge Iterative MRI Lesion Localization System
(EdgeIMLocSys), which integrates Continuous Learning from Human Feedback to
adaptively fine-tune segmentation models based on clinician feedback, thereby
enhancing robustness to scanner-specific imaging characteristics. Central to
this system is the Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for
Brain Tumor Segmentation (GMLN-BTS), which employs a Modality-Aware Adaptive
Encoder (M2AE) to extract multi-scale semantic features efficiently, and a
Graph-based Multi-Modal Collaborative Interaction Module (G2MCIM) to model
complementary cross-modal relationships via graph structures. Additionally, we
introduce a novel Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module (VRUM) that
synergistically combines linear interpolation and multi-scale transposed
convolutions to suppress artifacts while preserving high-frequency details,
improving segmentation boundary accuracy. Our proposed GMLN-BTS model achieves
a Dice score of 85.1% on the BraTS2017 dataset with only 4.58 million
parameters, representing a 98% reduction compared to mainstream 3D Transformer
models, and significantly outperforms existing lightweight approaches. This
work demonstrates a synergistic breakthrough in achieving high-accuracy,
resource-efficient brain tumor segmentation suitable for deployment in
resource-constrained clinical environments.
