<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类与自然关系是否能从支配转向相互依存，以及AI如何作为中介推动这一转变。

Method: 通过案例研究分析AI在数据、图像识别和生态修复中的应用，并结合原型设计提出AI与植物修复结合的方法。

Result: AI不仅扩展了创意方法，还重构了生态设计的理论与实践，展示了其在科学、艺术和环保中的潜力。

Conclusion: AI为可持续技术生态系统提供了研究路径，未来可进一步探索其在生态设计中的应用。

Abstract: This paper asks whether our relationship with nature can move from human
dominance to genuine interdependence, and whether artificial intelligence (AI)
can mediate that shift. We examine a new ecological-design paradigm in which AI
interacts with non-human life forms. Through case studies we show how artists
and designers apply AI for data analysis, image recognition, and ecological
restoration, producing results that differ from conventional media. We argue
that AI not only expands creative methods but also reframes the theory and
practice of ecological design. Building on the author's prototype for
AI-assisted water remediation, the study proposes design pathways that couple
reinforcement learning with plant-based phytoremediation. The findings
highlight AI's potential to link scientific insight, artistic practice, and
environmental stewardship, offering a roadmap for future research on
sustainable, technology-enabled ecosystems.

Abstract: We introduce a modular harness design for LLM agents that composes of
perception, memory, and reasoning components, enabling a single LLM or VLM
backbone to tackle a wide spectrum of multi turn gaming environments without
domain-specific engineering. Using classic and modern game suites as
low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow
for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive
settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay
performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct
contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles
while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight
the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose
agent, given the familiarity and ubiquity of games in everyday human
experience.

### [3] [Let's Think in Two Steps: Mitigating Agreement Bias in MLLMs with Self-Grounded Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11662)
*Moises Andrade,Joonhyuk Cha,Brandon Ho,Vriksha Srihari,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs作为验证器在复杂任务中存在一致性偏差问题，SGV方法通过自生成先验和条件生成提升验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在无明确成功标准的领域（如计算机使用）中扩展AI验证器能力的挑战。

Method: 提出自接地验证（SGV），通过无条件生成和条件生成两步法优化MLLMs的验证能力。

Result: SGV使MLLMs验证准确率提升20%，任务完成率提升48%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: SGV有效缓解MLLMs的一致性偏差，显著提升其在复杂任务中的验证性能。

Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key
for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these
gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains
a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this
intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,
human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as
verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and
robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a
strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often
generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is
pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several
methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs
despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To
address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method
that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing
their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV
operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors
about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,
conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate
trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in
accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of
heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,
a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting
a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

### [5] [Auto-Formulating Dynamic Programming Problems with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11737)
*Chenyu Zhou,Jingyuan Yang,Linwei Xin,Yitian Chen,Ziyan He,Dongdong Ge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DPLM的专门用于动态规划（DP）问题的语言模型，通过DualReflect数据生成方法解决了训练数据不足的问题，并在DP-Bench基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态规划问题因其随机性和数据稀缺性难以直接应用现有LLM模型，需要一种专门的方法来自动化DP模型构建。

Method: 提出DPLM模型和DualReflect数据生成方法，结合前向生成（多样性）和后向生成（可靠性）以扩展训练数据。

Result: DPLM在DP-Bench上表现优于现有LLM模型，尤其在复杂问题上。

Conclusion: 前向和后向生成方法的结合是解决数据稀缺问题的有效策略，DPLM展示了在DP问题上的潜力。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but
formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the
problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the
potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges
due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of
training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing
LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such
as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark
covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic
evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a
7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on
hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel
synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a
limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for
diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key
insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong
correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such
guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse
formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both
approaches and the importance of combining them.

### [7] [A Parallel CPU-GPU Framework for Cost-Bounded DFS with Applications to IDA* and BTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11916)

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用GPU并行计算优化深度优先搜索（DFS）的方法，称为成本受限深度优先搜索（CB-DFS），并扩展了Batch IDA*和Batch BTS算法。实验验证了该方法在3x3魔方和4x4滑块拼图上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU技术的快速发展为经典搜索算法的优化提供了新机会，但目前很少有算法在搜索过程中充分利用GPU。

Method: 提出CB-DFS方法，结合CPU和GPU的并行计算能力，扩展了Batch IDA*和Batch BTS算法，基于AIDA*框架并保持最优性保证。

Conclusion: CB-DFS方法成功将GPU并行计算引入DFS，显著提升了搜索效率，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel
processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search
algorithms. A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large
pattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving
heuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to
exploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU
computations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations
in depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded
depth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of
modern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \emph{Batch IDA*},
an extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an
extensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach
used by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality
guarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding
tile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in
DFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of
hyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on
performance.

### [8] [Aime: Towards Fully-Autonomous Multi-Agent Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11988)
*Yexuan Shi,Mingyu Wang,Yunxiang Cao,Hongjie Lai,Junjian Lan,Xin Han,Yu Wang,Jie Geng,Zhenan Li,Zihao Xia,Xiang Chen,Chen Li,Jian Xu,Wenbo Duan,Yuanshuo Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Aime是一个新型多智能体框架，通过动态反应式规划和执行解决传统规划-执行框架的局限性，显著提升多智能体系统的适应性和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Aime表现优于现有最先进的专用智能体，展示了更高的适应性和任务成功率。

Conclusion: Aime为多智能体协作提供了更灵活、高效的框架，适用于动态环境中的复杂任务。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are
emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems.
However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent
plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan
execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These
weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome
these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime
replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive
architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that
continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution
feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation,
assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and
(3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of
truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime
on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software
engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The
results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized
state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability
and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective
foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

### [9] [Understanding visual attention beehind bee-inspired UAV navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11992)
*Pranav Rajbhandari,Abhi Veda,Matthew Garratt,Mandayam Srinivasan,Sridhar Ravi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于光流感知的强化学习无人机导航策略，发现训练后的智能体主要关注光流不连续区域和大光流区域，行为类似昆虫飞行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物系统（如蜜蜂）在有限感知和计算能力下仍能高效飞行和避障，启发研究光流感知在无人机导航中的应用。

Method: 使用强化学习训练智能体仅依赖光流输入在障碍隧道中导航，并分析其注意力模式。

Result: 智能体主要关注光流不连续区域和大光流区域，行为类似昆虫飞行，且策略在独立训练中表现一致。

Conclusion: 该策略可能适用于开发简单明确的无人机控制法则。

Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the
capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite
limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly
use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their
visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a
Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only
optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained
agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base
their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most
attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with
large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered
tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while
maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the
behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently
trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for
developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.

### [10] [Topology Enhanced MARL for Multi-Vehicle Cooperative Decision-Making of CAVs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12110)
*Ye Han,Lijun Zhang,Dejian Meng,Zhuang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种拓扑增强的多智能体强化学习方法（TPE-MARL），用于优化混合交通中联网自动驾驶车辆（CAV）的协作决策，通过压缩高维状态信息和减少搜索空间，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习（MARL）中探索-利用权衡的挑战，特别是在混合交通环境下，CAV的协作决策问题。

Method: 构建动态交通流的游戏拓扑张量，压缩高维状态信息；基于QMIX算法，结合访问计数和智能体互信息，建立拓扑增强的MARL框架。

Result: TPE-MARL在多种交通密度和CAV渗透率下表现出色，平衡了探索与利用，提升了交通效率、安全性、决策平滑性和任务完成度。

Conclusion: TPE-MARL在混合和全自动驾驶场景中表现出优于或等同于人类驾驶员的决策合理性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental
challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint
state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)
method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:
First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,
effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease
the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game
topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a
topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual
information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV
penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations
encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic
performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL
successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits
superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision
smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates
decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in
both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios. Code of our work is

*Edward Kim,Hanna Kurniawati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的在线近似POMDP求解器，通过深度采样未来历史并逐步更新策略，性能损失由采样误差的平均值而非最大值决定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线规划中采样稀疏性问题，提升动态环境下的决策性能。

Method: 采用部分可观测参考策略编程，深度采样未来历史并强制逐步策略更新。

Result: 在动态环境的大规模问题（如直升机紧急场景）中显著优于现有在线基准。

Conclusion: 算法在理论和实验上均表现出色，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a
novel anytime online approximate POMDP solver which samples meaningful future
histories very deeply while simultaneously forcing a gradual policy update. We
provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say
that the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling
approximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given
the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two
large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a
helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150
planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our
solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate building energy forecasting is essential, yet traditional heuristics
often lack precision, while advanced models can be opaque and struggle with
generalization by neglecting physical principles. This paper introduces
BuildEvo, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to
automatically design effective and interpretable energy prediction heuristics.
Within an evolutionary process, BuildEvo guides LLMs to construct and enhance
heuristics by systematically incorporating physical insights from building
characteristics and operational data (e.g., from the Building Data Genome
Project 2). Evaluations show BuildEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance on

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在空间战略推理（如中国象棋）中的不足，并提出了一种针对中国象棋的训练框架Xiangqi-R1，显著提升了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在空间战略推理中的能力，填补其在复杂棋盘游戏中的研究空白。

Method: 采用多阶段训练框架：1）微调合法移动预测；2）融入战略注释；3）通过GRPO强化学习提升推理稳定性。

Result: Xiangqi-R1在移动合法性和分析准确性上分别提升了18%和22%，优于通用LLMs。

Conclusion: 该研究为在空间复杂领域开发通用战略智能提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness
in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully
observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt
Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate
rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such
environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a
large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert
annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning
for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating
strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying
reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our
Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power,
general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these
tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an
18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results
point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in
spatially complex areas.

### [14] [An Memory-Efficient Framework for Deformable Transformer with Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11549)
*Wendong Mao,Mingfan Zhao,Jianfeng Guan,Qiwei Dong,Zhongfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种硬件友好的优化框架，通过NAS和新的切片策略优化DAT的内存访问模式，同时在FPGA上验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAT的数据依赖性采样机制导致不规则内存访问模式，难以高效部署硬件，现有方法要么硬件开销高，要么牺牲模型精度。

Method: 1. 提出基于NAS和切片策略的方法，自动划分输入特征为均匀块；2. 设计FPGA验证系统。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上仅损失0.2%精度；FPGA实验显示DRAM访问次数减少至现有方法的18%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在保持精度的同时显著优化了硬件效率。

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in
computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions.
However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory
access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware
deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead
or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture
search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to
automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the
inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model
architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly
optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based
verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on
edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset
demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2%
accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA
show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with
existing DAT acceleration methods.

### [15] [Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550)
*Hyeonseok Jin,Geonmin Kim,Kyungbaek Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DDCN的新方法，用于高效且准确的时空交通预测，解决了传统方法的局限性和GNN的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉时空异质性和处理大规模数据时存在不足，GNN需要预定义邻接矩阵且计算复杂。

Method: DDCN通过动态应用可变形滤波器，结合编码器-解码器结构，利用空间和时空注意力块强调重要特征。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，DDCN性能优越，验证了CNN方法在时空交通预测中的潜力。

Conclusion: DDCN是一种高效且准确的时空交通预测方法，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent
transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas.
Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important,
some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic
patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require
predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data
containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for
accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and
spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically
applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes
transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed
approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder
to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module,
complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can
perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments
on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing
the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal
traffic prediction.

alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human
preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive
training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial
computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel
alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts
intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic
inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new
post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward
models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and
efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image
generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive
experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO
compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the
trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent
images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a
paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations
and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of
generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,
high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to
complex realistic generation tasks. Our code is available at

*Changlu Chen,Yanbin Liu,Chaoxi Niu,Ling Chen,Tianqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-VFM是一个新颖的框架，通过重新编程视觉基础模型（VFMs）来解决时空预测任务中的挑战，包括时间建模能力和模态差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基础模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中表现出色，但在时空预测中，大型语言模型（LLMs）难以捕捉丰富的时空相关性。因此，需要一种方法将视觉基础模型（VFMs）重新编程以适用于时空预测。

Method: ST-VFM采用双分支架构，结合原始时空输入和辅助时空流输入，并通过预VFM和后VFM两个重新编程阶段处理这些输入。预VFM阶段嵌入时间上下文并对齐分支，后VFM阶段通过提示条件动态交互分支。

Result: 在十个时空数据集上的实验表明，ST-VFM优于现有基线，展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ST-VFM是一个强大的通用框架，适用于时空预测任务，且不依赖修改冻结的VFM主干。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling
complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language
models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture
one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer
spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In
this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically
reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal
forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise
when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling
capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,
ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs
with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal
difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively
process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming
stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token
Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible
feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral
Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches
through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning
without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten
spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones
(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong
general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

TL;DR: xOp-GAN是一种新型GAN模型，通过多个专家生成器网络解决水下图像恢复问题，每个生成器专注于特定质量范围的图像恢复，最终由判别器选择最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单生成器GAN模型难以应对水下图像的复杂退化问题，需要一种能处理异质性退化范围的方法。

Method: 提出xOp-GAN，包含多个专家生成器网络，每个生成器针对特定质量范围的图像进行训练，并由判别器选择最佳恢复结果。

Result: 在LSUI数据集上，xOp-GAN的PSNR达到25.16 dB，显著优于单回归器模型。

Conclusion: xOp-GAN通过多生成器和判别器的协同工作，显著提升了水下图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light
propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater
image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep
regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to
perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network
is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In
order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with
several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset
with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its
restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is
trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image
can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence
score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators
where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression
task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)
dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB,
surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced
complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过综述59项研究和分析大规模数据集，评估了基于步态估计年龄的方法，发现多传感器融合误差最低（3.4年），并揭示了步态指标与年龄的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态年龄估计在医疗、安全和人机交互中有重要应用，但现有研究缺乏统一的性能基准和实用指南。

Method: 综述59项研究，分析大规模数据集（如OU-ISIR和VersatileGait），使用卷积神经网络（ResNet34）和支持向量机等方法进行实验。

Result: 多传感器融合误差最低（3.4年），步态指标与年龄相关性显著（相关系数≥0.27），深度网络准确率达96%。

Conclusion: 通过综合分析和大规模实验，提出了降低步态年龄估计误差至3年以下的实用指南，并建立了性能基准。

Abstract: Estimating a person's age from their gait has important applications in
healthcare, security and human-computer interaction. In this work, we review
fifty-nine studies involving over seventy-five thousand subjects recorded with
video, wearable and radar sensors. We observe that convolutional neural
networks produce an average error of about 4.2 years, inertial-sensor models
about 4.5 years and multi-sensor fusion as low as 3.4 years, with notable
differences between lab and real-world data. We then analyse sixty-three
thousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population
dataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride
length, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle
entropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27. Next, we fine-tune a
ResNet34 model and apply Grad-CAM to reveal that the network attends to the
knee and pelvic regions, consistent with known age-related gait changes.
Finally, on a one hundred thousand sample subset of the VersatileGait database,
we compare support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, multilayer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, finding that deep networks
achieve up to 96 percent accuracy while processing each sample in under 0.1
seconds. By combining a broad meta-analysis with new large-scale experiments
and interpretable visualizations, we establish solid performance baselines and
practical guidelines for reducing gait-age error below three years in
real-world scenarios.

Method: 改进PPGNet模型（原用于识别阿穆尔虎）为PPGNet-Cat，并探索对比学习方法如ArcFace损失。

Result: PPGNet-Cat表现优异，mAP达0.86，rank-1准确率为0.95。

Conclusion: PPGNet-Cat是一种高效的野猫识别模型，适用于实际监控需求。

Abstract: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife,
placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore,
closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects.
In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges
to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured
by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a
re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main
approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model,
initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats.
This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific
modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally,
various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning
approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat
excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes
establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

Abstract: We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that
jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a
unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is
Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are
projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation,
facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation
addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive
parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches.
Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL)
from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Language-Guided Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked
Autoencoders (LG-CAV-MAE) to improve audio-visual representation learning.
LG-CAV-MAE integrates a pretrained text encoder into contrastive audio-visual
masked autoencoders, enabling the model to learn across audio, visual and text
modalities. To train LG-CAV-MAE, we introduce an automatic method to generate
audio-visual-text triplets from unlabeled videos. We first generate frame-level
captions using an image captioning model and then apply CLAP-based filtering to
ensure strong alignment between audio and captions. This approach yields
high-quality audio-visual-text triplets without requiring manual annotations.
We evaluate LG-CAV-MAE on audio-visual retrieval tasks, as well as an
audio-visual classification task. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving up to a 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval tasks
and a 3.2% improvement for the classification task.

Motivation: 现有基于淋巴结大小、形状和纹理的放射学标准诊断准确性有限，VAE能直接编码视觉特征和有意义的数据模式，生成更可解释的潜在空间。

Method: 提出VAE-MLP模型，利用VAE作为特征编码器，在168例未接受新辅助治疗的患者的MRI数据集上进行验证。

Result: 模型在MRI数据集上表现优异，交叉验证指标为AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05，敏感性0.79 +/- 0.06，特异性0.85 +/- 0.05。

Conclusion: VAE-MLP模型在直肠癌淋巴结转移分期中具有高准确性和可解释性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node
metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node
(LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In
this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature
encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the
generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual
features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled
and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models
are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo
neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the
ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP'
achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated
metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85

Conclusion: 姿势分析能有效推断意图，弱监督验证为解决数据标注限制提供了可能，为体育分析和行为分析开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing
fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains.
Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being
translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious
challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we
identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from
human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in
the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human
intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over
80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through
motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals
for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline.
Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to
validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data
labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques
for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior
analysis across various fields.

TL;DR: VISTA是一种基于分割和跟踪的单目全局定位框架，能够在不同视角和季节变化下实现一致定位，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无结构环境中因视角变化、季节变化等导致的传统定位方法失效问题。

Method: 结合前端基于对象的分割跟踪管道和子图对应搜索，利用几何一致性对齐参考帧。

Result: 在季节和斜视角航空数据集上，召回率提升69%，地图大小仅为基线方法的0.6%。

Conclusion: VISTA无需领域特定训练，适用于资源受限平台，实现高效实时定位。

Abstract: Global localization is critical for autonomous navigation, particularly in
scenarios where an agent must localize within a map generated in a different
session or by another agent, as agents often have no prior knowledge about the
correlation between reference frames. However, this task remains challenging in
unstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint
variation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure
modes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges,
we propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame
Alignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that
combines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,
followed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric
consistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA
enables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal
changes, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We
evaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a
69% improvement in recall over baseline methods. Furthermore, we maintain a
compact object-based map that is only 0.6% the size of the most
memory-conservative baseline, making our approach capable of real-time
implementation on resource-constrained platforms.

Result: 部分VLMs在整体场景理解上表现优异，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具竞争力且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 轻量级CNN适合边缘部署，同时发布了天气增强的基准数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet
accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is
still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines
excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor
scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering
end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work
systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B,
InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline
(PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with
synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results
reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight
CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction
of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To
foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and
evaluation code publicly.

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and
generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with
human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial
intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable
success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs
or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often
means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,
which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific
approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver
(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we
prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of
estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we
illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional
generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a
single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning
ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of
zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from
unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions
from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in
affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced
semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods
still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional
cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently
effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to
emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular
Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates
dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal
alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient
spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual
descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and
highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference
weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at
the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on
three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves
recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or
imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
terms of both UAR and WAR.

Conclusion: CorrMoE框架在跨域和跨场景任务中表现出色，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Establishing reliable correspondences between image pairs is a fundamental
task in computer vision, underpinning applications such as 3D reconstruction
and visual localization. Although recent methods have made progress in pruning
outliers from dense correspondence sets, they often hypothesize consistent
visual domains and overlook the challenges posed by diverse scene structures.
In this paper, we propose CorrMoE, a novel correspondence pruning framework
that enhances robustness under cross-domain and cross-scene variations. To
address domain shift, we introduce a De-stylization Dual Branch, performing
style mixing on both implicit and explicit graph features to mitigate the
adverse influence of domain-specific representations. For scene diversity, we
design a Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts module that adaptively integrates
multi-perspective features through linear-complexity attention and dynamic
expert routing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CorrMoE achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code and pre-trained models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频信息对语义分割精度至关重要，但下采样层可能导致其失真或混叠。

Method: 使用自适应重采样（ARS）调制高频特征，并通过多尺度自适应上采样（MSAU）解调，恢复高频信息。

Result: 有效减少混叠并保留细节，适用于多种任务和架构。

Conclusion: SFM方法在多种视觉任务中表现出广泛的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures,
significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However,
according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components
are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling
layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency
Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency
before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.
Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and
design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to
scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the
Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling
(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency
information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves
segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely
and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly
integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural
networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our
method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details
after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and
effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial
robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. The code is

TL;DR: ProtoConNet提出了一种原型增强和对齐方法，通过整合背景信息提升少样本图像分类的性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本图像分类方法通常忽略上下文信息的整合，导致性能受限。

Method: ProtoConNet包含三个模块：基于聚类的数据选择（CDS）、上下文增强语义细化（CSR）和原型对齐（PA），分别用于数据多样性挖掘、上下文整合和特征距离优化。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，ProtoConNet在少样本场景下提升了表示学习效果，并能有效识别开放集样本。

Conclusion: ProtoConNet通过整合上下文信息，显著提升了少样本开放集分类的性能。

Abstract: Open-set few-shot image classification aims to train models using a small
amount of labeled data, enabling them to achieve good generalization when
confronted with unknown environments. Existing methods mainly use visual
information from a single image to learn class representations to distinguish
known from unknown categories. However, these methods often overlook the
benefits of integrating rich contextual information. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a prototypical augmentation and alignment method, termed
ProtoConNet, which incorporates background information from different samples
to enhance the diversity of the feature space, breaking the spurious
associations between context and image subjects in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, it consists of three main modules: the clustering-based data
selection (CDS) module mines diverse data patterns while preserving core
features; the contextual-enhanced semantic refinement (CSR) module builds a
context dictionary to integrate into image representations, which boosts the
model's robustness in various scenarios; and the prototypical alignment (PA)
module reduces the gap between image representations and class prototypes,
amplifying feature distances for known and unknown classes. Experimental
results from two datasets verified that ProtoConNet enhances the effectiveness
of representation learning in few-shot scenarios and identifies open-set
samples, making it superior to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在行人意图预测中常忽略动态交通信号和场景信息，而这对自动驾驶车辆的安全导航至关重要。

Method: TA-STGCN通过整合动态交通信号状态和边界框大小作为关键特征，捕捉复杂城市环境中的时空依赖性。

Result: 在PIE数据集上，TA-STGCN比基线模型准确率提高了4.75%。

Conclusion: TA-STGCN有效提升了行人意图预测的准确性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention estimation is crucial for the safe navigation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and hence attracts a lot of research attention.
However, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic
signals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world
applications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph
Convolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states
(Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach
introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box
size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal
dependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing
methods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy
compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行人监测系统中因数据不足而难以应对挑战性条件的问题。

Method: 利用CARLA模拟器和动态视觉传感器生成SEPose数据集，包含近350K标注行人姿态关键点。

Result: 在真实事件数据上验证了SEPose的模拟到现实泛化能力。

Conclusion: SEPose为事件传感器在行人监测中的应用提供了有效的数据支持。

Abstract: Event-based sensors have emerged as a promising solution for addressing
challenging conditions in pedestrian and traffic monitoring systems. Their
low-latency and high dynamic range allow for improved response time in
safety-critical situations caused by distracted walking or other unusual
movements. However, the availability of data covering such scenarios remains
limited. To address this gap, we present SEPose -- a comprehensive synthetic
event-based human pose estimation dataset for fixed pedestrian perception
generated using dynamic vision sensors in the CARLA simulator. With nearly 350K
annotated pedestrians with body pose keypoints from the perspective of fixed
traffic cameras, SEPose is a comprehensive synthetic multi-person pose
estimation dataset that spans busy and light crowds and traffic across diverse
lighting and weather conditions in 4-way intersections in urban, suburban, and
rural environments. We train existing state-of-the-art models such as RVT and
YOLOv8 on our dataset and evaluate them on real event-based data to demonstrate
the sim-to-real generalization capabilities of the proposed dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种关系感知解耦学习（RaDL）框架，用于解决文本到图像（T2I）模型中多实例生成时的关系差异和属性泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多实例图像生成中难以处理实例间的关系差异和多个属性的泄漏问题。

Method: RaDL通过可学习参数增强实例特定属性，并利用从全局提示中提取的动作动词，通过关系注意力生成关系感知的图像特征。

Result: 在COCO-Position、COCO-MIG和DrawBench等基准测试中，RaDL在位置准确性、多属性考虑和实例关系方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RaDL是生成考虑多实例图像中实例关系和多个属性的有效解决方案。

Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively
generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial
challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of
individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy
and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper
proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL
enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and
generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing
action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on
benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that
RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in
positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships
between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating
images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each
instance within the multi-instance image.

TL;DR: 提出Dark-EvGS框架，结合事件相机和3D高斯泼溅技术，解决低光环境下多视角图像重建问题，并通过实验验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相机在低光环境下难以捕捉清晰多视角图像，事件相机和高斯泼溅技术虽能部分解决，但仍面临噪声、低质量和色彩不一致的挑战。

Method: 提出Dark-EvGS框架，采用三重监督学习和色彩匹配模块，确保重建帧的细节和色彩一致性，并创建首个真实数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低光条件下优于现有方法，成功实现高质量辐射场重建。

Conclusion: Dark-EvGS为低光环境下的多视角图像重建提供了有效解决方案，并展示了事件相机与高斯泼溅技术的潜力。

Abstract: In low-light environments, conventional cameras often struggle to capture
clear multi-view images of objects due to dynamic range limitations and motion
blur caused by long exposure. Event cameras, with their high-dynamic range and
high-speed properties, have the potential to mitigate these issues.
Additionally, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables radiance field reconstruction,
facilitating bright frame synthesis from multiple viewpoints in low-light
conditions. However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced
challenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and
the color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose
Dark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the
reconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera
trajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge,
granular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is
proposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames.
Furthermore, we introduce the first real-captured dataset for the event-guided
bright frame synthesis task via 3D GS-based radiance field reconstruction.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better results than existing
methods, conquering radiance field reconstruction under challenging low-light
conditions. The code and sample data are included in the supplementary
material.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Hyperphantasia基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的心理可视化能力，发现其与人类表现存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准主要评估被动视觉感知，缺乏对主动构建视觉模式以支持问题解决能力的评估，而心理可视化是人类认知的核心能力。

Method: 设计了包含四个程序生成任务的Hyperphantasia基准，分为三个难度级别，并评估了最先进模型的性能。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs在心理可视化能力上与人类存在显著差距，部分模型仅能识别视觉模式。

Conclusion: 心理可视化对当前MLLMs仍是一个开放挑战，强化学习可能有助于提升视觉模拟能力。

Abstract: Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual
representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a
vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite
the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current
benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight
into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to
support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill
in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical
trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative
simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic
benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs
through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated
and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model
performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of
humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement
learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that
while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns,
robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.

TL;DR: PPAR框架通过渐进式对齐和原型重加权，结合CLIP模型，提升了语义分割的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在原型对齐中的不足，如粗糙对齐、原型过拟合及忽略特征适应性差异。

Method: 定义OTP和VTP原型，采用渐进对齐策略和原型重加权机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: PPAR有效提升了语义分割的泛化能力，验证了其理论合理性。

Abstract: Generalizable semantic segmentation aims to perform well on unseen target
domains, a critical challenge due to real-world applications requiring high
generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as
domain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and
semantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First,
existing methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which
may hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source
batch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by
unrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally,
ignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable
semantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting
(PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model.
Specifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and
Visual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for
alignment. We then introduce a progressive alignment strategy that aligns
features in an easy-to-difficult manner, reducing domain gaps gradually.
Furthermore, we propose a prototypical reweighting mechanism that estimates the
reliability of source data and adjusts its contribution, mitigating the effect
of irrelevant or harmful features (i.e., reducing negative transfer). We also
provide a theoretical analysis showing the alignment between our method and
domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that PPAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness.

*Linwei Chen,Lin Gu,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于电路理论的频率动态注意力调制（FDAM）方法，通过注意力反转和频率动态缩放改进ViTs的频率响应，避免细节丢失，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs的注意力机制导致低频信息占主导，高频细节丢失，影响性能。

Method: 提出FDAM，包含注意力反转（AttInv）和频率动态缩放（FreqScale），动态调整频率响应。

Result: 在多种模型（如SegFormer、DeiT）和任务（语义分割、目标检测）中性能提升，并在遥感检测中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: FDAM有效解决了ViTs的频率消失问题，显著提升了视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision,
demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention
mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the
stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency
vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose
a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention
Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly
modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two
techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling
(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental
elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass
filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and
dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different
frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response
function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we
demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to
consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,
DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic
segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we
apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art
results in single-scale settings. The code is available at

Result: 实验显示MLLMs存在显著漏洞，攻击成功率（ASR）高，并揭示了模型对良性或违规内容的分类偏差。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更鲁棒和安全的MLLMs提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for content
moderation, yet their robustness in short-form video contexts remains
underexplored. Current safety evaluations often rely on unimodal attacks,
failing to address combined attack vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tri-modal safety of MLLMs. First,
we present the Short-Video Multimodal Adversarial (SVMA) dataset, comprising
diverse short-form videos with human-guided synthetic adversarial attacks.
Second, we propose ChimeraBreak, a novel tri-modal attack strategy that
simultaneously challenges visual, auditory, and semantic reasoning pathways.
Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant
vulnerabilities with high Attack Success Rates (ASR). Our findings uncover
distinct failure modes, showing model biases toward misclassifying benign or
policy-violating content. We assess results using LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrating
attack reasoning efficacy. Our dataset and findings provide crucial insights
for developing more robust and safe MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将掩码视为图像变形，缺乏理论分析，未能充分利用掩码重建在特征提取和表示学习中的潜力。

Method: 提出MaskTwins框架，通过互补掩码强制预测一致性，提取跨域不变特征。

Result: 实验表明MaskTwins在自然和生物图像分割中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MaskTwins无需单独预训练即可提取域不变特征，为域自适应分割提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency
regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely
treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect
the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked
reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing
feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe
masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and
theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses
superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on
this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA
framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training
pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across
disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked
in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods
in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the
significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features
without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for
domain-adaptive segmentation.

Motivation: 现有TTA方法在性能和效率之间难以平衡，要么调整文本提示开销大，要么手工视觉特征增强效果不稳定。

Method: GS-Bias引入全局偏差和空间偏差，直接添加到预训练模型的输出logits中，避免全反向传播，提高效率。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能，例如在跨数据集泛化和领域泛化上分别提升2.23%和2.72%，内存使用仅为TPT的6.5%。

Conclusion: GS-Bias以高效的方式显著提升了TTA性能，为视觉语言模型的零样本泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time adaptation (TTA) for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have garnered increasing attention, particularly through the use of
multiple augmented views of a single image to boost zero-shot generalization.
Unfortunately, existing methods fail to strike a satisfactory balance between
performance and efficiency, either due to excessive overhead of tuning text
prompts or unstable benefits from handcrafted, training-free visual feature
enhancement. In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias),
an efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases
during TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the
global bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning
consistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic
coherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is
worth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the
logits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full
backpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA
methods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving
state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets. For example, it achieves
a 2.23% improvement over TPT in cross-dataset generalization and a 2.72%
improvement in domain generalization, while requiring only 6.5% of TPT's memory
usage on ImageNet.

Conclusion: EC-Diff在生成质量和推理速度上取得平衡，适用于边缘-云协作框架。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have shown remarkable proficiency in image and video
synthesis. As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid
edge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast
inference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates
high-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage
refinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while
insufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge
model output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates
cloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the
optimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality.
Specifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud
inference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud
inference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy
search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise
approximation and edge model switching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly enhances generation quality compared to edge
inference, while achieving up to an average $2\times$ speedup in inference
compared to cloud inference. Video samples and source code are available at

Motivation: 现有方法将RGB域视为统一域，忽略了其多子域（如白天、夜晚、雾天场景）的特性，解耦域不变（DI）和域特定（DS）特征有助于RGB-IR域适应。

Conclusion: 通过解耦和耦合策略，SS-DC框架有效提升了RGB-IR域自适应目标检测的性能，验证了多子域特征解耦的重要性。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain
to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB
domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such
as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the
domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple
subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper
proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In
terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)
module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content
information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can
decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter
bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven
decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In
terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which
realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.
Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the
baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR
datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on
the FLIR-ADAS dataset.

Motivation: 现有无监督部件发现方法在跨类别和场景中缺乏鲁棒性，限制了应用范围。

Method: MPAE通过掩码自编码器学习部件描述符和特征图，利用局部特征与描述符的相似性填充掩码区域，从而对齐部件形状。

Result: MPAE在多种类别和场景中鲁棒地发现了与实际形状匹配的部件，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MPAE为无监督部件发现提供了一种更有效的范式，能够应对遮挡和跨类别部件相似性等挑战。

Abstract: Part-level features are crucial for image understanding, but few studies
focus on them because of the lack of fine-grained labels. Although unsupervised
part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot
maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts
their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more
effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part
Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map
from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the
original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part
descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.
By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become
better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from
unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that
closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,
several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to
identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an
unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges
posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple
categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly
discovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios. The code is
available at the project https://github.com/Jiahao-UTS/MPAE.

Conclusion: IICMVNCD在多视图NCD中表现优越，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which
aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known
classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,
existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on
single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view
data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their
reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in
unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors
such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided
Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to
explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view
level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel
classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into
view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices
capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor
matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,
we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of
novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted
fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known
classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel
class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本扩散管道，通过在不同风格专用模型的去噪过程中融合潜在空间，实现多风格的自然混合和区域控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在风格混合时难以控制区域性和平滑插值的问题。

Method: 在去噪过程中融合不同风格专用模型的潜在空间，利用低噪声潜在空间携带更强风格信息的特点，通过空间掩码实现区域风格控制，并结合ControlNet进行深度图条件化。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，该方法能根据给定掩码成功实现区域风格混合。

Conclusion: 该方法在多风格混合和区域控制方面表现优异，保留了各风格的保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have achieved remarkable results in
synthesizing diverse images from text prompts and can capture specific artistic
styles via style personalization. However, their entangled latent space and
lack of smooth interpolation make it difficult to apply distinct painting
techniques in a controlled, regional manner, often causing one style to
dominate. To overcome this, we propose a zero-shot diffusion pipeline that
naturally blends multiple styles by performing style composition on the
denoised latents predicted during the flow-matching denoising process of
separately trained, style-specialized models. We leverage the fact that
lower-noise latents carry stronger stylistic information and fuse them across
heterogeneous diffusion pipelines using spatial masks, enabling precise,
region-specific style control. This mechanism preserves the fidelity of each
individual style while allowing user-guided mixing. Furthermore, to ensure
structural coherence across different models, we incorporate depth-map
conditioning via ControlNet into the diffusion framework. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method successfully achieves
region-specific style mixing according to the given masks.

TL;DR: InstructFLIP是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的新型指令调优框架，通过文本指导增强跨域泛化能力，显著减少训练冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人脸防伪（FAS）中攻击类型语义理解不足和跨域训练冗余的问题。

Method: 结合VLM增强视觉输入感知，采用元域策略学习统一模型，并解耦指令为内容和风格两部分。

Result: 在准确率上超越SOTA模型，显著减少跨域训练冗余。

Conclusion: InstructFLIP通过文本指导和元域策略有效提升了FAS的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand
diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain
generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic
understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We
address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the
perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain
strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple
domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that
leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on
a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions
into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on
the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider
variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA
models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across
diverse domains in FAS. Project website is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无需初始位姿先验的全局定位问题。

Method: 利用2D图像与3D场景表示的语义关系，通过多层级位姿回归策略和语义全局检索算法逐步估计和优化位姿。

Result: 在12scenes和7scenes数据集上表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SGLoc在无初始位姿先验的情况下展示了出色的全局定位能力。

Abstract: We propose SGLoc, a novel localization system that directly regresses camera
poses from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation by leveraging semantic
information. Our method utilizes the semantic relationship between 2D image and
3D scene representation to estimate the 6DoF pose without prior pose
information. In this system, we introduce a multi-level pose regression
strategy that progressively estimates and refines the pose of query image from
the global 3DGS map, without requiring initial pose priors. Moreover, we
introduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes
correspondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted
scene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation,
we align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby
obtaining a coarse pose estimation. Subsequently, we refine the coarse pose by
iteratively optimizing the difference between the query image and the rendered
image from 3DGS. Our SGLoc demonstrates superior performance over baselines on
12scenes and 7scenes datasets, showing excellent capabilities in global
localization without initial pose prior. Code will be available at

TL;DR: ID-EA是一种新框架，通过ID驱动的增强器和适配器，改进文本到图像扩散模型中的身份一致性，显著提升个性化肖像生成的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Textual Inversion方法在个性化肖像生成中难以保持面部身份一致性，原因是文本与视觉嵌入空间在身份语义上的不对齐。

Method: ID-EA包含ID-Enhancer和ID-Adapter：前者通过文本ID锚点增强视觉身份嵌入，后者调整预训练UNet模型的交叉注意力模块以保持身份。

Result: ID-EA在身份保持指标上显著优于现有方法，且计算效率高，生成速度比现有方法快约15倍。

Conclusion: ID-EA通过改进文本与视觉嵌入的对齐，有效解决了身份一致性问题，为个性化肖像生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, personalized portrait generation with a text-to-image diffusion
model has significantly advanced with Textual Inversion, emerging as a
promising approach for creating high-fidelity personalized images. Despite its
potential, current Textual Inversion methods struggle to maintain consistent
facial identity due to semantic misalignments between textual and visual
embedding spaces regarding identity. We introduce ID-EA, a novel framework that
guides text embeddings to align with visual identity embeddings, thereby
improving identity preservation in a personalized generation. ID-EA comprises
two key components: the ID-driven Enhancer (ID-Enhancer) and the ID-conditioned
Adapter (ID-Adapter). First, the ID-Enhancer integrates identity embeddings
with a textual ID anchor, refining visual identity embeddings derived from a
face recognition model using representative text embeddings. Then, the
ID-Adapter leverages the identity-enhanced embedding to adapt the text
condition, ensuring identity preservation by adjusting the cross-attention
module in the pre-trained UNet model. This process encourages the text features
to find the most related visual clues across the foreground snippets. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that ID-EA substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation metrics while
achieving remarkable computational efficiency, generating personalized
portraits approximately 15 times faster than existing approaches.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中，运动预测对安全性至关重要。现有数据驱动方法直接预测轨迹，缺乏对行为意图的显式建模。

Method: 采用逆强化学习推理行为意图，结合查询中心范式聚合场景特征，通过分层解码器生成轨迹及其概率。

Result: 在Argoverse和nuScenes数据集上表现优异，显著提升了预测置信度。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模行为意图，该方法在运动预测任务中取得了竞争性表现。

Abstract: Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant
challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly
predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,
advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly
incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.
To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention
reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a
unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through
a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,
a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within
the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform
policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing
valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a
hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state
space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their
associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse
and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SAMST通过结合大模型的泛化能力与小模型的训练效率，成功解决了遥感语义分割中标注数据不足的挑战。

Abstract: Public remote sensing datasets often face limitations in universality due to
resolution variability and inconsistent land cover category definitions. To
harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a
semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary
detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components:
supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and
a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three
modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation
Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a
Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the
generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small
models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model
performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and
feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges
posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征空间结构特性的对抗性人脸生成方法，无需迭代优化，仅需少量查询即可高效攻击人脸识别系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性攻击对人脸识别系统构成严重威胁，现有方法依赖迭代优化或迁移性，效率低且不适用于商业系统。

Method: 利用特征空间中共享属性的子球面结构，生成视觉不同但被识别为目标身份的对抗性人脸。

Result: 仅需100张人脸图像的非自适应查询，对AWS CompareFaces API的成功率超过93%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且灵活，能生成具有特定属性的对抗性人脸，适用于商业系统攻击。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security
and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity
verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating
adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet
recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based
approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method
leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure
out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an
attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both
non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the
need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which
have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs
are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting
of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against
AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many
existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately
produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting
high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with
precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from
imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality
datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and
expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning)
framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby
enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate
our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object
detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of
AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous
annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally,
we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of
VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high
performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its
potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale
production datasets in autonomous driving.

Abstract: While 3D facial animation has made impressive progress, challenges still
exist in realizing fine-grained stylized 3D facial expression manipulation due
to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we introduce the
AUBlendSet, a 3D facial dataset based on AU-Blendshape representation for
fine-grained facial expression manipulation across identities. AUBlendSet is a
blendshape data collection based on 32 standard facial action units (AUs)
across 500 identities, along with an additional set of facial postures
annotated with detailed AUs. Based on AUBlendSet, we propose AUBlendNet to
learn AU-Blendshape basis vectors for different character styles. AUBlendNet
predicts, in parallel, the AU-Blendshape basis vectors of the corresponding
style for a given identity mesh, thereby achieving stylized 3D emotional facial
manipulation. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of AUBlendSet and
AUBlendNet through tasks such as stylized facial expression manipulation,
speech-driven emotional facial animation, and emotion recognition data
augmentation. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
demonstrate the potential and importance of AUBlendSet and AUBlendNet in 3D
facial animation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, AUBlendSet is the first
dataset, and AUBlendNet is the first network for continuous 3D facial
expression manipulation for any identity through facial AUs. Our source code is

Conclusion: 该方法通过小波变换和特征空间解耦，有效提升了低光图像增强的性能。

Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement
methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This
leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making
the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper
proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature
space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet
transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and
high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by
adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through
multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature
space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and
multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo
low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to
improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided
cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency
branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting
valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the
high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is
proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset
consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform
illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate
that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while
effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are
publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git.

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model to encode and
decode brain activity in response to naturalistic stimuli using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Leveraging temporally correlated input
from consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our
architecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap
between natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts
activity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction
of corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate
brain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find
that the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform
area, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex
recognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as
edges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with
the decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in
all, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual
processing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such
as the one proposed in this paper.

multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and
computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D
reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and
image processing with the integration of computer scientists into
multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in
recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for
their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal

successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable
cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling
(SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura
Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice
on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy
to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods
allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles
while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within
affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that
preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study
improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic
excellence in cultural heritage protection. The suggested approaches advance
the field into an era of unmatched efficiency and aesthetic quality while
carefully upholding the delicate equilibrium between tradition and innovation.

Abstract: High-quality open-source datasets have emerged as a pivotal catalyst driving
the swift advancement of deep learning, while facing the looming threat of
potential exploitation. Protecting these datasets is of paramount importance
for the interests of their owners. The verification of dataset ownership has
evolved into a crucial approach in this domain; however, existing verification
techniques are predominantly tailored to supervised models and contrastive
pre-trained models, rendering them ill-suited for direct application to the
increasingly prevalent masked models. In this work, we introduce the inaugural
methodology addressing this critical, yet unresolved challenge, termed Dataset
Ownership Verification for Masked Modeling (DOV4MM). The central objective is
to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box model has been pre-trained on a
particular unlabeled dataset, thereby assisting dataset owners in safeguarding
their rights. DOV4MM is grounded in our empirical observation that when a model
is pre-trained on the target dataset, the difficulty of reconstructing masked
information within the embedding space exhibits a marked contrast to models not
pre-trained on that dataset. We validated the efficacy of DOV4MM through ten
masked image models on ImageNet-1K and four masked language models on
WikiText-103. The results demonstrate that DOV4MM rejects the null hypothesis,
with a $p$-value considerably below 0.05, surpassing all prior approaches. Code

Abstract: Air pollutants pose a significant threat to the environment and human health,
thus forecasting accurate pollutant concentrations is essential for pollution
warnings and policy-making. Existing studies predominantly focus on
single-pollutant forecasting, neglecting the interactions among different
pollutants and their diverse spatial responses. To address the practical needs
of forecasting multivariate air pollutants, we propose MultiVariate
AutoRegressive air pollutants forecasting model (MVAR), which reduces the
dependency on long-time-window inputs and boosts the data utilization
efficiency. We also design the Multivariate Autoregressive Training Paradigm,
enabling MVAR to achieve 120-hour long-term sequential forecasting.
Additionally, MVAR develops Meteorological Coupled Spatial Transformer block,
enabling the flexible coupling of AI-based meteorological forecasts while
learning the interactions among pollutants and their diverse spatial responses.
As for the lack of standardized datasets in air pollutants forecasting, we
construct a comprehensive dataset covering 6 major pollutants across 75 cities
in North China from 2018 to 2023, including ERA5 reanalysis data and FuXi-2.0
forecast data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and validate the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture.

Abstract: With the growing need for diverse and scalable data in indoor scene tasks,
such as question answering and dense captioning, we propose 3D-MoRe, a novel
paradigm designed to generate large-scale 3D-language datasets by leveraging
the strengths of foundational models. The framework integrates key components,
including multi-modal embedding, cross-modal interaction, and a language model
decoder, to process natural language instructions and 3D scene data. This
approach facilitates enhanced reasoning and response generation in complex 3D
environments. Using the ScanNet 3D scene dataset, along with text annotations
from ScanQA and ScanRefer, 3D-MoRe generates 62,000 question-answer (QA) pairs
and 73,000 object descriptions across 1,513 scenes. We also employ various data
augmentation techniques and implement semantic filtering to ensure high-quality
data. Experiments on ScanQA demonstrate that 3D-MoRe significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with the CIDEr score improving by 2.15\%.
Similarly, on ScanRefer, our approach achieves a notable increase in CIDEr@0.5
by 1.84\%, highlighting its effectiveness in both tasks. Our code and generated
datasets will be publicly released to benefit the community, and both can be
accessed on the https://3D-MoRe.github.io.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的模型，利用出生24小时内的胸部X光片预测极低出生体重婴儿的支气管肺发育不良（BPD）结局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPD是一种常见的慢性肺病，预防干预措施可能带来严重风险，因此早期预测BPD结局至关重要。

Method: 使用ResNet-50模型，结合渐进层冻结、CutMix增强和线性探测技术，对163名极低出生体重婴儿的胸部X光片进行分析。

Result: 最佳模型在预测中重度BPD时的AUROC为0.78，平衡准确率为0.69，F1分数为0.67。

Conclusion: 研究表明，领域特定的预训练结合渐进冻结和线性探测技术，能够高效且准确地预测BPD结局。

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

deployment, enabling machine learning engineers to easily use it for their
specific setup with custom models, datasets, and backbones. At the same time,
it offers the flexibility and extensibility researchers need to develop and

Result: 在四个基准测试中超越现有最优模型。

Conclusion: MS-DETR通过运动-语义特征的统一学习，显著提升了任务性能。

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) aim to pinpoint
specific moments and assess clip-wise relevance based on the text query. While
DETR-based joint frameworks have made significant strides, there remains
untapped potential in harnessing the intricate relationships between temporal
motion and spatial semantics within video content. In this paper, we propose
the Motion-Semantics DETR (MS-DETR), a framework that captures rich
motion-semantics features through unified learning for MR/HD tasks. The encoder
first explicitly models disentangled intra-modal correlations within motion and
semantics dimensions, guided by the given text queries. Subsequently, the
decoder utilizes the task-wise correlation across temporal motion and spatial
semantics dimensions to enable precise query-guided localization for MR and
refined highlight boundary delineation for HD. Furthermore, we observe the
inherent sparsity dilemma within the motion and semantics dimensions of MR/HD
datasets. To address this issue, we enrich the corpus from both dimensions by
generation strategies and propose contrastive denoising learning to ensure the
above components learn robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments on four
MR/HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models by a margin. Our code is available at

Motivation: 研究扩散模型成功的关键在于输入条件表示，理想表示应提升样本保真度、易于生成且具有组合性。

Method: 引入离散潜在码（DLC），一种基于自监督学习的图像表示，通过扩散模型训练提升生成质量。

Result: DLC在ImageNet上实现无条件图像生成的新SOTA，并能生成超出训练分布的样本。

Conclusion: DLC为扩散模型提供高效、组合性强的条件表示，拓展了生成能力。

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is,
for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples
outside of the image generator training distribution.

Motivation: 解决无人机视角下小型多目标跟踪的三大挑战：目标外观特征稀缺、相机与目标运动复杂纠缠、以及密集群体行为导致的遮挡和身份模糊。

Method: 采用跟踪-检测范式，提出SliceTrain训练增强框架优化小目标检测，并设计独立于外观的跟踪器，结合运动方向维护和自适应相似性度量。

Result: 在SMOT4SB公开测试集上达到SO-HOTA分数55.205，验证了方法的有效性和先进性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂现实SMOT问题中表现出色，代码将开源。

Abstract: Tracking small, agile multi-objects (SMOT), such as birds, from an Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective is a highly challenging computer vision task.
The difficulty stems from three main sources: the extreme scarcity of target
appearance features, the complex motion entanglement caused by the combined
dynamics of the camera and the targets themselves, and the frequent occlusions
and identity ambiguity arising from dense flocking behavior. This paper details
our championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 "Finding Birds" Small
Multi-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the
tracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection
and association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training
enhancement framework named \textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the
synergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic
augmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for
small objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we
designed a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance
information. By integrating a \textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)}
mechanism and an \textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \textbf{bounding
box expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can
stably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMOT4SB public test set, reaching
an SO-HOTA score of \textbf{55.205}, which fully validates the effectiveness
and advancement of our framework in solving complex real-world SMOT problems.

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet-100上分别达到91.40%、68.56%和78.65%的top-1分类准确率。

Conclusion: CueCo通过结合对比学习和聚类，为无监督视觉表示学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised
visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of
contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements,
CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations
within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and
a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the
query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features
apart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull
together features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our
method achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on
CIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18
backbone. By integrating contrastive learning with clustering, CueCo sets a new
direction for advancing unsupervised visual representation learning.

Motivation: 准确的车辆3D重建对车辆检查、预测性维护和城市规划至关重要，但现有方法依赖密集输入视角，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过选择性光度损失和DUSt3R架构改进高斯泼溅技术，结合深度图和姿态估计，从稀疏视角输入重建车辆。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个基准测试中表现优异，即使在输入受限条件下也能实现高质量重建。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of vehicles is vital for applications such as
vehicle inspection, predictive maintenance, and urban planning. Existing
methods like Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have shown
impressive results but remain limited by their reliance on dense input views,
which hinders real-world applicability. This paper addresses the challenge of
reconstructing vehicles from sparse-view inputs, leveraging depth maps and a
robust pose estimation architecture to synthesize novel views and augment
training data. Specifically, we enhance Gaussian Splatting by integrating a
selective photometric loss, applied only to high-confidence pixels, and
replacing standard Structure-from-Motion pipelines with the DUSt3R architecture
to improve camera pose estimation. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset
featuring both synthetic and real-world public transportation vehicles,
enabling extensive evaluation of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing the
method's ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions even under constrained
input conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIR方法仅关注目标图像检索，忽视了其他图像的相关性，导致假负例问题。

Result: 在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上达到最优性能，并与人类偏好高度一致。

Conclusion: QuRe有效解决了假负例问题，提升了检索质量和用户满意度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference
image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing
CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the
relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods
employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and
all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false
negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user
satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we
propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which
optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we
introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned
between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to
effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their
alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ
(HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond
target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves
state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting
the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset. The

Result: 模型在生成阴影图像方面表现优异，并成功应用于亚利桑那州坦佩市的实际路线规划。

Conclusion: 该研究为极端高温天气下的城市规划提供了参考，并展示了潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global
warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail
to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades
directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training
data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through
two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse
longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different
urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building
outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles
throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are
aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade
patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to
learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of
edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and
incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of
shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,
time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in
generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using
our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning
in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a
reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential
practical applications in the environment.

Conclusion: Med-OoD为医学分割提供了新思路，展示了OoD数据的潜力，鼓励重新思考其在学习范式中的作用。

Abstract: Biomedical segmentation networks easily suffer from the unexpected
misclassification between foreground and background objects when learning on
limited and imperfect medical datasets. Inspired by the strong power of
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data on other visual tasks, we propose a data-centric
framework, Med-OoD to address this issue by introducing OoD data supervision
into fully-supervised biomedical segmentation with none of the following needs:
(i) external data sources, (ii) feature regularization objectives, (iii)
additional annotations. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into
segmentation networks without any modification on the architectures. Extensive
experiments show that Med-OoD largely prevents various segmentation networks
from the pixel misclassification on medical images and achieves considerable
performance improvements on Lizard dataset. We also present an emerging
learning paradigm of training a medical segmentation network completely using
OoD data devoid of foreground class labels, surprisingly turning out 76.1% mIoU
as test result. We hope this learning paradigm will attract people to rethink
the roles of OoD data. Code is made available at

Conclusion: RadGazeIntent成功建模了放射科医生的意图驱动行为，为医学图像解读提供了新视角。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images.
A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may
be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to
locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models
fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we
introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this
behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it.
Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial
dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into
coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret
radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied
intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets
to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential
Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid
Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict
which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming
baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

Conclusion: LidarPainter在驾驶场景重建中实现了高保真度和实时性，支持多样化的风格扩展。

Abstract: Dynamic driving scene reconstruction is of great importance in fields like
digital twin system and autonomous driving simulation. However, unacceptable
degradation occurs when the view deviates from the input trajectory, leading to
corrupted background and vehicle models. To improve reconstruction quality on
novel trajectory, existing methods are subject to various limitations including
inconsistency, deformation, and time consumption. This paper proposes
LidarPainter, a one-step diffusion model that recovers consistent driving views
from sparse LiDAR condition and artifact-corrupted renderings in real-time,
enabling high-fidelity lane shifts in driving scene reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that LidarPainter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
speed, quality and resource efficiency, specifically 7 x faster than
StreetCrafter with only one fifth of GPU memory required. LidarPainter also
supports stylized generation using text prompts such as "foggy" and "night",
allowing for a diverse expansion of the existing asset library.

hierarchical scene graph with a Large Language Model for multistep reasoning.
This integration leverages inter-layer (e.g., room-to-object) and intra-layer
(e.g., object-to-object) connections, enhancing spatial contextual
understanding. We investigate the semantic and geometry accuracy of
hierarchical representation on Habitat Matterport 3D Semantic multi-floor
scenes. Our approach demonstrates efficient scene comprehension and robust
object grounding compared to existing methods. Overall OVIGo-3DHSG demonstrates
strong potential for applications requiring spatial reasoning and understanding

Conclusion: BSPF-ViT在降低计算成本的同时显著提升了ViT的性能，适用于各种ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved impressive results across various
vision tasks, yet its high computational cost limits practical applications.
Recent methods have aimed to reduce ViT's $O(n^2)$ complexity by pruning
unimportant tokens. However, these techniques often sacrifice accuracy by
independently pruning query (Q) and key (K) tokens, leading to performance
degradation due to overlooked token interactions. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel {\bf Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion} for
efficient ViT (BSPF-ViT) that optimizes the pruning of Q/K tokens jointly.
Unlike previous methods that consider only a single direction, our approach
evaluates each token and its neighbors to decide which tokens to retain by
taking token interaction into account. The retained tokens are compressed
through a similarity fusion step, preserving key information while reducing
computational costs. The shared weights of Q/K tokens create a symmetric
attention matrix, allowing pruning only the upper triangular part for speed up.
BSPF-ViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ViT methods at all pruning
levels, increasing ImageNet classification accuracy by 1.3% on DeiT-T and 2.0%
on DeiT-S, while reducing computational overhead by 50%. It achieves 40%
speedup with improved accuracy across various ViTs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合双边网格和MLP的BPAM框架，用于图像增强，解决了现有方法在非线性映射和局部变化处理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双边网格方法仅支持线性变换，而传统MLP方法无法处理局部变化，BPAM框架旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 通过生成包含MLP参数的双边网格，动态为每个像素分配独特的变换参数，并提出网格分解策略和通道指导图优化参数生成。

Result: 在公开数据集上，BPAM性能优于现有方法，同时保持实时处理能力。

Conclusion: BPAM框架有效结合了双边网格的空间建模能力和MLP的非线性映射能力，提升了图像增强效果。

Abstract: Deep learning-based bilateral grid processing has emerged as a promising
solution for image enhancement, inherently encoding spatial and intensity
information while enabling efficient full-resolution processing through slicing
operations. However, existing approaches are limited to linear affine
transformations, hindering their ability to model complex color relationships.
Meanwhile, while multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) excel at non-linear mappings,
traditional MLP-based methods employ globally shared parameters, which is hard
to deal with localized variations. To overcome these dual challenges, we
propose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)
framework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with
the non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids
containing MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique
transformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on
spatial coordinates and intensity values. In addition, we propose a novel grid
decomposition strategy that categorizes MLP parameters into distinct types
stored in separate subgrids. Multi-channel guidance maps are used to extract
category-specific parameters from corresponding subgrids, ensuring effective
utilization of color information during slicing while guiding precise parameter
generation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖昂贵的手动标注或自监督方法无法准确捕捉动态对象运动，导致渲染伪影。

Method: 结合局部感知B样条曲线和全局感知三角函数的学习运动模型，简化伪2D分割自动分解场景，动态高斯和双向时间可见性掩码表示对象。

Result: 在无标注方法中显著优于现有技术，与依赖标注的方法竞争。

Conclusion: AD-GS提供了一种高效且高质量的自监督驾驶场景渲染解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling and rendering dynamic urban driving scenes is crucial for
self-driving simulation. Current high-quality methods typically rely on costly
manual object tracklet annotations, while self-supervised approaches fail to
capture dynamic object motions accurately and decompose scenes properly,
resulting in rendering artifacts. We introduce AD-GS, a novel self-supervised
framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes from a
single log. At its core is a novel learnable motion model that integrates
locality-aware B-spline curves with global-aware trigonometric functions,
enabling flexible yet precise dynamic object modeling. Rather than requiring
comprehensive semantic labeling, AD-GS automatically segments scenes into
objects and background with the simplified pseudo 2D segmentation, representing
objects using dynamic Gaussians and bidirectional temporal visibility masks.
Further, our model incorporates visibility reasoning and physically rigid
regularization to enhance robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
our annotation-free model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
annotation-free methods and is competitive with annotation-dependent
approaches.

Conclusion: 为人体运动捕捉和重建流程中的姿态先验集成提供了概率基础。

Abstract: We introduce a principled, data-driven approach for modeling a neural prior
over human body poses using normalizing flows. Unlike heuristic or
low-expressivity alternatives, our method leverages RealNVP to learn a flexible
density over poses represented in the 6D rotation format. We address the
challenge of modeling distributions on the manifold of valid 6D rotations by
inverting the Gram-Schmidt process during training, enabling stable learning
while preserving downstream compatibility with rotation-based frameworks. Our
architecture and training pipeline are framework-agnostic and easily
reproducible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned prior through
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and we analyze its impact via
ablation studies. This work provides a sound probabilistic foundation for
integrating pose priors into human motion capture and reconstruction pipelines.

Motivation: 现有FGIR方法依赖预训练模型，限制了在资源受限环境中的适应性和任务特定架构的发展。

Method: 引入TGDA框架，结合数据感知增强和通过知识蒸馏的细粒度感知教师模型进行弱监督，设计了任务特定架构如LRNets和ViTFS。

Result: 在多个FGIR基准测试中，TGDA框架性能优于或匹配现有预训练方法，尤其在低分辨率输入下，LRNets提升精度23%，参数和计算量大幅减少。

Conclusion: TGDA展示了无需预训练的高效FGIR潜力，为细粒度视觉系统提供了更灵活的设计路径。

Abstract: Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar
sub-categories within a broader class, such as identifying bird species. While
most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets
like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained
environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures
tailored to the unique challenges of FGIR.
  In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by
demonstrating that high-performance FGIR systems can be trained entirely from
scratch. We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates
data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher
model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the
design of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for
low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for
efficient inference.
  Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings
involving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method
consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts. In
particular, in the low-resolution setting, LRNets trained with TGDA improve
accuracy by up to 23\% over prior methods while requiring up to 20.6x less
parameters, lower FLOPs, and significantly less training data. Similarly,
ViTFS-T can match the performance of a ViT B-16 pretrained on ImageNet-21k
while using 15.3x fewer trainable parameters and requiring orders of magnitudes
less data. These results highlight TGDA's potential as an adaptable alternative
to pretraining, paving the way for more efficient fine-grained vision systems.

Conclusion: 双集成框架有效提高了脑肿瘤分类的准确性，各组件对结果均有贡献。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the most reliable
tool for detecting tumors due to its capability to produce detailed images that
reveal their presence. However, the accuracy of diagnosis can be compromised
when human specialists evaluate these images. Factors such as fatigue, limited
expertise, and insufficient image detail can lead to errors. For example, small
tumors might go unnoticed, or overlap with healthy brain regions could result
in misidentification. To address these challenges and enhance diagnostic
precision, this study proposes a novel double ensembling framework, consisting
of ensembled pre-trained deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction and
ensembled fine-tuned hyperparameter machine learning (ML) models to efficiently
classify brain tumors. Specifically, our method includes extensive
preprocessing and augmentation, transfer learning concepts by utilizing various
pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and vision transformer networks
to extract deep features from brain MRI, and fine-tune hyperparameters of ML
classifiers. Our experiments utilized three different publicly available Kaggle
MRI brain tumor datasets to evaluate the pre-trained DL feature extractor
models, ML classifiers, and the effectiveness of an ensemble of deep features
along with an ensemble of ML classifiers for brain tumor classification. Our
results indicate that the proposed feature fusion and classifier fusion improve
upon the state of the art, with hyperparameter fine-tuning providing a
significant enhancement over the ensemble method. Additionally, we present an
ablation study to illustrate how each component contributes to accurate brain
tumor classification.

Result: 在AFHQv2、FFHQ和11k-hands数据集上，RODS检测到70%以上的幻觉样本并修正超过25%，且未引入新伪影。

Conclusion: RODS通过优化视角改进了扩散采样，显著减少了幻觉问题，同时保持了高效性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative
modeling, yet their sampling procedures remain vulnerable to hallucinations,
often stemming from inaccuracies in score approximation. In this work, we
reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce
RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that
detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the
loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively
adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at
minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands
demonstrate that RODS improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting
over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while
avoiding the introduction of new artifacts.

Method: 扩展了VQA数据集为DD-VQA+，引入属性驱动的混合LoRA策略、多粒度提示学习和伪造感知训练策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在文本伪造判断和分析中优于现有方法，准确率更高。

Conclusion: MGFFD-VLM框架通过改进数据集和训练策略，显著提升了伪造检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent studies have utilized visual large language models (VLMs) to answer
not only "Is this face a forgery?" but also "Why is the face a forgery?" These
studies introduced forgery-related attributes, such as forgery location and
type, to construct deepfake VQA datasets and train VLMs, achieving high
accuracy while providing human-understandable explanatory text descriptions.
However, these methods still have limitations. For example, they do not fully
leverage face quality-related attributes, which are often abnormal in forged
faces, and they lack effective training strategies for forgery-aware VLMs. In
this paper, we extend the VQA dataset to create DD-VQA+, which features a
richer set of attributes and a more diverse range of samples. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel forgery detection framework, MGFFD-VLM, which integrates an
Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy to enhance the capabilities of Visual
Large Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, our framework incorporates
Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning and a Forgery-Aware Training Strategy. By
transforming classification and forgery segmentation results into prompts, our
method not only improves forgery classification but also enhances
interpretability. To further boost detection performance, we design multiple
forgery-related auxiliary losses. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach surpasses existing methods in both text-based forgery judgment and
analysis, achieving superior accuracy.

Abstract: Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image
regions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical
imaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely
on discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that
generative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can
achieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior
assumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,
domain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms
domain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with
mIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings
highlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding
tasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM),
a novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify
regions of high certainty. BBM refines cross-attention maps, achieving even
greater localization accuracy. Our results establish generative approaches as a
more effective paradigm for phrase grounding in the medical imaging domain,
paving the way for more robust and interpretable applications in clinical
practice. The source code and model weights are available at

Conclusion: 研究为健身技能自动化分析提供了初步探索，未来有进一步优化的空间。

Abstract: Calisthenics is a fast-growing bodyweight discipline that consists of
different categories, one of which is focused on skills. Skills in calisthenics
encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The
evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration
of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by
segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist
athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video
understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is
rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics
skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step
towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics.
To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of
static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with
a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence
report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill
temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the
feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.

Conclusion: FADE为安全公平的生成建模设定了新标准，无需从头训练即可移除指定概念。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image generation capabilities,
but also pose risks in privacy and fairness by memorizing sensitive concepts or
perpetuating biases. We propose a novel \textbf{concept erasure} method for
text-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a
private individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative
repertoire. Our method, termed \textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion
Erasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial
objective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall
model fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach
minimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's
outputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity,
explicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves
state-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like
ESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality.
Notably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by
5--10\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to
validate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and
trajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance.
Our work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by
unlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Calisthenics skill classification is the computer vision task of inferring
the skill performed by an athlete from images, enabling automatic performance
assessment and personalized analytics. Traditional methods for calisthenics
skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the
position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification
algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose
estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long
inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such
approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a
direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth
estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive
human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and
YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background
rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy
increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification
accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods,
achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved
classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these
performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible
replacement of components, enabling future enhancements and adaptation to
real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces KeyDiff3D, a framework for unsupervised monocular 3D
keypoints estimation that accurately predicts 3D keypoints from a single image.
While previous methods rely on manual annotations or calibrated multi-view
images, both of which are expensive to collect, our method enables monocular 3D
keypoints estimation using only a collection of single-view images. To achieve
this, we leverage powerful geometric priors embedded in a pretrained multi-view
diffusion model. In our framework, this model generates multi-view images from
a single image, serving as a supervision signal to provide 3D geometric cues to
our model. We also use the diffusion model as a powerful 2D multi-view feature
extractor and construct 3D feature volumes from its intermediate
representations. This transforms implicit 3D priors learned by the diffusion
model into explicit 3D features. Beyond accurate keypoints estimation, we
further introduce a pipeline that enables manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model. Experimental results on diverse aspects and datasets,
including Human3.6M, Stanford Dogs, and several in-the-wild and out-of-domain
datasets, highlight the effectiveness of our method in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and its ability to enable manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model from a single image.

Abstract: Weed detection is a critical component of precision agriculture, facilitating
targeted herbicide application and reducing environmental impact. However,
deploying accurate object detection models on resource-limited platforms
remains challenging, particularly when differentiating visually similar weed
species commonly encountered in plant phenotyping applications. In this work,
we investigate Channel-wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative
Distillation (MGD) to enhance the performance of lightweight models for
real-time smart spraying systems. Utilizing YOLO11x as the teacher model and
YOLO11n as both reference and student, both CWD and MGD effectively transfer
knowledge from the teacher to the student model. Our experiments, conducted on
a real-world dataset comprising sugar beet crops and four weed types (Cirsium,
Convolvulus, Fallopia, and Echinochloa), consistently show increased AP50
across all classes. The distilled CWD student model achieves a notable
improvement of 2.5% and MGD achieves 1.9% in mAP50 over the baseline without
increasing model complexity. Additionally, we validate real-time deployment
feasibility by evaluating the student YOLO11n model on Jetson Orin Nano and
Raspberry Pi 5 embedded devices, performing five independent runs to evaluate
performance stability across random seeds. These findings confirm CWD and MGD
as an effective, efficient, and practical approach for improving deep
learning-based weed detection accuracy in precision agriculture and plant
phenotyping scenarios.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上验证了模型的有效性，性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Text-SemiSeg通过文本与视觉特征的交互，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is a crucial technique for
alleviating the high cost of data annotation. When labeled data is limited,
textual information can provide additional context to enhance visual semantic
understanding. However, research exploring the use of textual data to enhance
visual semantic embeddings in 3D medical imaging tasks remains scarce. In this
paper, we propose a novel text-driven multiplanar visual interaction framework
for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (termed Text-SemiSeg), which
consists of three main modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR),
Category-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation
(DCA). Specifically, TMR facilitates text-visual interaction through planar
mapping, thereby enhancing the category awareness of visual features. CSA
performs cross-modal semantic alignment between the text features with
introduced learnable variables and the intermediate layer of visual features.
DCA reduces the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data
through their interaction, thus improving the model's robustness. Finally,
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model effectively
enhances visual features with textual information and outperforms other
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/taozh2017/Text-SemiSeg.

Motivation: 开发可靠的人体监测系统需要多样化和具有挑战性的数据集，以全面评估模型性能。

Method: 提出两个数据集，包含丰富的边界框和类别标注，并在这些数据集上测试了RETMDET、YOLOX等先进目标检测架构。

Result: OD-VIRAT Large包含8.7百万标注实例，OD-VIRAT Tiny包含288,901标注实例，实验提供了这些模型在复杂条件下的性能分析。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更高效和鲁棒的目标检测架构奠定了基础，并提供了对现有模型性能的深入见解。

Abstract: Realistic human surveillance datasets are crucial for training and evaluating
computer vision models under real-world conditions, facilitating the
development of robust algorithms for human and human-interacting object
detection in complex environments. These datasets need to offer diverse and
challenging data to enable a comprehensive assessment of model performance and
the creation of more reliable surveillance systems for public safety. To this
end, we present two visual object detection benchmarks named OD-VIRAT Large and
OD-VIRAT Tiny, aiming at advancing visual understanding tasks in surveillance
imagery. The video sequences in both benchmarks cover 10 different scenes of
human surveillance recorded from significant height and distance. The proposed
benchmarks offer rich annotations of bounding boxes and categories, where
OD-VIRAT Large has 8.7 million annotated instances in 599,996 images and
OD-VIRAT Tiny has 288,901 annotated instances in 19,860 images. This work also
focuses on benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection architectures,
including RETMDET, YOLOX, RetinaNet, DETR, and Deformable-DETR on this object
detection-specific variant of VIRAT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first work to examine the performance of these recently published
state-of-the-art object detection architectures on realistic surveillance
imagery under challenging conditions such as complex backgrounds, occluded
objects, and small-scale objects. The proposed benchmarking and experimental
settings will help in providing insights concerning the performance of selected
object detection models and set the base for developing more efficient and
robust object detection architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数InterpIoU，通过插值框解决现有IoU损失函数在非重叠情况下的问题，并进一步提出Dynamic InterpIoU以动态调整插值系数，显著提升了小物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IoU损失函数在非重叠情况下不可导，且手工设计的几何惩罚项对框的形状、大小和分布敏感，导致优化效果不佳，尤其是对小物体检测。

Method: 提出InterpIoU，用插值框的IoU替代手工几何惩罚项，并通过Dynamic InterpIoU动态调整插值系数。

Result: 在COCO、VisDrone和PASCAL VOC数据集上，InterpIoU和Dynamic InterpIoU显著优于现有IoU损失函数，尤其是小物体检测。

Conclusion: InterpIoU和Dynamic InterpIoU有效解决了现有IoU损失函数的局限性，提升了检测性能，特别是对小物体检测。

Abstract: Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the
regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses
often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's
non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.
However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,
often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired
behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU
objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss
function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the
IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to
bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides
meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box
enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further
show that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing
geometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,
we introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation
coefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with
diverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC
show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses
across various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in
small object detection, confirming their effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级视频焦点调制网络DVFL-Net，通过知识蒸馏和时空特征调制，在保持高性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在视频识别中表现出色但计算成本高，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: DVFL-Net利用知识蒸馏和时空焦点调制，从大模型中提取知识并压缩为轻量级模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，平衡了性能和效率，适用于实时应用。

Conclusion: DVFL-Net是一种高效且实用的视频识别解决方案。

Abstract: The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from
traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based
architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at
capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage
self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain
computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,
we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which
distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a
compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net
utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to
significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.
We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal
focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the
Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate
DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it
against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).
Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of
forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in
achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating
lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical
solution for real-time HAR applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对文本密集图像的VQA任务，区域级描述能力对提取细粒度文本信息至关重要，DAM-QA旨在利用DAM的区域感知能力解决这一问题。

Method: DAM-QA引入多区域视图机制，聚合图像内容的区域级描述，以更有效地识别与文本相关的证据。

Result: 在六个VQA基准测试中，DAM-QA显著优于基线DAM，尤其在DocVQA上提升7+分，且参数更少，性能接近通用视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: DAM-QA展示了区域感知模型在文本密集VQA任务中的潜力，通过高效集成策略缩小与通用模型的差距。

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling,
particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is
capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or
objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment
supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is
beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in
challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the
fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct
answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored
evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware
capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning
over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that
aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more
effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements.
Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA
also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer
parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These
results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader
VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.

models, such as Depth Anything V2, to estimate object distances. A comparative
analysis of these models provides valuable insights into their accuracy,
efficiency, and robustness in real-world conditions. The system is evaluated in

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在跨模态理解中存在幻觉问题，现有方法成本高或引入数据分布不匹配。

Method: 提出SENTINEL框架，通过迭代采样、验证和分类构建高质量偏好数据，并使用上下文感知偏好损失（C-DPO）训练模型。

Result: SENTINEL将幻觉减少90%以上，在幻觉和通用能力基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SENTINEL通过早期干预和领域内学习有效解决幻觉问题，具有优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal
understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content
contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either
incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches
between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight:
hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and
propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL**
(**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain
pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human
annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference
pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence
through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying
sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use
context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build
context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a
context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning
at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental
results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to
the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both
hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its
superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are

Conclusion: SpatialTrackerV2通过联合学习几何和运动，实现了高效且高精度的3D点跟踪。

Abstract: We present SpatialTrackerV2, a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for
monocular videos. Going beyond modular pipelines built on off-the-shelf
components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections
between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a
high-performing and feedforward 3D point tracker. It decomposes world-space 3D
motion into scene geometry, camera ego-motion, and pixel-wise object motion,
with a fully differentiable and end-to-end architecture, allowing scalable
training across a wide range of datasets, including synthetic sequences, posed
RGB-D videos, and unlabeled in-the-wild footage. By learning geometry and
motion jointly from such heterogeneous data, SpatialTrackerV2 outperforms
existing 3D tracking methods by 30%, and matches the accuracy of leading
dynamic 3D reconstruction approaches while running 50$\times$ faster.

Result: CytoSAE发现形态学相关概念，验证其有效性，并在AML亚型分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: CytoSAE为医学影像提供可解释性工具，性能媲美现有技术，同时支持亚细胞级解释。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic
interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs
were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual
concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model.
While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools
for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the
applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder
which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE
generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow
cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we
validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which
CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling
the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at
the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML
subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance
comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the
sub-cellular level. Source code and model weights are available at

Abstract: 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation
primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded
modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models,
the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical
properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like
simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we
propose \textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset
generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we
present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically
annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material,
affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a
scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,
which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)
Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for
physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge
into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a
dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D
structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible
physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive
experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization
capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to
facilitate future research in generative physical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在文学评估中的表现，揭示其是否具备类似人类的主观评价特征，而非仅作为中性基准。

Method: 将十篇日本科幻短篇小说翻译成英文，由六种先进LLMs在七次独立会话中评估，使用主成分分析和聚类技术分析评价一致性和模式。

Result: 发现评价一致性差异显著（α范围1.00至0.35），识别出五种评价模式，且不同故事的评价方差差异高达4.5倍。TF-IDF分析确认每种模型有独特的评价词汇。

Conclusion: LLMs可能具备类似人类批评流派的个体评价特征，而非中性基准工具，其隐含的价值体系受RLHF影响。

Abstract: This study positions large language models (LLMs) as "subjective literary
critics" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary
assessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into
English and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent
sessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed
significant variations in evaluation consistency ({\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to
0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance
across stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming
distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session
within-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically
minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped
by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that
LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human
critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLMs的鲁棒性和敏感性，提出了改进Map-VQA性能的潜在方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven
researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g.,
bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual
question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily
focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic
categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce
MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three
map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning
topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple
MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against
one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact
of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs,
and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and
sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and
potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

Conclusion: PgM通过区分和优化单模态与配对模态特征，提升了多模态学习的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each
learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned
from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from
cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a
partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal
partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal
decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into
uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated
components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder
reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features.
PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and
paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and
paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different
learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further
highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize
the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and
tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

TL;DR: ExpliCIT-QA是一个多模态表格问答系统，通过模块化设计提供可解释的答案，并在TableVQA-Bench上验证了其透明性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端表格问答系统中可解释性不足的问题，适用于金融和医疗等敏感领域。

Method: 采用多模态表格理解、语言推理、自动代码生成、代码执行和自然语言解释的模块化设计。

Result: 在TableVQA-Bench上表现优于基线，提升了透明性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ExpliCIT-QA为敏感领域的表格问答系统提供了可审计的解决方案。

Abstract: We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for
tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling
complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a
modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a
Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images;
(2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural
language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation,
where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with
feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer;
and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was
computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all
intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final
answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the
explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on
the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We
demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the
door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where
auditing results are critical.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CRABS的方法，通过结合浅层语法分析和LLM，解决Python笔记本中信息流和依赖关系的理解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据科学和机器学习笔记本的复杂性和依赖性问题，直接重新执行笔记本往往不切实际，而现有LLM在理解笔记本时存在幻觉和长上下文挑战。

Method: CRABS方法结合浅层语法分析（如AST解析）和LLM的零样本学习，捕捉笔记本的上下界估计，并解决剩余歧义。

Result: 在50个Kaggle笔记本上测试，LLM成功解决了98%的歧义，CRABS在信息流和执行依赖识别上分别达到98%和99%的F1分数。

Conclusion: CRABS方法通过结合语法分析和LLM，显著提高了笔记本信息流和依赖关系的理解准确性。

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and
machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and
adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution
often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software
dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases
have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we
observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to
hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose
a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and
corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate
the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to
assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve
Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and
analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct
interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the
inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via
cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and
outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted
Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.
The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the
syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves
average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%
identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

Motivation: 研究旨在改进新闻文章中句子主观性检测的准确性，特别是在多语言和零样本设置下，以评估模型的泛化能力。

Method: 团队采用基于Transformer的模型（如mDeBERTaV3-base、ModernBERT-base和Llama3.2-1B），并通过集成情感分数（来自辅助模型）与句子表示来增强分类器性能。同时，针对类别不平衡问题，使用了决策阈值校准。

Result: 实验表明，情感特征的集成显著提升了性能，尤其是主观F1分数。团队在希腊语任务中取得了第一名（Macro F1 = 0.51）。

Conclusion: 通过结合情感特征和句子表示，该方法在多语言和零样本主观性检测任务中表现优异，展示了其泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: This paper presents AI Wizards' participation in the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab
Task 1: Subjectivity Detection in News Articles, classifying sentences as
subjective/objective in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings.
Training/development datasets were provided for Arabic, German, English,
Italian, and Bulgarian; final evaluation included additional unseen languages
(e.g., Greek, Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian) to assess generalization. Our
primary strategy enhanced transformer-based classifiers by integrating
sentiment scores, derived from an auxiliary model, with sentence
representations, aiming to improve upon standard fine-tuning. We explored this
sentiment-augmented architecture with mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base
(English), and Llama3.2-1B. To address class imbalance, prevalent across
languages, we employed decision threshold calibration optimized on the
development set. Our experiments show sentiment feature integration
significantly boosts performance, especially subjective F1 score. This
framework led to high rankings, notably 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).

Motivation: 研究旨在复现并调和Ortu等人、Yu、Merullo、Pavlick以及McDougall等人的三项近期研究，这些研究通过机制解释工具探讨了模型学习事实与矛盾上下文信息之间的竞争。

Method: 研究分析了注意力头强度与事实输出比例的关系，评估了关于注意力头抑制机制的竞争性假设，并探讨了这些注意力模式的领域特异性。

Result: 研究发现，促进事实输出的注意力头通过通用的复制抑制而非选择性反事实抑制实现其作用，且注意力头行为具有领域依赖性，较大模型表现出更专业和类别敏感的模式。

Conclusion: 注意力头通过通用机制而非选择性抑制处理竞争信息，且其行为受模型规模和领域影响。

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language
Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing
on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and
reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and
Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between
model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic
Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship
between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing
hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the
domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that
attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression
rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can
also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior
is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and
category-sensitive patterns.

Conclusion: 研究为印度语言识别提供了新数据集和强基线模型，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The language identification task is a crucial fundamental step in NLP. Often
it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as
multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and
answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language
identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed
environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that
exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many
Indian languages share the same script making the task even more challenging.
In this paper, we release a dataset of 230K sentences consisting of English and
all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers where
data in most languages are newly created. We also develop and release robust
baseline models using state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and deep
learning that can aid the research in this field. Our baseline models are
comparable to the state-of-the-art models for the language identification task.

Result: 代码和数学生成速度提升近5倍，通用聊天和知识任务提升2.5倍，且质量无损。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升生成效率，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential
nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed
and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the
direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla
autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to
realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple
subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a
masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted
from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original
LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a
lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from
the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including
a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated
tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens
quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method
achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained
models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves
general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any
loss in quality.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of personally identifiable information (PII) is central
to automated text anonymization. This paper investigates the effectiveness of
cross-domain model transfer, multi-domain data fusion, and sample-efficient

biographical texts, while medical domains resist incoming transfer. Fusion
benefits are domain-specific, and high-quality recognition is achievable with
only 10% of training data in low-specialization domains.

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and grammatical acceptability judgment
(COLA) are core tasks in natural language processing, sharing foundational
grammatical knowledge yet typically evolving independently. This paper
introduces COLA-GEC, a novel bidirectional framework that enhances both tasks
through mutual knowledge transfer. First, we augment grammatical acceptability

results on several multilingual benchmarks. Comprehensive error analysis
highlights remaining challenges, particularly in punctuation error correction,
providing insights for future improvements in grammatical modeling.

Result: 在CLOTH-F上表现稳定，在MCQ上P@1提升3.48-3.86%，尤其适用于多样化问题和跨域数据。

Conclusion: DualReward提供了一种灵活框架，有效平衡学习人类示例和生成高质量干扰项，适用于自动化测试生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces DualReward, a novel reinforcement learning framework
for automatic distractor generation in cloze tests. Unlike conventional
approaches that rely primarily on supervised learning or static generative
models, our method employs a dual reward structure with adaptive scaling that
differentiates between human-created gold standard distractors and
model-generated candidates. The framework dynamically adjusts reward signal
intensity based on model performance and confidence. We evaluate our approach
on both passage-level (CLOTH-F) and sentence-level (MCQ) cloze test datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results show that our adaptive reward scaling mechanism provides
modest but consistent benefits on homogeneous datasets (CLOTH-F) and more
substantial improvements (3.48-3.86% in P@1) on diverse, cross-domain data
(MCQ), suggesting its particular effectiveness for handling varied question
types and domains. Our work offers a flexible framework that effectively
balances learning from reliable human examples while exploring novel,
high-quality distractors for automated test generation.

TL;DR: 论文发现LLMs内部对有害性的理解与拒绝行为是两个独立的概念，并提出了一种新的安全机制（Latent Guard）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否真正理解有害性，而不仅仅是机械地拒绝指令。

Method: 通过识别有害性方向与拒绝方向的差异，分析LLMs的安全机制。

Result: 发现某些越狱方法通过减少拒绝信号而非改变有害性判断来绕过安全机制。

Conclusion: LLMs对有害性的内部理解比拒绝行为更稳健，为AI安全研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand
harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal
behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal
direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety
mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a
separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is
distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the
harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as
harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal
responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.
Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain
jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially
finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical
safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as
an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing
over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent
Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a
dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our
findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more
robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a
new perspective to study AI safety

Conclusion: 多语言指令跟随存在挑战，如关键词一致性和跨语言约束遵循，Marco-Bench-MIF为相关研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated
for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval,
are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine
translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual
contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to
a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages
with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic
constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and
cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in
prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through
comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1)
25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales
largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges,
and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus
localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction
following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional
constraint adherence across languages. Our Marco-Bench-MIF is available at

Motivation: 现有图表理解基准主要针对英语，限制了其全球适用性，因此需要开发多语言基准以促进全球包容性。

Method: 采用解耦管道，将图表数据与渲染代码分离，通过翻译数据和重用代码生成多语言图表，并利用先进的LLM翻译和严格质量控制。

Result: 实验显示，英语与其他语言（尤其是非拉丁文字的低资源语言）之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: PolyChartQA为推进全球包容性视觉语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating
data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly
English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global
audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale
multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and
26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is
built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code,
allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the
data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation
and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic
and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA
facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding.
Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal
a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially
low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for
advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CPU实现的BPE算法在GPU批量推理中效率低下，BlockBPE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BlockBPE通过消除Regex预分词步骤，实现高度并行化的标记合并，复杂度降至O(nd)。

Result: 在高批量推理任务中，BlockBPE的吞吐量比tiktoken高2倍，比HuggingFace Tokenizers高2.5倍。

Conclusion: BlockBPE显著提升了GPU批量推理的效率，尽管生成质量略有损失，但性能提升显著。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step in large language model
pipelines, yet widely-used implementations remain CPU-bound and suboptimal for
batch inference workflows on GPU. We present BlockBPE, a parallel GPU
implementation of byte-pair encoding (BPE) that achieves near linear-time
complexity under realistic assumptions and is optimized for high-throughput,
batch inference. Unlike existing Rust-based tokenizers such as HuggingFace
Tokenizers or OpenAI's tiktoken-whose runtimes are dominated by Regex
pre-tokenization and exhibit $O(n \log n)$ runtime-BlockBPE eliminates the
Regex pre-tokenization which leads to small loss in generation quality, but
enables highly parallelized token merges within thread blocks, reducing overall
complexity to $O(nd)$ where $d \ll n$. On high-batch inference workloads,
BlockBPE achieves up to 2x higher throughput than tiktoken and 2.5x over
HuggingFace Tokenizers.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖信息熵作为压缩指标，忽略了注意力关键令牌的重要性以及压缩过程中熵的变化。

Method: 提出DAC方法，动态整合熵和注意力信息，感知压缩过程中的熵变化。

Result: 在多个领域（如LongBench、GSM8K、BBH）的实验表明，DAC在各种任务和大型语言模型上均表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: DAC方法在任务无关提示压缩中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language
to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within
prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly
rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to
achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two
critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the
algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the
compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic
attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This
approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically
sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt
compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench,
GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial
improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling
evidence of its efficacy.

*Xinyu Wang,Vahid Partovi Nia,Peng Lu,Jerry Huang,Xiao-Wen Chang,Boxing Chen,Yufei Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的PoT量化框架，用于LLM权重，在极低精度下优于现有方法，并实现更快的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs需要大量计算资源，现有PoT量化在GPU上效率不足。

Method: 采用两步后训练算法：初始化量化尺度并校准优化。

Result: 在2-和3-bit格式下表现优于现有整数量化方法，GPU推理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 新型PoT量化框架在低精度和GPU效率上具有优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is
challenging due to the substantial computational resources required.
Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this
difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently
dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on
GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit
manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization
framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in
extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference
through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the
quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)
initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)
refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT
post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer
quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our
PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating
point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and
$1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

*Yi Zhao,Zuchao Li,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出IAM框架，通过利用不同规模LLMs间注意力矩阵的高相似性，优化计算和KV缓存使用，实现加速和资源节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在长上下文场景下资源消耗大，现有优化方法未充分利用外部信息。

Method: 分析注意力矩阵相似性，提出IAM框架，通过小规模与大规模LLMs间的注意力映射优化计算和KV缓存。

Result: IAM加速预填充15%，减少KV缓存使用22.1%，性能无明显损失，且与现有方法兼容。

Conclusion: IAM为提升LLM效率提供了通用且兼容的新工具。

Abstract: LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays,
especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing
inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within
the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We
identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs,
which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a
comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping
Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we
introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated
attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention
mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that
IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without
appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models
show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many
existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the
current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段框架，用于在低资源语言对中保留毒性的翻译，并以新加坡英语为例验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中，标准翻译系统难以处理低资源语言中的俚语、混合语和文化嵌入的有害内容标记，尤其是在毒性内容翻译方面。

Method: 1. 通过人工验证的少样本提示工程，筛选和排序新加坡英语-目标语言的例子；2. 通过直接和回译的语义相似性，优化模型-提示对。

Result: 定量人工评估证实了该框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了翻译质量，还支持低资源环境下的文化敏感内容审核和基准测试，强调了在现实应用中保留社会语言细微差别的重要性。

Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages
and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve
local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech.
Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional
challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize
offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage
framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed
Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt
engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target
examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize
model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic
similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation
confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving
translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural
LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in
low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP,
we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world
applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

Result: LLMs在图拓扑结构层面表现出高度一致的语言理解能力。

Conclusion: 研究为人类与AI协同学习策略提供了新见解，并验证了图结构分析的有效性。

Abstract: Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.
With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need
to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts
and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion
interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and
human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed
that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the
inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns,
particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely
on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the
conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This
study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into
nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic
meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye
fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit
high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological
structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into
effective human-AI co-learning strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索价值相似性在人工社会中是否像在人类社会中一样影响关系建立。

Method: 通过两个实验：初步实验评估LLM中价值的可控性；主实验生成具有特定价值的代理对并分析其信任和亲密感。

Result: 价值相似性高的代理对表现出更高的相互信任和亲密感。

Conclusion: LLM代理模拟可作为社会科学理论的有效测试平台，并有助于理解价值如何影响关系建立。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating
complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human
societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close
relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true
in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study
investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among
LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we
evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective
model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main
experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and
analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness
following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to
investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents
with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal
closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a
valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the
mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a
foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了简化对多义词定义完整性的影响，发现过度简化会降低定义质量，导致误解风险增加。通过微调模型，可以显著提升多义词定义的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同目标群体（如儿童或语言学习者）中提供准确的多义词定义时，简化可能导致关键信息丢失，引发误解。

Method: 使用两种新颖的多语言评估数据集，测试了多个LLM模型（如DeepSeek v3、Llama 4 Maverick等），并通过LLM-as-Judge和人工标注评估简化对定义质量的影响。

Result: 简化显著降低了定义的完整性，尤其是忽略了多义性。通过微调Llama 3.1 8B模型，多义词定义质量在所有提示类型中均得到显著提升。

Conclusion: 研究强调在教育NLP中需平衡简洁性与完整性，以确保为所有学习者提供可靠、上下文感知的定义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accurate word definitions and
explanations for any context. However, the scope of the definition changes for
different target groups, like children or language learners. This is especially
relevant for homonyms, words with multiple meanings, where oversimplification
might risk information loss by omitting key senses, potentially misleading
users who trust LLM outputs. We investigate how simplification impacts homonym
definition quality across three target groups: Normal, Simple, and ELI5. Using
two novel evaluation datasets spanning multiple languages, we test DeepSeek v3,
Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B via LLM-as-Judge
and human annotations. Our results show that simplification drastically
degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing the risk of
misunderstanding. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization
substantially improves homonym response quality across all prompt types. These
findings highlight the need to balance simplicity and completeness in
educational NLP to ensure reliable, context-aware definitions for all learners.

Abstract: This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in
neural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the
introduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the
properties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,
emphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It
proposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including
regularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to
stabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second
part focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency
by integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,
guided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents
smoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need
for labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active
learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and
computational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP
tasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform
traditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The
third part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning
to effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive
labeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak
supervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by
leveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations confirm significant gains in model accuracy,
adaptability, and robustness, especially in low-resource settings and dynamic
data environments.

Method: 测试包括多种任务，评估基于词形变化和隐喻语言使用的创造力。使用OCSAI工具自动评估答案的原创性、精细性和灵活性。

Result: LLMs在所有评估标准上优于人类，并在八项任务中的六项中表现更好。人类更倾向于扩展创造力，而LLMs偏向固定创造力。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言创造力方面表现出色，但人类和LLMs在创造力类型上存在差异。

Abstract: The following paper introduces a general linguistic creativity test for
humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). The test consists of various tasks
aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases
based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on
metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an
equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI
tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results
show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but
did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness
of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans
and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which
revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while
LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

Conclusion: BOOKCOREF填补了书籍规模共指消解评估的空白，揭示了当前模型在长文档中的性能不足，并鼓励未来研究改进。

Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks
containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long
texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length
and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when
co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap,
we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality
Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this
pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with
an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series
of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and
demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document
coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full
books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this
unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to
deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our
data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale
Coreference Resolution systems at https://github.com/sapienzanlp/bookcoref.

Motivation: 许多学生在数学学习中遇到困难，导致他们回避数学相关学科。研究旨在探索更有效的教学方法，以提升学生的数学学习体验。

Method: 采用组内设计，随机分配问题给大学生参与者，比较MEGA方法和传统CoT方法的效果。使用GSM8K和MATH数据集样本评估两种LLM（GPT4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet）。

Result: MEGA方法在两种数据集上均被学生认为更有利于学习，尤其在MATH数据集中表现显著优于CoT方法（47.5% vs 26.67%）。

Conclusion: MEGA方法在解释复杂数学问题时效果更佳，为数学教学提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined
methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3)
simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students'
Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach
Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students
struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects
despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal
processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal
pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)
method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after
randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.
Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade
School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)
datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a
manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were
used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer
4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for
capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the
MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even
much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH
dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.

Motivation: 解决现有文本增强技术在语义保存方面的不足，特别是在大规模或迭代生成时导致的冗余和不稳定性。

Method: 提出两个评估组件：可扩展性分析（衡量语义一致性）和IASR（评估递归释义中的语义漂移）。

Result: GPT-3.5 Turbo在语义保真度、多样性和生成效率上表现最佳；在BERTopic任务中，主题粒度提升400%且完全消除重叠。

Conclusion: 验证了所提框架在NLP实际应用中对LLM增强的结构化评估价值。

Abstract: Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity
in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings
where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation
can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing
techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during
large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability.
This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model
(LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability
Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases,
and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which
evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical
evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the
best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency.
Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced
few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic
granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings
validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of
LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

Motivation: 为生成语言模型提供可测试的高层次评估标准，特别是在文本理解能力方面。

Method: 采用三步评估框架（问题生成、回答、评分），使用多种语言和材料来源，结合自动和手动评估。

Result: 发现现有方法在问题质量评估和答案限制上存在问题，LLM在回答任务中表现尚可但受限。

Conclusion: 需要改进问题生成和答案限制的评估策略，LLM-as-a-Judge范式存在误判问题。

Abstract: ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable
high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models. Sensemaking is
one such shared task.
  In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out
of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1)
Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should
answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers,
all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.
  We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test
materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed
recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German,
Ukrainian, and Czech languages.
  This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2
Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for
Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a
fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual
evaluation.
  We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the
creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be
devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate
question sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined
overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input
texts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers,
our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm
erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up
questions as acceptable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合了词级和短语级融合的优势，提升了ASR模型在关键词识别上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端ASR模型在一般语音转录上表现良好，但在识别上下文相关关键词（如专有名词或用户特定实体）时表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合了词级和短语级融合的优势，并采用后融合策略将ASR的声学信息与LLM的上下文知识结合。

Result: 在中英文数据集上，该方法在关键词相关指标上达到了最先进的性能，同时保持了非关键词文本的高准确性。

Conclusion: 多粒度融合框架中的词级和短语级组件相互补充，显著提升了性能。代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown
impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to
accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or
user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the
textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level
fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that
enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own
limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly
leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large
Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines
ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing
fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while
preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level
components both contribute significantly to the performance gains,
complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.
  The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.

*Michael Carl,Takanori Mizowaki,Aishvarya Ray,Masaru Yamada,Devi Sri Bandaru,Xinyue Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了行为翻译风格空间（BTSS），用于描述翻译行为模式，并通过分析击键和注视数据揭示隐藏的认知结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究翻译行为背后的认知和情感过程，以更好地理解翻译的动态机制。

Method: 通过记录击键和注视数据，构建多层嵌入的BTSS，作为计算翻译代理的基础。

Result: BTSS能够模拟翻译过程中的情感、自动化行为和认知的时间动态。

Conclusion: BTSS为研究翻译行为提供了新视角，并为计算翻译代理的开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: The paper introduces a Behavioural Translation Style Space (BTSS) that
describes possible behavioural translation patterns. The suggested BTSS is
organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing
layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger
movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but
it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective
translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as
indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the
behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the
basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics
of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation
production.

### [136] [Infherno: End-to-end Agent-based FHIR Resource Synthesis from Free-form Clinical Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12261)
*Johann Frei,Nils Feldhus,Lisa Raithel,Roland Roller,Alexander Meyer,Frank Kramer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Infherno是一个基于LLM代理、代码执行和医疗术语数据库工具的端到端框架，旨在将自由形式的临床笔记转换为结构化FHIR资源，解决现有方法的泛化性和结构一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如模块化规则系统或指令调优的LLM）在泛化性和结构一致性上表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用LLM代理、代码执行和医疗术语数据库工具的端到端框架，确保符合FHIR文档模式。

Result: Infherno在从非结构化文本预测FHIR资源方面表现优异，接近人类基准水平。

Conclusion: Infherno支持临床数据集成和跨机构互操作性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard
has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between
complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from
free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular,
rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding.
Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural
inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code
execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues.
Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document
schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources
from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and
synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data
integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

*Reuben Smit,Retief Louw,Herman Kamper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探索了一种在低资源环境下无需ASR的孤立单词阅读评估方法，通过对比儿童语音与少量成人参考模板，使用自监督学习模型的中间层编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源环境下儿童语音评估的挑战，利用自监督学习模型的潜力。

Method: 采用few-shot方法，将输入儿童语音与成人参考模板比较，使用SSL模型的中间层编码，并探索离散化SSL特征和模板的重心平均。

Result: 在理想化实验中，成人语音表现良好，但儿童语音输入效果显著下降，即使使用儿童模板。

Conclusion: 尽管SSL表示在低资源语音任务中表现良好，但在few-shot分类系统中处理儿童数据时存在局限性。

Abstract: We explore an ASR-free method for isolated word reading assessment in
low-resource settings. Our few-shot approach compares input child speech to a
small set of adult-provided reference templates. Inputs and templates are
encoded using intermediate layers from large self-supervised learned (SSL)
models. Using an Afrikaans child speech benchmark, we investigate design
options such as discretising SSL features and barycentre averaging of the
templates. Idealised experiments show reasonable performance for adults, but a
substantial drop for child speech input, even with child templates. Despite the
success of employing SSL representations in low-resource speech tasks, our work
highlights the limitations of SSL representations for processing child data
when used in a few-shot classification system.

*Yikang Liu,Wanyang Zhang,Yiming Wang,Jialong Tang,Pei Zhang,Baosong Yang,Fei Huang,Rui Wang,Hai Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为T-index的定量测量方法，用于评估翻译文本的翻译特性（translationese），并通过对比微调的语言模型计算。实验表明T-index在跨域设置中具有普适性，且与人类判断高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译质量评估指标（如BLEU和COMET）未能涵盖翻译特性（translationese），因此需要一种新的定量测量方法。

Method: 使用两个对比微调的语言模型（0.5B参数）计算T-index，并在合成数据集和真实翻译数据集上进行评估。

Result: T-index能够有效捕捉翻译特性，与人类标注的翻译特性高度相关（Pearson's r = 0.568），且与现有MT质量评估指标相关性低。

Conclusion: T-index是一种稳健且高效的翻译特性测量方法，可作为现有MT质量评估指标的补充。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first quantitative measure for translationese
-- the translationese-index (T-index) for graded and generalizable measurement
of translationese, computed from the likelihood ratios of two contrastively
fine-tuned language models (LMs). We use a synthesized dataset and a dataset
with translations in the wild to evaluate T-index's generalizability in
cross-domain settings and its validity against human judgments. Our results
show that T-index is both robust and efficient. T-index scored by two 0.5B LMs
fine-tuned on only 1-5k pairs of synthetic data can well capture translationese
in the wild. We find that the relative differences in T-indices between
translations can well predict pairwise translationese annotations obtained from
human annotators; and the absolute values of T-indices correlate well with
human ratings of degrees of translationese (Pearson's $r = 0.568$).
Additionally, the correlation between T-index and existing machine translation
(MT) quality estimation (QE) metrics such as BLEU and COMET is low, suggesting
that T-index is not covered by these metrics and can serve as a complementary
metric in MT QE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个文本异常检测的基准测试，通过多种预训练语言模型的嵌入和多领域数据集，系统评估了嵌入质量对异常检测效果的影响，并开源了工具包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本异常检测方法缺乏标准化和全面的基准测试，限制了方法的比较和创新。

Method: 利用多种预训练语言模型的嵌入和多领域数据集，结合多种评估指标（如AUROC、AUPRC），系统评估嵌入质量对异常检测的影响。

Result: 研究发现嵌入质量对异常检测效果至关重要，且深度学习模型在LLM嵌入下并未优于传统浅层算法（如KNN、Isolation Forest）。

Conclusion: 该工作为未来文本异常检测研究提供了基准和工具，支持高效模型评估和选择。

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing
(NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation
identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant
advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the
absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the
existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and
development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive
empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,
leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide
array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of
embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language
models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI
(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,
scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).
Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality
significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based
approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow
algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived
embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in
cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid
model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical
applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes
all embeddings from different models and code at
https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work
provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly
detection systems.

TL;DR: 论文评估了现有代码大语言模型（LLMs）在VHDL代码生成和摘要任务中的表现，发现其性能不足，并提出了一种名为Chain-of-Descriptions（CoDes）的新方法以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用代码任务中表现优异，但在硬件描述语言（如VHDL）领域的研究较少，存在性能不足的问题。

Method: 提出CoDes方法，通过生成中间描述步骤并结合原始输入提示来改进LLMs的输出。

Result: 实验表明，CoDes方法在VHDL代码生成和摘要任务中显著优于标准提示策略。

Conclusion: CoDes不仅提升了VHDL任务的质量，还为未来改进代码LLMs提供了框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks
and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm
of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,
despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a
dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware
description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization
using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,
an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally
equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these
models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their
suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose
Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of
LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves
generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem
statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These
steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or
code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our
experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the
standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This
method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization
but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs
for VHDL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现阿尔茨海默病（AD）语音感知中存在性别偏见，男性语音更易被识别为AD，尤其在中文语音中。声学分析显示男性语音的shimmer值与AD感知显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨性别偏见在AD语音感知中的影响，以改进AD检测模型的开发。

Method: 通过16名中文听众对中文和希腊语语音的感知实验，结合声学分析。

Result: 男性语音更频繁被识别为AD，shimmer值与AD感知显著相关，语言对AD感知无显著影响。

Conclusion: 性别偏见在AD语音感知中起关键作用，需在模型开发中加以解决，并进一步验证跨语言性能。

Abstract: Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced
by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a
gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a
perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese
and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified
as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic
analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly
associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant
negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a
significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role
of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of
addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for
further research to validate model performance across different linguistic
contexts.

*Ana Davila,Jacinto Colan,Yasuhisa Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体辩论框架，用于提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在模糊用户请求中的检测和解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在处理模糊用户请求时存在挑战，需要一种方法来增强其能力。

Method: 采用三种LLM架构（Llama3-8B、Gemma2-9B和Mistral-7B变体）和一个包含多样模糊性的数据集，设计多智能体辩论框架。

Result: 辩论框架显著提升了Llama3-8B和Mistral-7B的性能，Mistral-7B主导的辩论成功率达到76.7%，尤其在复杂模糊性和高效共识方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 辩论框架是增强LLM能力的有效方法，为开发更鲁棒和自适应的语言理解系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural
interactions with complex systems. However, they face challenges such as
ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to
enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The
framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and
Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate
framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B
variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving
a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex
ambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model
responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate
framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This
work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language
understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved
clarity in interactive systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了语言模型内部激活是否能用于检测算术错误，通过简单探针解码隐藏状态，训练轻量级错误检测器，并扩展到复杂任务，最终实现选择性重新提示以提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型内部激活是否能有效检测算术错误，为模型自我修正提供轻量级解决方案。

Method: 从3位数加法控制实验开始，训练探针解码隐藏状态；扩展到GSM8K问题，训练错误检测器并选择性重新提示。

Result: 探针能准确解码模型预测和正确答案，错误检测器准确率超90%；选择性重新提示提高了任务准确性。

Conclusion: 算术错误可通过内部激活预测，简单探针为轻量级自我修正提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to
detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit
addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's
predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of
whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight
error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then
extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only
GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize
well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal
representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective
re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal
disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can
be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a
viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了具备网页浏览能力的大语言模型（LLMs）能否通过用户名推断社交媒体用户的 demographics，结果显示其具备一定准确性，但也存在偏见和滥用风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs依赖静态数据，无法实时获取信息。研究旨在探索LLMs通过网页浏览能力直接获取和分析社交媒体数据的潜力。

Method: 使用合成数据集（48个Twitter账户）和调查数据集（1,384名国际参与者），评估LLMs通过用户名推断用户 demographics 的能力。

Result: LLMs能够访问社交媒体内容并预测用户 demographics，但分析显示可能存在性别和政治偏见。

Conclusion: 该能力对计算社会科学有益，但也存在滥用风险，建议限制公开应用，仅保留受控研究访问。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training
data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements,
however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time
information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While
prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,
their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains
unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic
attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic
dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international
participants, we show that these models can access social media content and
predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic
dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,
which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal
activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science
in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information
operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We
recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing
applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research
purposes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的RAG框架，结合混合检索策略和元数据过滤，显著提升了企业数据处理的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业依赖专有数据进行决策，但现有LLMs和RAG框架在处理结构化数据时存在局限性。

Method: 采用混合检索策略（密集嵌入和BM25）、元数据过滤、语义分块和表格结构保留，优化检索效率。

Result: 实验显示Precision@5提升15%，Recall@5提升13%，Faithfulness等定性指标显著提高。

Conclusion: 框架有效提升了企业任务的准确性和相关性，未来将扩展至多模态数据和代理检索。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR
records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative
capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,
and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but
often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval
strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by
metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The
framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains
tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing
optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and
conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5
increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),
and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative
evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness
(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.
These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,
comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future
work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based
retrieval. The source code will be released at

Motivation: 探讨是否可以利用CoT预测最终回答的对齐风险，以减少有害内容的传播。

Method: 评估多种监控方法，包括人类、大语言模型和文本分类器，分析CoT文本或激活。

Result: 线性探针在CoT激活上的表现优于文本方法，且能在推理早期准确预测安全性。

Conclusion: 轻量级探针可实现实时安全监控和早期干预，适用于不同模型和任务。

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs)
before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces
additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the
CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to
predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring
approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text
classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple
linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all
text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or
unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,
while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive
signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning
completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT
segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety
benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety
monitoring and early intervention during generation.

TL;DR: S2WTM提出了一种新的主题建模方法，通过球面切片Wasserstein距离解决VAE-NTMs中的后验坍塌问题，生成更一致和多样化的主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VAE-NTMs在建模高维文本数据的超球面潜在表示时，常因后验坍塌导致潜在表示无效。

Method: S2WTM采用单位超球面上的先验分布，并利用球面切片Wasserstein距离对齐聚合后验分布与先验。

Result: 实验表明S2WTM优于现有主题模型，生成的主题更一致和多样化，下游任务表现更优。

Conclusion: S2WTM有效解决了后验坍塌问题，提升了主题建模的性能。

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven
effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data,
benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models
(VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical
structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL
divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to
ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling
hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced
Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior
distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical
Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with
the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms
state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics
while improving performance on downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索将数据选择目标显式化（而非隐式通过基准迭代）的效果，以更精准地塑造模型能力。

Method: 方法包括嵌入基准示例和预训练文档到共享空间，基于相似性评分，并训练轻量级分类器预测全语料库的分数。

Result: 实验结果表明，BETR在10项任务中9项表现更优，计算效率提升2.1倍，且适用于不同规模的模型。

Conclusion: 结论是直接匹配预训练数据与目标任务能有效提升模型能力，且数据选择策略需随模型规模调整。

Abstract: Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these
targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers
develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then
refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make
this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted
ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on
similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a
sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by
similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these
scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over
500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to
them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation
benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline
(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks
across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of
benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms
baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models
require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly
matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities
and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种分层协作的匝道合并控制框架（HCOMC），用于解决混合交通流中的匝道合并问题，结合纵向跟车和横向换道模型，并通过仿真验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速公路匝道合并区域是交通拥堵和事故的常见瓶颈，而基于联网自动驾驶车辆（CAV）的协作控制策略是根本解决方案。然而，由于CAV尚未普及，需要提出适用于混合交通流的控制框架。

Method: 论文扩展了基于智能驾驶员模型的纵向跟车模型和基于五次多项式曲线的横向换道模型，提出了HCOMC框架，包括分层协作规划模型、基于博弈论的自主换道模型和多目标优化模型。

Result: 仿真结果表明，HCOMC在提升车辆群安全性、稳定和加速合并过程、优化交通效率和节省燃油消耗方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: HCOMC框架为混合交通流中的匝道合并问题提供了有效的解决方案，尤其在CAV普及率较低的情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion
and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs
are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative
on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on
two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal
car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral
lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human
factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a
HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based
on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model
based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the
elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and
efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The
findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in
enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging
process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption
compared with benchmarks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CoNav Chair，一种基于ROS的智能轮椅，通过共享控制导航和避障功能提升导航效率、安全性和易用性。初步评估显示共享控制模式优于手动和全自动模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着残疾人口增长，现有电动轮椅在灵活性和导航能力上存在不足，需改进以提升独立生活和社会融入。

Method: 基于ROS设计CoNav Chair，比较手动、共享和全自动三种导航模式，通过21名健康参与者的室内实验评估性能。

Abstract: As the global population of people with disabilities (PWD) continues to grow,
so will the need for mobility solutions that promote independent living and
social integration. Wheelchairs are vital for the mobility of PWD in both
indoor and outdoor environments. The current SOTA in powered wheelchairs is
based on either manually controlled or fully autonomous modes of operation,
offering limited flexibility and often proving difficult to navigate in
spatially constrained environments. Moreover, research on robotic wheelchairs
has focused predominantly on complete autonomy or improved manual control;
approaches that can compromise efficiency and user trust. To overcome these
challenges, this paper introduces the CoNav Chair, a smart wheelchair based on
the Robot Operating System (ROS) and featuring shared control navigation and
obstacle avoidance capabilities that are intended to enhance navigational
efficiency, safety, and ease of use for the user. The paper outlines the CoNav
Chair's design and presents a preliminary usability evaluation comparing three
distinct navigation modes, namely, manual, shared, and fully autonomous,
conducted with 21 healthy, unimpaired participants traversing an indoor
building environment. Study findings indicated that the shared control
navigation framework had significantly fewer collisions and performed
comparably, if not superior to the autonomous and manual modes, on task
completion time, trajectory length, and smoothness; and was perceived as being
safer and more efficient based on user reported subjective assessments of
usability. Overall, the CoNav system demonstrated acceptable safety and
performance, laying the foundation for subsequent usability testing with end
users, namely, PWDs who rely on a powered wheelchair for mobility.

Abstract: In robotics, the effective integration of environmental data into actionable
knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the variety and
incompatibility of data formats commonly used in scene descriptions, such as
MJCF, URDF, and SDF. This paper presents a novel approach that addresses these
challenges by developing a unified scene graph model that standardizes these
varied formats into the Universal Scene Description (USD) format. This
standardization facilitates the integration of these scene graphs with robot
ontologies through semantic reporting, enabling the translation of complex
environmental data into actionable knowledge essential for cognitive robotic
control. We evaluated our approach by converting procedural 3D environments
into USD format, which is then annotated semantically and translated into a
knowledge graph to effectively answer competency questions, demonstrating its
utility for real-time robotic decision-making. Additionally, we developed a
web-based visualization tool to support the semantic mapping process, providing
users with an intuitive interface to manage the 3D environment.

of the existing data collection paradigm and learning framework, three key
challenges restricting the development of dexterous robotic manipulation are

Conclusion: 结合AD技术与AR需求，提出多模态传感器和边缘深度学习等方向，以推动安全高效的AR系统发展。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of micromobility solutions, particularly two-wheeled
vehicles like e-scooters and e-bikes, has created an urgent need for reliable
autonomous riding (AR) technologies. While autonomous driving (AD) systems have
matured significantly, AR presents unique challenges due to the inherent
instability of two-wheeled platforms, limited size, limited power, and
unpredictable environments, which pose very serious concerns about road users'
safety. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AR systems by
systematically examining their core components, perception, planning, and
control, through the lens of AD technologies. We identify critical gaps in
current AR research, including a lack of comprehensive perception systems for
various AR tasks, limited industry and government support for such
developments, and insufficient attention from the research community. The
review analyses the gaps of AR from the perspective of AD to highlight
promising research directions, such as multimodal sensor techniques for
lightweight platforms and edge deep learning architectures. By synthesising
insights from AD research with the specific requirements of AR, this review
aims to accelerate the development of safe, efficient, and scalable autonomous
riding systems for future urban mobility.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CDT-TCS的新算法，用于解决系留机器人在运动规划中的限制问题，并通过三种应用算法进一步优化路径规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系留机器人在特殊环境（如灾难响应和地下探索）中具有稳定供电和可靠通信的优势，但其运动规划受限于系留长度和缠绕风险，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: CDT-TCS算法利用CDT编码作为同伦不变量表示路径拓扑状态，结合代数拓扑和几何优化，一次性计算2D环境中所有位置的最优可行配置。

Result: 仿真和实验表明，该算法在各自问题领域中显著优于现有方法，并验证了其工程实用性。

Conclusion: CDT-TCS及其衍生算法为系留和自由机器人的路径规划提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Tethered robots play a pivotal role in specialized environments such as
disaster response and underground exploration, where their stable power supply
and reliable communication offer unparalleled advantages. However, their motion
planning is severely constrained by tether length limitations and entanglement
risks, posing significant challenges to achieving optimal path planning. To
address these challenges, this study introduces CDT-TCS (Convex Dissection
Topology-based Tethered Configuration Search), a novel algorithm that leverages
CDT Encoding as a homotopy invariant to represent topological states of paths.
By integrating algebraic topology with geometric optimization, CDT-TCS
efficiently computes the complete set of optimal feasible configurations for
tethered robots at all positions in 2D environments through a single
computation. Building on this foundation, we further propose three
application-specific algorithms: i) CDT-TPP for optimal tethered path planning,
ii) CDT-TMV for multi-goal visiting with tether constraints, iii) CDT-UTPP for
distance-optimal path planning of untethered robots. All theoretical results
and propositions underlying these algorithms are rigorously proven and
thoroughly discussed in this paper. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in their
respective problem domains. Furthermore, real-world experiments on robotic
platforms validate the practicality and engineering value of the proposed
framework.

Result: 通过建模、实验和开放水域测试验证了在线任务适应和语义更新的可行性。

Conclusion: NemeSys为动态水下环境中的目标驱动自适应AUV提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Adaptive mission control and dynamic parameter reconfiguration are essential
for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in GPS-denied,
communication-limited marine environments. However, most current AUV platforms
execute static, pre-programmed missions or rely on tethered connections and
high-latency acoustic channels for mid-mission updates, significantly limiting
their adaptability and responsiveness. In this paper, we introduce NemeSys, a
novel AUV system designed to support real-time mission reconfiguration through
compact optical and magnetoelectric (OME) signaling facilitated by floating
buoys. We present the full system design, control architecture, and a semantic
mission encoding framework that enables interactive exploration and task
adaptation via low-bandwidth communication. The proposed system is validated
through analytical modeling, controlled experimental evaluations, and
open-water trials. Results confirm the feasibility of online mission adaptation
and semantic task updates, highlighting NemeSys as an online AUV platform for
goal-driven adaptive autonomy in dynamic and uncertain underwater environments.

TL;DR: HyPRAP是一种基于混合预测的风险感知路径规划框架，通过选择性使用预测模型和新型碰撞风险指数（P-CRI），在密集动态环境中平衡安全性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决密集动态环境中实时路径规划的挑战，特别是预测大量动态障碍物未来运动的计算负担和不现实性。

Method: HyPRAP结合多种预测模型，利用P-CRI评估障碍物风险，选择性使用预测器，并通过混合共形预测量化不确定性。

Result: 理论分析和仿真表明，HyPRAP优于单一预测方法，P-CRI比基于邻近性的风险评估更有效。

Conclusion: HyPRAP在密集动态环境中实现了安全性和计算效率的平衡，适用于大规模障碍物场景。

Abstract: Real-time path planning in dense, uncertain environments remains a
challenging problem, as predicting the future motions of numerous dynamic
obstacles is computationally burdensome and unrealistic. To address this, we
introduce Hybrid Prediction-based Risk-Aware Planning (HyPRAP), a
prediction-based risk-aware path-planning framework which uses a hybrid
combination of models to predict local obstacle movement. HyPRAP uses a novel
Prediction-based Collision Risk Index (P-CRI) to evaluate the risk posed by
each obstacle, enabling the selective use of predictors based on whether the
agent prioritizes high predictive accuracy or low computational prediction
overhead. This selective routing enables the agent to focus on high-risk
obstacles while ignoring or simplifying low-risk ones, making it suitable for
environments with a large number of obstacles. Moreover, HyPRAP incorporates
uncertainty quantification through hybrid conformal prediction by deriving
confidence bounds simultaneously achieved by multiple predictions across
different models. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that HyPRAP effectively
balances safety and computational efficiency by leveraging the diversity of
prediction models. Extensive simulations validate these insights for more
general settings, confirming that HyPRAP performs better compared to single
predictor methods, and P-CRI performs better over naive proximity-based risk
assessment.

Conclusion: 相似性匹配方法为未知物体抓取提供了新视角，显著提升了鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic
in robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in
large-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.
However, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in
performance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental
changes. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,
we abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:
similarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the
grasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly
achieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key
steps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform
similarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,
identifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate
models with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the
unknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local
fine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy
observation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that
integrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive
evaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,
the C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between
partial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database
models. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce
the semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration
approach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under
single-view conditions. Videos are available at https://youtu.be/qQDIELMhQmk.

TL;DR: 提出了一种交互感知的神经网络增强模型预测路径积分控制（IANN-MPPI），用于自动驾驶车辆在密集交通中的轨迹规划，解决了传统方法过于保守的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆在密集交通中的运动规划常因无法预测周围车辆的交互行为而表现保守，传统方法忽略了车辆间的动态响应。

Method: 结合神经网络预测周围车辆对MPPI采样控制序列的反应，并引入基于样条的MPPI采样分布先验，优化车道变换行为。

Result: 在密集交通合并场景中，IANN-MPPI能够高效完成合并操作。

Conclusion: IANN-MPPI通过交互感知和优化采样分布，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通环境中的规划能力。

Abstract: Motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dense traffic is
challenging, often leading to overly conservative behavior and unmet planning
objectives. This challenge stems from the AVs' limited ability to anticipate
and respond to the interactive behavior of surrounding agents. Traditional
decoupled prediction and planning pipelines rely on non-interactive predictions
that overlook the fact that agents often adapt their behavior in response to
the AV's actions. To address this, we propose Interaction-Aware Neural
Network-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (IANN-MPPI) control, which
enables interactive trajectory planning by predicting how surrounding agents
may react to each control sequence sampled by MPPI. To improve performance in
structured lane environments, we introduce a spline-based prior for the MPPI
sampling distribution, enabling efficient lane-changing behavior. We evaluate
IANN-MPPI in a dense traffic merging scenario, demonstrating its ability to
perform efficient merging maneuvers. Our project website is available at

augmented generation), experimental systems, pilot deployments, and real-world
use cases. We highlight GAI's growing role in enabling underwater perception,
digital twin modeling, and autonomous planning for remotely operated vehicle
(ROV) missions. We also provide an updated application taxonomy that spans
sensing, control, optimization, communication, and regulatory compliance.
Beyond technical capabilities, we analyze key limitations, including limited
data availability, real-time performance constraints, trust and explainability,
environmental costs, and regulatory uncertainty. This review positions GAI not
merely as a tool but as a critical enabler of smart, resilient, and
environmentally aligned aquaculture systems.

Conclusion: 单步去噪扩散模型能有效提升自动驾驶车辆在交叉路口的决策鲁棒性。

Abstract: High-risk traffic zones such as intersections are a major cause of
collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety
of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step
denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor
noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection
based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the
generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a
single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed
while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible
application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the
autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently
sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to
inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner
demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the
baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.

Result: 鲁棒路径规划显著提升操作可靠性，椭球和DRSP方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: 鲁棒方法在恶劣天气和高行人密度下效果更显著，尤其适合较宽、较慢且导航保守的机器人。

Abstract: Sidewalk delivery robots are a promising solution for urban freight
distribution, reducing congestion compared to trucks and providing a safer,
higher-capacity alternative to drones. However, unreliable travel times on
sidewalks due to pedestrian density, obstacles, and varying infrastructure
conditions can significantly affect their efficiency. This study addresses the
robust route planning problem for sidewalk robots, explicitly accounting for
travel time uncertainty due to varying sidewalk conditions. Optimization is
integrated with simulation to reproduce the effect of obstacles and pedestrian
flows and generate realistic travel times. The study investigates three
different approaches to derive uncertainty sets, including budgeted,
ellipsoidal, and support vector clustering (SVC)-based methods, along with a
distributionally robust method to solve the shortest path (SP) problem. A
realistic case study reproducing pedestrian patterns in Stockholm's city center
is used to evaluate the efficiency of robust routing across various robot
designs and environmental conditions. The results show that, when compared to a
conventional SP, robust routing significantly enhances operational reliability
under variable sidewalk conditions. The Ellipsoidal and DRSP approaches
outperform the other methods, yielding the most efficient paths in terms of
average and worst-case delay. Sensitivity analyses reveal that robust
approaches consistently outperform the conventional SP, particularly for
sidewalk delivery robots that are wider, slower, and have more conservative
navigation behaviors. These benefits are even more pronounced in adverse
weather conditions and high pedestrian congestion scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园中单棵树的精准定位对农业机器人任务至关重要，但GPS信号不可靠且传统SLAM方法在重复树冠环境中易出错。

Method: 使用RGB-D图像和实例分割模型检测树干，通过级联图数据关联算法重识别树干，结合因子图框架整合GPS、里程计和树干观测。

Conclusion: Tree-SLAM在GPS信号不可靠的果园环境中表现出高精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is an important component for precision
agriculture in orchards, as it allows autonomous robots to perform tasks like
targeted operations or individual tree monitoring. However, creating these maps
is challenging because GPS signals are often unreliable under dense tree
canopies. Furthermore, standard Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
approaches struggle in orchards because the repetitive appearance of trees can
confuse the system, leading to mapping errors. To address this, we introduce
Tree-SLAM, a semantic SLAM approach tailored for creating maps of individual
trees in orchards. Utilizing RGB-D images, our method detects tree trunks with
an instance segmentation model, estimates their location and re-identifies them
using a cascade-graph-based data association algorithm. These re-identified
trunks serve as landmarks in a factor graph framework that integrates noisy GPS
signals, odometry, and trunk observations. The system produces maps of
individual trees with a geo-localization error as low as 18 cm, which is less
than 20\% of the planting distance. The proposed method was validated on
diverse datasets from apple and pear orchards across different seasons,
demonstrating high mapping accuracy and robustness in scenarios with unreliable
GPS signals.

Abstract: Walkability is a key component of sustainable urban development, while
collecting detailed data on its related features remains challenging due to the
high costs and limited scalability of traditional methods. Sidewalk delivery
robots, increasingly deployed in urban environments, offer a promising solution
to these limitations. This paper explores how these robots can serve as mobile
data collection platforms, capturing sidewalk-level features related to
walkability in a scalable, automated, and real-time manner. A sensor-equipped
robot was deployed on a sidewalk network at KTH in Stockholm, completing 101
trips covering 900 segments. From the collected data, different typologies of
features are derived, including robot trip characteristics (e.g., speed,
duration), sidewalk conditions (e.g., width, surface unevenness), and sidewalk
utilization (e.g., pedestrian density). Their walkability-related implications
were investigated with a series of analyses. The results demonstrate that
pedestrian movement patterns are strongly influenced by sidewalk
characteristics, with higher density, reduced width, and surface irregularity
associated with slower and more variable trajectories. Notably, robot speed
closely mirrors pedestrian behavior, highlighting its potential as a proxy for
assessing pedestrian dynamics. The proposed framework enables continuous
monitoring of sidewalk conditions and pedestrian behavior, contributing to the
development of more walkable, inclusive, and responsive urban environments.

Abstract: As industrial autonomous ground vehicles are increasingly deployed in
safety-critical environments, ensuring their safe operation under diverse
conditions is paramount. This paper presents a novel approach for their safety
verification based on systematic situation extraction, probabilistic modelling
and verification. We build upon the concept of a situation coverage grid, which
exhaustively enumerates environmental configurations relevant to the vehicle's
operation. This grid is augmented with quantitative probabilistic data
collected from situation-based system testing, capturing probabilistic
transitions between situations. We then generate a probabilistic model that
encodes the dynamics of both normal and unsafe system behaviour. Safety
properties extracted from hazard analysis and formalised in temporal logic are
verified through probabilistic model checking against this model. The results
demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies high-risk situations,
provides quantitative safety guarantees, and supports compliance with
regulatory standards, thereby contributing to the robust deployment of
autonomous systems.

Conclusion: 新方法高效解决了意图不确定性下的多智能体轨迹规划问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Trajectory planning involving multi-agent interactions has been a
long-standing challenge in the field of robotics, primarily burdened by the
inherent yet intricate interactions among agents. While game-theoretic methods
are widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent
interactions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating
the intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional
uncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing
game-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor
scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive
trajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties
of agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability.
As the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under
intentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its
agent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain
minor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive
trajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium
can be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we
present a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the
problem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant
outcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
is effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of
intentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing
centralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive
trajectory planning in uncertain game settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的LGL方法UniLGL，通过编码完整点云信息（几何和材质）到BEV图像，实现空间、材质和传感器类型的统一性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LGL方法仅考虑部分信息或针对同质LiDAR传感器，忽略了统一性。

Method: 将点云编码为空间和强度BEV图像，设计多BEV融合网络提取统一特征，引入视角不变性假设实现传感器类型统一。

Result: 实验验证UniLGL在真实环境中表现优异，支持多种平台应用。

Conclusion: UniLGL在工业和野外场景中具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Existing LGL methods typically consider only partial information (e.g.,
geometric features) from LiDAR observations or are designed for homogeneous
LiDAR sensors, overlooking the uniformity in LGL. In this work, a uniform LGL
method is proposed, termed UniLGL, which simultaneously achieves spatial and
material uniformity, as well as sensor-type uniformity. The key idea of the
proposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both
geometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial
BEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network
is designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and
material uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a
viewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional
translation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and
supervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors
and local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local
features on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose
estimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on
SE(3) without requiring additional registration. To validate the effectiveness
of the proposed uniform LGL, extensive benchmarks are conducted in real-world
environments, and the results show that the proposed UniLGL is demonstratively
competitive compared to other State-of-the-Art LGL methods. Furthermore, UniLGL
has been deployed on diverse platforms, including full-size trucks and agile
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), to enable high-precision localization and mapping
as well as multi-MAV collaborative exploration in port and forest environments,
demonstrating the applicability of UniLGL in industrial and field scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for enhancing robotic path
planning. This paper assesses visual input's utility for multimodal LLMs in
such tasks via a comprehensive benchmark. We evaluated 15 multimodal LLMs on
generating valid and optimal paths in 2D grid environments, simulating
simplified robotic planning, comparing text-only versus text-plus-visual inputs
across varying model sizes and grid complexities. Our results indicate moderate
success rates on simpler small grids, where visual input or few-shot text
prompting offered some benefits. However, performance significantly degraded on
larger grids, highlighting a scalability challenge. While larger models
generally achieved higher average success, the visual modality was not
universally dominant over well-structured text for these multimodal systems,
and successful paths on simpler grids were generally of high quality. These
results indicate current limitations in robust spatial reasoning, constraint
adherence, and scalable multimodal integration, identifying areas for future
LLM development in robotic path planning.

provide the solver with guesses for the mode switches and additional
constraints for the object placements. By interleaving the creation of regrasp
maps, their adaptation based on failed refinements, and solving TAMP

regrasp manipulation problems.

Abstract: Transmission switching is a well-established approach primarily applied to
minimize operational costs through strategic network reconfiguration. However,
exclusive focus on cost reduction can compromise system reliability. While
multi-objective transmission switching can balance cost savings with
reliability improvements, feasible solutions become exceedingly difficult to
obtain as system scale grows, due to the inherent nonlinearity and high
computational demands involved. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) method for multi-objective transmission switching. The method
incorporates a dueling-based actor-critic framework to evaluate the relative
impact of each line switching decision within the action space, which improves
decision quality and enhances both system reliability and cost efficiency.
Numerical studies on the IEEE 118-bus system verify the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed approach compared to two benchmark DRL algorithms.

Conclusion: NANO滤波器通过优化高斯近似和避免线性化，显著提升了非线性非高斯系统中的滤波性能，是一种高效且鲁棒的滤波算法。

Abstract: Popular Bayes filters typically rely on linearization techniques such as
Taylor series expansion and stochastic linear regression to use the structure
of standard Kalman filter. These techniques may introduce large estimation
errors in nonlinear and non-Gaussian systems. This paper overviews a recent
breakthrough in filtering algorithm design called \textit{N}atural
Gr\textit{a}dient Gaussia\textit{n} Appr\textit{o}ximation (NANO) filter and
compare its performance over a large class of nonlinear filters. The NANO
filter interprets Bayesian filtering as solutions to two distinct optimization
problems, which allows to define optimal Gaussian approximation and derive its
corresponding extremum conditions. The algorithm design still follows the
two-step structure of Bayes filters. In the prediction step, NANO filter
calculates the first two moments of the prior distribution, and this process is
equivalent to a moment-matching filter. In the update step, natural gradient
descent is employed to directly minimize the objective of the update step,
thereby avoiding errors caused by model linearization. Comparative tests are
conducted on four classic systems, including the damped linear oscillator,
sequence forecasting, modified growth model, and robot localization, under
Gaussian, Laplace, and Beta noise to evaluate the NANO filter's capability in
handling nonlinearity. Additionally, we validate the NANO filter's robustness
to data outliers using a satellite attitude estimation example. It is observed
that the NANO filter outperforms popular Kalman filters family such as extended
Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), iterated extended Kalman
filter (IEKF) and posterior linearization filter (PLF), while having similar
computational burden.

Method: 提出FB方法，中央单元向移动传感器反馈信息，以减少冗余传输和通信拥塞，并与传统非反馈（NF）架构进行性能比较。

Result: 理论分析和数值模拟表明，FB的可行性主要取决于通信功耗成本，而其优势则与传感器的传播延迟相关。

Conclusion: FB在特定条件下优于NF，且理论结果在复杂场景中仍适用。

Abstract: In distributed target-tracking sensor networks, efficient data gathering
methods are necessary to save communication resources and assure information
accuracy. This paper proposes a Feedback (FB) distributed data-gathering method
which lets the central unit feed information back to the mobile sensors; each
sensor then uses it to cancel redundant transmissions and reduce communication
congestion. We rigorously compare its performance, in terms of mean-squared
error (MSE) and cost of power per sensor, against more conventional
Non-Feedback (NF) architectures by evaluating conditions of feasibility and
advantage under different architecture specifications (e.g., communication
delay rate, power cost rate, maximum back-off time, sampling period,
observation noise). Here, we defined the advantage as the performance gain
achieved by FB over NF, while FB is said to be feasible if the advantage region
is nonempty. Our theoretical analyses show that the feasibility of FB depends
more on the communication power cost, while the advantage depends on the
sensors' propagation delay per transmission interval; we derive concrete
conditions under which these outcomes hold. Using extensive numerical
simulations under a variety of settings, we confirm the accuracy of the derived
conditions, and show that our theoretical results hold even for more complex
scenarios where the simplifying assumptions no longer hold.

Abstract: 6G networks are composed of subnetworks expected to meet ultra-reliable
low-latency communication (URLLC) requirements for mission-critical
applications such as industrial control and automation. An often-ignored aspect
in URLLC is consecutive packet outages, which can destabilize control loops and
compromise safety in in-factory environments. Hence, the current work proposes
a link adaptation framework to support extreme reliability requirements using
the soft actor-critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm
that jointly optimizes energy efficiency (EE) and reliability under dynamic
channel and interference conditions. Unlike prior work focusing on average
reliability, our method explicitly targets reducing burst/consecutive outages
through adaptive control of transmit power and blocklength based solely on the
observed signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The joint optimization
problem is formulated under finite blocklength and quality of service
constraints, balancing reliability and EE. Simulation results show that the
proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms, reducing
outage bursts while consuming only 18\% of the transmission cost required by a
full/maximum resource allocation policy in the evaluated scenario. The
framework also supports flexible trade-off tuning between EE and reliability by
adjusting reward weights, making it adaptable to diverse industrial
requirements.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of distributed resilient state estimation
and control for linear time-invariant systems in the presence of malicious
false data injection sensor attacks and bounded noise. We consider a system
operator (defender) capable of deploying cybersecurity measures to counteract
the sensor compromises. Although such measures enhance resilience against
adversarial attacks, they may incur substantial costs; hence, it is crucial to
select countermeasures to balance resilience gains and cost efficiency
strategically. We first demonstrate that the system's resilience against
attacks is maximized through the appropriate implementation of security
measures, implying that no attacker can execute undetectable sensor attacks.
Building on this analysis, we propose an algorithm that identifies the optimal
security measure. While determining this measure is NP-hard in general, we also
derive sufficient conditions under which efficient computation is feasible.
Furthermore, we develop a distributed resilient state estimation and control
scheme informed by the optimal security measure and establish conditions that
guarantee bounded estimation and control errors. Finally, we validate the
efficacy of our approach via numerical simulations of a vehicle platooning
scenario.

Abstract: Energy Harvesting technologies will play a fundamental role in the
development of the next generation of electronic systems as well as in
advancing the development of sustainable infrastructure. One of the critical
challenges in EH is utilizing ambient vibrations to harvest energy. Piezo
Energy Harvesting, which uses ambient vibrations, is a promising technology in
energy harvesting and a self-powered technology. However, it suffers from
several practical challenges. Some of these challenges include narrow
bandwidth, non-linearity, and impedance mismatch, among others. This paper
presents a novel, simulated Piezo Energy Harvesting (PEH) framework that
addresses some of these challenges. The proposed model is designed to be
adaptive and effective against the inherent non-linearity of PEH. This detailed
model covers a non-linear piezo, Synchronous Electric Charge Extraction (SECE),
Hybrid Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and a Switched Capacitor Array
(SCA). The SECE extracts the maximum charge accumulated on the piezo every time
the piezo reaches the mechanical extremum. The Bouc-Wen model has been used to
establish nonlinearity in the system. The hybrid MPPT exhibits significant
improvement over conventional P&O, while the SCA-tuned system demonstrates
resilience against variable frequency input.

Conclusion: 提出的双重架构有效解决了模型适应性问题，为动态系统的建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: This article addresses the challenge of adapting data-based models over time.
We propose a novel two-fold modelling architecture designed to correct
plant-model mismatch caused by two types of uncertainty. Out-of-domain
uncertainty arises when the system operates under conditions not represented in
the initial training dataset, while in-domain uncertainty results from
real-world variability and flaws in the model structure or training process. To
handle out-of-domain uncertainty, a slow learning component, inspired by the
human brain's slow thinking process, learns system dynamics under unexplored
operating conditions, and it is activated only when a monitoring strategy deems
it necessary. This component consists of an ensemble of models, featuring (i) a
combination rule that weights individual models based on the statistical
proximity between their training data and the current operating condition, and
(ii) a monitoring algorithm based on statistical control charts that supervises
the ensemble's reliability and triggers the offline training and integration of
a new model when a new operating condition is detected. To address in-domain
uncertainty, a fast learning component, inspired by the human brain's fast
thinking process, continuously compensates in real time for the mismatch of the
slow learning model. This component is implemented as a Gaussian process (GP)
model, trained online at each iteration using recent data while discarding
older samples. The proposed methodology is tested on a benchmark energy system
referenced in the literature, demonstrating that the combined use of slow and
fast learning components improves model accuracy compared to standard
adaptation approaches.

Method: 利用神经网络学习最小化控制哈密顿量的最优共态轨迹，通过QP求解器提取满足约束的控制输入。

Result: NCR在收敛误差和输入轨迹平滑度上优于非线性MPC，计算时间减少两个数量级。

Conclusion: NCR是一种高效的无监督学习框架，适用于实时非线性最优控制问题。

Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised learning framework for solving nonlinear
optimal control problems (OCPs) with input constraints in real-time. In this
framework, a neural network (NN) learns to predict the optimal co-state
trajectory that minimizes the control Hamiltonian for a given system, at any
system's state, based on the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP).
Specifically, the NN is trained to find the norm-optimal co-state solution that
simultaneously satisfies the nonlinear system dynamics and minimizes a
quadratic regulation cost. The control input is then extracted from the
predicted optimal co-state trajectory by solving a quadratic program (QP) to
satisfy input constraints and optimality conditions. We coin the term neural
co-state regulator (NCR) to describe the combination of the co-state NN and
control input QP solver. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the NCR, we
compare its feedback control performance with that of an expert nonlinear model
predictive control (MPC) solver on a unicycle model. Because the NCR's training
does not rely on expert nonlinear control solvers which are often suboptimal,
the NCR is able to produce solutions that outperform the nonlinear MPC solver
in terms of convergence error and input trajectory smoothness even for system
conditions that are outside its original training domain. At the same time, the
NCR offers two orders of magnitude less computational time than the nonlinear
MPC.

Conclusion: 该模型为FACTS设备的多周期调度提供了可行且高效的解决方案，有助于电网稳定和可再生能源集成。

Abstract: With the increasing energy demand and the growing integration of renewable
sources of energy, power systems face operational challenges such as overloads,
losses, and stability concerns, particularly as networks operate near their
capacity limits. Flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS)
devices are essential to ensure reliable grid operations and enable the
efficient integration of renewable energy. This work introduces a mixed-integer
second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model for the multi-period scheduling of
key FACTS devices in electric transmission systems. The proposed model
integrates four key control mechanisms: (i) on-load tap changers (OLTCs) for
voltage regulation via discrete taps; (ii) static synchronous compensators
(STATCOMs) and (iii) shunt reactors for reactive power compensation; and (iv)
thyristor-controlled series capacitors (TCSCs) for adjustable impedance and
flow control. The objective is to minimize active power losses using a limited
number of control actions while meeting physical and operational constraints at
all times throughout the defined time horizon. To ensure tractability, the
model employs a second-order cone relaxation of the power flow. Device-specific
constraints are handled via binary expansion and linearization: OLTCs and shunt
reactors are modelled with discrete variables, STATCOMs through reactive power
bounds, and TCSCs using a reformulation-linearization technique (RLT). A
multi-period formulation captures the sequential nature of decision making,
ensuring consistency across time steps. The model is evaluated on the IEEE
9-bus, 30-bus, and RTS96 test systems, demonstrating its ability to reduce
losses, with potential applicability to larger-scale grids.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring robustness in the presence of
system perturbations for symbolic control techniques. Given a discrete-time
control system that is related to its symbolic model by an alternating
simulation relation. In this paper, we focus on computing the maximum
robustness margin under which the symbolic model remains valid for a
perturbed-version of the discrete-time control system. We first show that
symbolic models are inherently equipped with a certain free robustness margins.
We then provide constructive procedures to compute uniform and non-uniform
(state and input dependent) robustness margins. We also show that the tightness
of the robustness margin depends on the tightness of the reachability technique
used to compute the symbolic model. We then explain how the computed robustness
margin can be used for the sake of controller synthesis. Finally, we present
two illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Bit-serial computation facilitates bit-wise sequential data processing,
offering numerous benefits, such as a reduced area footprint and
dynamically-adaptive computational precision. It has emerged as a prominent
approach, particularly in leveraging bit-level sparsity in Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs). However, existing bit-serial accelerators exploit bit-level sparsity to
reduce computations by skipping zero bits, but they suffer from inefficient
memory accesses due to the irregular indices of the non-zero bits.
  As memory accesses typically are the dominant contributor to DNN accelerator
performance, this paper introduces a novel computing approach called
"bit-column-serial" and a compatible architecture design named "BitWave."
BitWave harnesses the advantages of the "bit-column-serial" approach,
leveraging structured bit-level sparsity in combination with dynamic dataflow
techniques. This achieves a reduction in computations and memory footprints
through redundant computation skipping and weight compression. BitWave is able
to mitigate the performance drop or the need for retraining that is typically
associated with sparsity-enhancing techniques using a post-training
optimization involving selected weight bit-flips. Empirical studies conducted
on four deep-learning benchmarks demonstrate the achievements of BitWave: (1)
Maximally realize 13.25x higher speedup, 7.71x efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art sparsity-aware accelerators. (2) Occupying 1.138 mm2 area and
consuming 17.56 mW power in 16nm FinFet process node.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用分割模型（如SAM和MedSAM）无法直接用于医学影像中的精细解剖标志分割，需解决这一局限性。

Method: 利用YOLO生成边界框作为SAM的输入提示，结合两者优势构建可靠的分割流程。

Result: 模型在分割8个解剖标志的基础上，扩展到72个标志和16个复杂区域，表现优异。

Conclusion: YOLO与SAM的结合为骨科骨盆X光片的分割提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics,
with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for
information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such
as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of
the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the
prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to
recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations
for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has
been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their
parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic
landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another
general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection
and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO
is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in
segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable
pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical
landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex
outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using
YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to
accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the
proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting
anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

Conclusion: 3D-WLDM为MR-to-CT合成提供了一种有效解决方案，有望提升临床工作流程的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging plays an essential role in contemporary
clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic
workflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance
(PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are
critically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is
typically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR
scans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis
methods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between
the generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for
reliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D
Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by
performing modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a
Wavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the
capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent
spaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we
disentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the
structural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip
Connection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the
generation of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony
structures and soft-tissue contrast.

Motivation: 新生儿肺动脉高压（PH）的诊断依赖超声心动图，但其准确性受操作者影响且现有自动化方法多针对成人，泛化能力不足。多视角超声心动图虽有望改善PH评估，但现有模型泛化能力有限。

Result: 结果表明，多视角学习方法在泛化能力和分类准确性上优于单视角和监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 多视角学习为新生儿PH的稳健评估提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns is a critical condition characterized
by elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular
strain and heart failure. While right heart catheterization (RHC) is the
diagnostic gold standard, echocardiography is preferred due to its non-invasive
nature, safety, and accessibility. However, its accuracy highly depends on the
operator, making PH assessment subjective. While automated detection methods
have been explored, most models focus on adults and rely on single-view
echocardiographic frames, limiting their performance in diagnosing PH in
newborns. While multi-view echocardiography has shown promise in improving PH
assessment, existing models struggle with generalizability. In this work, we
employ a multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE) for PH prediction using
echocardiographic videos. By leveraging the VAE framework, our model captures
complex latent representations, improving feature extraction and robustness. We
compare its performance against single-view and supervised learning approaches.
Our results show improved generalization and classification accuracy,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-view learning for robust PH assessment
in newborns.

Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of
capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for
zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested
in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or
abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more
challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly
difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation
caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal
structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.
Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level
of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a
comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for
breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,
MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that
capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and
patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that
foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional
registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large
domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular
tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or
breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration
performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to
understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore
targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure
accuracy. We also publicly release our code at
\href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of myocardial lesions from multi-sequence cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging is essential for cardiac disease diagnosis and
treatment planning. However, achieving optimal feature correspondence is
challenging due to intensity variations across modalities and spatial
misalignment caused by inconsistent slice acquisition protocols. We propose
CAA-Seg, a composite alignment-aware framework that addresses these challenges
through a two-stage approach. First, we introduce a selective slice alignment
method that dynamically identifies and aligns anatomically corresponding slice
pairs while excluding mismatched sections, ensuring reliable spatial
correspondence between sequences. Second, we develop a hierarchical alignment
network that processes multi-sequence features at different semantic levels,
i.e., local deformation correction modules address geometric variations in
low-level features, while global semantic fusion blocks enable semantic fusion
at high levels where intensity discrepancies diminish. We validate our method
on a large-scale dataset comprising 397 patients. Experimental results show
that our proposed CAA-Seg achieves superior performance on most evaluation
metrics, with particularly strong results in myocardial infarction
segmentation, representing a substantial 5.54% improvement over
state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at

Result: 在459个H&E染色区域的386,371个图块上评估，UTS优于U-Net变体和基于变换器的基线方法。

Conclusion: UTS在减少标注和计算成本的同时，保持了分割准确性，适用于临床任务如肿瘤-间质定量和手术边缘评估。

Abstract: We propose UTS, a unit-based tissue segmentation framework for histopathology
that classifies each fixed-size 32 * 32 tile, rather than each pixel, as the
segmentation unit. This approach reduces annotation effort and improves
computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this
approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits
the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology
and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three
categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports
clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical
margin assessment. Evaluated on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&E-stained regions, it
outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines. Code and Dataset
will be available at GitHub.

Abstract: In this chapter we provide a thorough overview of the use of energy-based
models (EBMs) in the context of inverse imaging problems. EBMs are probability
distributions modeled via Gibbs densities $p(x) \propto \exp{-E(x)}$ with an
appropriate energy functional $E$. Within this chapter we present a rigorous
theoretical introduction to Bayesian inverse problems that includes results on
well-posedness and stability in the finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional
setting. Afterwards we discuss the use of EBMs for Bayesian inverse problems
and explain the most relevant techniques for learning EBMs from data. As a
crucial part of Bayesian inverse problems, we cover several popular algorithms
for sampling from EBMs, namely the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, Gibbs
sampling, Langevin Monte Carlo, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Moreover, we
present numerical results for the resolution of several inverse imaging
problems obtained by leveraging an EBM that allows for the explicit
verification of those properties that are needed for valid energy-based
modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法对HDR内容泛化能力不足，需改进。

Method: FR模型使用Swin Transformer提取特征计算相似性；NR模型使用SigLip 2提取全局特征。通过预训练和微调解决数据不足问题。

Result: 模型在FR和NR任务中表现最佳，FR模型在IEEE ICME 2025挑战赛中夺冠。

Conclusion: CompressedVQA-HDR框架有效解决了HDR视频质量评估问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Video compression is a standard procedure applied to all videos to minimize
storage and transmission demands while preserving visual quality as much as
possible. Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is
crucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video
compression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment
(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability
needed to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high
dynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an
effective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality
assessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the
backbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
VQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and
textural similarities between reference and distorted frames using
intermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its
quality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global
mean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware
representation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we
pre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA
dataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ
an iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA
datasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental
results show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing FR and NR VQA models. Moreover, CompressedVQA-HDR-FR won first place
in the FR track of the Generalizable HDR & SDR Video Quality Measurement Grand
Challenge at IEEE ICME 2025. The code is available at
https://github.com/sunwei925/CompressedVQA-HDR.

Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment
response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for
developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning
can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images
that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering
networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a
low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting
tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver
associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the
vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal
liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method
identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and
enables a better separation between treatment groups than established
non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy
derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a
separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
method.

Abstract: Cortical lesions (CLs) have emerged as valuable biomarkers in multiple
sclerosis (MS), offering high diagnostic specificity and prognostic relevance.
However, their routine clinical integration remains limited due to subtle
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance, challenges in expert annotation,
and a lack of standardized automated methods. We propose a comprehensive
multi-centric benchmark of CL detection and segmentation in MRI. A total of 656
MRI scans, including clinical trial and research data from four institutions,
were acquired at 3T and 7T using MP2RAGE and MPRAGE sequences with
expert-consensus annotations. We rely on the self-configuring nnU-Net
framework, designed for medical imaging segmentation, and propose adaptations
tailored to the improved CL detection. We evaluated model generalization
through out-of-distribution testing, demonstrating strong lesion detection
capabilities with an F1-score of 0.64 and 0.5 in and out of the domain,
respectively. We also analyze internal model features and model errors for a
better understanding of AI decision-making. Our study examines how data
variability, lesion ambiguity, and protocol differences impact model
performance, offering future recommendations to address these barriers to
clinical adoption. To reinforce the reproducibility, the implementation and
models will be publicly accessible and ready to use at
https://github.com/Medical-Image-Analysis-Laboratory/ and
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15911797.
